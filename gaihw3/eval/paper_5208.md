Abstract

Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token
prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that “Not all
tokens in a corpus are equally important for language model training”. Our initial
analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing
distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a
new language model called RHO-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict
every next token in a corpus, RHO-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM),
which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution.
This approach involves scoring tokens using a reference model, and then training
the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When
continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, RHO-1 yields an absolute
improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning,
RHO-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH
dataset, respectively — matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining
tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, RHO-1
achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both data
efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.

Introduction

Scaling up model parameters and dataset size has consistently elevated the next-token prediction
accuracy in large language models, yielding significant advancements in artificial intelligence [Kaplan
et al., 2020, Brown et al., 2020, OpenAI, 2023, Team et al., 2023]. However, training on all available
data is not always optimal or feasible. As a result, the practice of data filtering has become crucial,
using various heuristics and classifiers [Brown et al., 2020, Wenzek et al., 2019] to select training
documents. These techniques significantly improve data quality and boost model performance.

However, despite thorough document-level filtering, high-quality datasets still contain many noisy
tokens that can negatively affect training, as illustrated in Figure 2 (Upper). Removing such tokens
might alter the text’s meaning, while overly strict filtering could exclude useful data [Welbl et al.,
2021, Muennighoff et al., 2024] and lead to biases [Dodge et al., 2021, Longpre et al., 2023].
Furthermore, research indicates that the distribution of web data does not inherently align with the
ideal distribution for downstream applications [Tay et al., 2022, Wettig et al., 2023]. For example,
common corpus at the token level may include undesirable content like hallucinations or highly
ambiguous tokens that are hard to predict. Applying the same loss to all tokens can lead to inefficient
computation on non-essential tokens, potentially restricting LLMs from achieving more advanced
levels of intelligence.

To explore how language models learn at the token level, we initially examined training dynamics,
particularly how the token-level loss evolves during usual pretraining. In §2.1, we evaluated the
model’s token perplexity at different checkpoints and categorized tokens into different types. Our
findings reveal that significant loss reduction is limited to a select group of tokens. Many tokens are
“easy tokens” that are already learned, and some are “hard tokens” that exhibit variable losses and
resist convergence. These tokens can lead to numerous ineffective gradient updates.

Based on these analyses, we introduce RHO-1 models trained with a novel Selective Language
Modeling (SLM) objective. As shown in Figure 2 (Right), this approach inputs the full sequence into
the model and selectively removes the loss of undesired tokens. The detailed pipeline is depicted
in Figure 4: First, SLM trains a reference language model on high-quality corpora. This model
establishes utility metrics to score tokens according to the desired distribution, naturally filtering
out unclean and irrelevant tokens. Second, SLM uses the reference model to score each token in a
corpus using its loss (§2.2). Finally, we train a language model only on those tokens that exhibit a
high excess loss between the reference and the training model, selectively learning the tokens that
best benefit downstream applications (§2.2).

We show through comprehensive experiments that SLM significantly enhances token efficiency during
training and improves performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that SLM
effectively identifies tokens relevant to the target distribution, resulting in improved perplexity scores
on benchmarks for models trained with the selected tokens. §3.2 shows the effectiveness of SLM on

math continual pretraining: both 1B and 7B RHO-1 outperform CLM-trained baselines by over 16%
on the GSM8k and MATH datasets. SLM reaches baseline accuracy up to 10x faster, as shown in
Figure 1. Remarkably, RHO-1-7B matches the state-of-the-art performance of DeepSeekMath-7B
using only 15B tokens, compared to the 500B tokens required by DeepSeekMath. Upon fine-tuning,
RHO-1-1B and 7B achieve 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH, respectively. Notably, RHO-1-1B is the
first 1B LM to exceed 40% accuracy, nearing the early GPT-4’s CoT performance of 42.5%. §3.3
confirms the efficacy of SLM in general continual pretraining: Training Tinyllama-1B on 80B tokens
with SLM improves 6.8% on average across 15 benchmarks, with gains over 10% in code and math
tasks. In §3.4, we demonstrate that in settings without high-quality reference data, we can use SLM
for self-referencing, leading to an average improvement of up to 3.3% in downstream tasks.

2.1
Not All Tokens Are Equal: Training Dynamics of Token Loss

Our investigation begins with a critical look at how individual tokens’ losses evolve during standard
pre-training. We continue pre-training Tinyllama-1B with 15B tokens from OpenWebMath, saving
checkpoints after every 1B tokens. We then evaluate token-level loss at these intervals using the
validation set of approximately 320,000 tokens. Figure 3(a) reveals a striking pattern: tokens
fall into four categories based on their loss trajectory—persistent high loss (H→H), increasing
loss (L→H), decreasing loss (H→L), and consistent low loss (L→L). For further details on these
categories, see §D.1. Our analysis uncovers that a mere 26% of tokens show a notable loss reduction
(H→L), while the majority (51%) remain in the L→L category, indicating they have already been
learned. Interestingly, 11% of the tokens are persistently challenging (H→H), likely due to high
aleatoric uncertainty [Hüllermeier and Waegeman, 2021]. Additionally, 12% of tokens experience an
unexpected loss increase (L→H) during training.

Our second observation is that a significant number of token losses exhibit persistent fluctuations,
and resist convergence. The loss of many L→L and H→H tokens, as depicted in Figure 3 (b) and (c),
show high variance during training. In §D.2, we visualize and analyze the content of these tokens and
find that many of them are noisy, which is consistent with our hypothesis.

Consequently, we learn that the loss associated with each token during training does not decrease
smoothly like the overall loss; instead, there is a complex training dynamic among different tokens.
If we can select the appropriate tokens for the model to focus on during training, we may be able to
stabilize the trajectory of the model’s training and enhance its data efficiency.

Selective Language Modeling

Overview
Inspired by the practice of reference model in document-level filtering, we propose a
simple pipeline of token-level data selection, termed “Selective Language Modeling (SLM)”. Our
method comprises three steps, as depicted in Figure 4. We begin by training a reference model on a
curated, high-quality dataset. This model then assesses the loss of each token within the pretraining
corpus. In the final phase, we train the language model selectively, focusing on tokens with high

performance by concentrating on valuable, clean tokens during pre-training. It involves three steps:

loss in a corpus using the reference model. (Step 3) Finally, selectively train the language model on

excess loss between the training and reference model. The intuition is that tokens with high excess
loss are more learnable and better aligned with the desired distribution, naturally excluding tokens
that are either irrelevant or of low quality. Below, we provide a detailed description of each step.

Reference Modeling
We begin by curating a high-quality dataset that reflects the desired data
distribution. We train a reference model (RM) using standard cross-entropy loss on the curated data.
The resulting RM is then used to assess the token loss within a larger pretraining corpus. We compute
the reference loss (LRM) of a token xi based on the probability that the RM assigns to this token. The
calculation is formalized as follows:

LRM(xi) = −log P(xi|x<i)
(1)

By evaluating LRM for each token, we establish the reference loss for selective pretraining, allowing
us to focus on the most influential tokens in language modeling.

Selective Pretraining
Note that Causal Language Modeling (CLM) employs the cross-entropy
loss:

LCLM(θ) = −1

N

N
X

i=1
log P(xi|x<i; θ)
(2)

Here, LCLM(θ) represents the loss function parameterized by model θ. N is the length of the sequence,
xi is the i-th token in the sequence, and x<i represents all tokens before the i-th token. In contrast,
Selective Language Modeling (SLM) trains the language model with a focus on tokens that exhibit
a high excess loss when compared to the reference model. The excess loss (L∆) for a token xi is
defined as the difference between the current training model loss (Lθ) and the reference loss:

L∆(xi) = Lθ(xi) −LRM(xi)
(3)

We introduce a token selection ratio k%, which determines the proportion of tokens to be included
based on their excess loss. The cross-entropy loss for the selected tokens is computed as follows:

LSLM(θ) = −
1
N ∗k%

N

i=1
Ik%(xi) · log P(xi|x<i; θ)

Here, N ∗k% defines the number of tokens that fall within the top k% of excess loss. The indicator
function Ik%(xi) is defined as:

Ik%(xi) =
1
if xi ranks in the top k% by S(xi)

By default, we use L∆as the score function S. This ensures that the loss is applied only to the tokens
that are deemed most beneficial for the language model to learn from. In practice, token selection can
be implemented by ranking the tokens in a batch according to their excess loss and using only the top
k% of tokens for training. This process eliminates the loss for undesired tokens without incurring
additional costs during pretraining, making our approach both efficient and easily integrated.

Experiments

We continually pretrained models in both mathematical and general domain and designed ablation
and analysis experiments to understand the effectiveness of SLM.

3.1
Experimental Setup

Reference Model Training
To train our mathematical reference model, we gathered a dataset of
0.5B high-quality, math-related tokens. This dataset is a blend of synthetic data from GPT [Yu et al.,
2024, Huang et al., 2024] and manually curated data [Yue et al., 2024, Ni et al., 2024]. For the general
reference model, we compiled a corpus of 1.9B tokens from open-source datasets, such as Tulu-v2
[Ivison et al., 2023] and OpenHermes-2.5 [Teknium, 2023]. We trained the reference models for 3
epochs. The maximum learning rate was set at 5e-5 for 1B models and 1e-5 for 7B models, applying
a cosine decay schedule. We set the maximum sequence lengths to 2048 for 1B models and 4096 for
7B models, packing multiple samples into these lengths for model input. In all main experiments, we
initialized the continual pretraining model and the reference model with the same base model.

Pretraining Corpus
For mathematical reasoning, we utilize the OpenWebMath (OWM) dataset
[Paster et al., 2023], which comprises approximately 14B tokens sourced from math-related web
pages in the Common Crawl. In the general domain, we combine the SlimPajama [Daria et al., 2023]
and StarCoderData [Li et al., 2023a] (both part of the Tinyllama corpus) with OpenWebMath, training
on a total of 80 billion tokens with a mix ratio of 6:3:1.

Pretraining Setting
For math pretraining, we continue pretraining on the Tinyllama-1.1B model
[Zhang et al., 2024] and the Mistral-7B model [Jiang et al., 2023] with learning rates of 8e-5 and
2e-5, respectively. For the 1.1B model, we conducted our training on 32 × H100 80G GPUs. This
configuration allowed us to train approximately 15 billion tokens in around 3.5 hours and 50 billion
tokens in about 12 hours. In the case of the 7B model, training the same 15 billion tokens took
approximately 18 hours under similar hardware conditions. For general domain, we set the learning
rate for Tinyllama-1.1B model to 1e-4 and train 80B tokens under the same hardware conditions,
which takes approximately 19 hours. The batch size is uniformly set to 1M tokens for both domains.
Regarding the token selection ratio, we use 60% for the Tinyllama-1.1B model and 70% for the
Mistral-7B model.

Baseline Setting
We use models that have been continually pretrained (Tinyllama-CT and Mistral-
CT) through regular causal language modeling as baselines. Moreover, we compare RHO-1 with

et al., 2024]. For fine-tuning results, we also compare with previous best models MAmmoTH[Yue
et al., 2024] and ToRA[Gou et al., 2024].

Evaluation Setup
To comprehensively evaluate pretrained models, we compare their few-shot
capabilities and fine-tuning performance across a variety of tasks. We adopt the lm-eval-harness3 [Gao
et al., 2023] for general tasks, and develop math evaluation suite4 for math tasks. We use vllm
(v0.3.2) [Kwon et al., 2023] to speed up inference. Further details on our evaluation can be found in
Appendix E.

Math Pre-training Results

Few-shot CoT Reasoning Results
We evalute base models prompting with few-shot chain-of-
thought (CoT) [Wei et al., 2022a] examples following previous works [Lewkowycz et al., 2022,
Azerbayev et al., 2023, Shao et al., 2024]. As results shown in Table 1, in comparison to continue
pretraining directly, RHO-1-Math has achieved the average few-shot accuracy improvement of

---Page Break---
16.5% on 1B models and 10.4% on 7B models. Furthermore, after training for multiple epochs on
OpenWebMath, we find that RHO-1 could further increase the average few-shot accuracy to 40.9%.
Compared to DeepSeekMath-7B, which pretrained on 500 billion math-related tokens, RHO-1-7B
pretrained on only 15 billion tokens (selecting 10.5 billion tokens) achieved comparable results,
demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.

Tool-Integrated Reasoning Results
We fine-tune RHO-1 and baseline models on 69k ToRA corpus
[Gou et al., 2024], consisting of 16k GPT-4-generated trajectories in a tool-integrated reasoning
format, and 53k answer-augmented samples using LLaMA. As presented in Table 2, RHO-1-1B
and RHO-1-7B achieved a state-of-the-art 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively. On
some unseen tasks (e.g., TabMWP and GSM-Hard), RHO-1 also demonstrates a certain degree of
generalizability, with an average few-shot accuracy improvement of 6.2% on the RHO-1-Math-1B
and 2.7% on RHO-1-Math-7B.

3.3
General Pre-training Results

We confirm the efficacy of the SLM in general pretraining by continual training Tinyllama-1.1B
on 80 billion tokens. The results depicted in Figure 5 indicate that although Tinyllama has already
undergone extensive training on the majority of these tokens, the application of SLM yields an
average enhancement of 6.8% across 15 benchmarks compared to direct continual pretraining. The
improvements were especially pronounced in code and math tasks, exceeding 10%.

3.4
Self-Reference Results

In this section, we demonstrate that SLM can enhance the effectiveness of model pre-training using
only pre-training corpora, without the need for additional high-quality data. Specifically, we initially
trained the reference model on the OpenWebMath (OWM) corpus, a subset of Proof-Pile-2 (PPile).
We evaluated OWM and PPile using the trained reference model and selected tokens for training.
In this scenario, we assume the absence of downstream task-related data, a common situation in
real-world applications. We hypothesize that the key factor is not scoring the desired distribution
but filtering out noisy tokens. Therefore, we employed two different scoring functions based on the
reference model loss, LRM, and the information entropy of the next token, HRM, which measures the
uncertainty of the next token. Details are provided in Appendix H.

Figure 6: The dynamics of pretraining loss and downstream loss. (a) and (c) represent the loss of
tokens selected/unselected by SLM during pretraining in both SLM and CLM methods, while (b)
represents the loss of the SLM and CLM methods on MetaMath [Yu et al., 2024]. We tested the
above results through the process of pretraining with a total of 4 billion tokens.

The experimental results, as shown in Table 3, indicate that using only the OWM-trained reference
model can effectively guide the model in pre-training on the same corpus, improving average
downstream performance by +2.4%. Using only the information entropy as the score function
brought about a similar improvement. Additionally, we considered training on the intersection of
tokens selected by the two scoring functions and found better performance, with a 40% reduction in
tokens and +3.3% performance. Furthermore, training the SLM on the PPile, despite only using the
OWM subset to train the reference model, still achieved a 1.8% improvement with 30% fewer tokens
used. For more details, please refer to Appendix H.

3.5
Ablation Study and Analysis

Selected Token Loss Aligns Better with Downstream Performance
We utilized the reference
model to filter tokens and assess their impact on validation and downstream losses after training. As
depicted in Figure 6, we pretrained on 4B tokens and tracked loss variations across methods and
validation sets. The RHO-1 showed greater loss reduction on selected tokens than regular pretraining.
Cross-referencing figures (a), (b), and (c) reveals that selected-token pretraining substantially lowers
downstream loss, while traditional pretraining’s effect on downstream loss is less pronounced despite
initial loss reductions. Therefore, we expect that selecting tokens for pretraining is more efficient.

In Figure 7, we demonstrate that the loss of selected tokens correlates with downstream task perfor-
mance, following a power law similar to recent findings [Gadre et al., 2024]. Our analysis shows
that tokens selected by SLM positively impact performance, while those not selected have a negative
impact. Thus, reducing loss across all tokens is not imperative for improved model performance.
Refer to Appendix F for further details.

What Tokens are Selected with SLM?
We aim to analyze the tokens selected by the SLM method
in pretraining to further explore its working mechanism. To this end, we visualize the token selection
process during the training of RHO-1 using the OpenWebMath. In §G.1, we have highlighted in blue
the tokens that were retained during actual pretraining. We observe that the majority of tokens chosen

by the SLM method are closely related to mathematics, effectively training the model on the parts of
the original corpus that are pertinent to mathematical content.

Furthermore, we investigated the differences in token filtering across various checkpoints during the
training process and tested the perplexity of these tokens on different checkpoints. As illustrated
in Figure 8, we found that the tokens selected by later checkpoints tend to have higher perplexity
towards the later stages of training and lower perplexity in the earlier stages. This may suggest that
the model first optimizes tokens with a larger learnable space, thereby increasing learning efficiency.
Moreover, we noticed a sample-wise “double descent” [Nakkiran et al., 2021] on the loss of selected
tokens, where the select token’s perplexity initially increases before decreases. This might be an
effect of selecting tokens based on excess loss, targeting those most in need at each checkpoint.

Effect of Token Select Ratio
We investigate the impact of token selecting ratios of the SLM.
Generally, the selecting ratio is defined by heuristic rules, similar to the approach previously employed
in the training of Masked Language Models (MLMs) [Devlin et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019]. As shown
in Figure 9, the selected tokens is suitable for accounting for about 60% of the original tokens.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose using Selective Language Modeling(SLM) to train RHO-1, which select
more suitable tokens for current pretraining stage. We conducted the detailed analysis of the loss of
tokens during the pretraining process and found that not all tokens are equal during pretraining. Our

experiments and analysis in the fields of mathematics and general have demonstrated the effectiveness
of the SLM method, emphasizing the importance of token level in the LLM pretraining process.
In the future, how to improve pretraining of LLMs from the perspective of token level worthy of
in-depth research.

B.1
Pretraining Data Optimization

The objective of optimizing pre-training corpora is to maximize the performance and efficiency
of language model training by improving the quality and scale of the pretrain data mixture. This
includes data collecting through crawling [Raffel et al., 2020] or synthesis [Polu and Sutskever, 2020,
Gunasekar et al., 2023], de-duplication [Lee et al., 2021, Kandpal et al., 2022, Tirumala et al., 2023],
filtering and selection [Xie et al., 2024a, Albalak et al., 2024], as well as data composition [Xie et al.,
2024b] and curriculum [Chen et al., 2024, Ma et al., 2024].

B.2
Data Selection

Data selection for fine-tuning has been extensively studied, focusing on improving quality [Li et al.,
2023c], diversity [Liu et al., 2024], and distribution matching [Li et al., 2023d, Xia et al., 2024, Ni
et al., 2024, Kang et al., 2024]. For pretraining, various lightweight filters are utilized [Albalak et al.,
2024], including heuristic-based (e.g., language and item count filtering), classifier-based [Brown
et al., 2020], and perplexity or loss-based approaches [Wenzek et al., 2019, Qin et al., 2024]. The
massive public RedPajama-Data-v2 dataset [Computer, 2023], for example, leverages over 40 quality
indicators for data filtering and reweighting. Nevertheless, strict filtering like blocklist [Raffel et al.,
2020] and Safety API filtering [Welbl et al., 2021], have been found to hurt evaluation loss or induce
bias [Dodge et al., 2021].

Sample-level selection has been extensively studied in previous research, particularly through online
batch selection methods [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2015, Schaul et al., 2015, Katharopoulos and Fleuret,
2018, Jiang et al., 2019]. These approaches have been successfully applied to diverse classification
tasks [Mindermann et al., 2022] and language modeling [Fan and Jaggi, 2023].

Token-level training strategies have also been explored, especially for the pre-training of BERT-like
models using Masked Language Modeling (MLM) [Devlin et al., 2018]. Specifically, “selective
masking” involves masking important tokens in the input to focus on learning tokens that are more
relevant to downstream tasks [Gu et al., 2020, Lad et al., 2022], whereas “token dropping” aims
to reduce training costs by omitting less important tokens [Zhong et al., 2023a, Hou et al., 2022].
Additionally, some research has approached the analysis and detection of under-trained tokens from a
tokenization perspective [Rumbelow and Watkins, 2023, Land and Bartolo, 2024]. To our knowledge,
we are the first to explore token-level data selection for large language model training, aimed at
enhancing data quality and information density at the most fundamental granularity.

B.3
Language Model Training Dynamics

Investigating the training dynamics of language models is essential for understanding their behavior
throughout the training process. This research includes studying internal representations [Saphra
and Lopez, 2018], the acquisition of linguistic knowledge [Choshen et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2021],
and the phenomenon of grokking [Power et al., 2022]. The analysis by Xia et al. [2022] is the most
related to ours, which examines token-level training trajectories in models of varying sizes. Our
findings, however, diverge from those of Xia et al. [2022], who posit that tokens with little change in

18


---Page Break---
perplexity are “already learned”. We identify a spectrum of token patterns, including “easy tokens”
and “hard tokens” that resist convergence. Recognizing this, we propose a method of selective
language modeling that targets the influential tokens, optimizing the learning process.

B.4
Scaling Laws

Scaling laws guide us in discovering the impact of factors such as parameter count, data size, and
compute on language model performance and behavior. These studies usually focus on predicable
scaling though power law [Kaplan et al., 2020, Hernandez et al., 2021], optimal resource allocation
[Hoffmann et al., 2022], downstream tasks [Wei et al., 2022b, Isik et al., 2024, Gadre et al., 2024],
architectures [Tay et al., 2022], memorization [Tirumala et al., 2022, Carlini et al., 2022, Henighan
et al., 2023, Biderman et al., 2024], and repeating data [Hernandez et al., 2022, Muennighoff et al.,
2024, Xue et al., 2024]. Most scaling laws on model performance study cross-entory loss on all
training tokens, while we focus on the tokens loss of desired distributions.

C
Limitations and Future Work

Generalizability
In math continual pretraining, as depicted in Figure 6, training exclusively with
SLM leads to quickly convergence to the domain focused by the reference model, accompanied by
a significant rise in the loss of unselected tokens. Although no adverse effects, like biases, have
been observed from the increased loss yet, a general pretraining loss on text and code may prevent
overfitting [Goodhart and Goodhart, 1984], as suggested by Ouyang et al. [2022] and Azerbayev
et al. [2023]. Furthermore, future efforts could broaden the corpus scope of the reference model, and
enlarge the pretraining data size, as exemplified by DeepSpeedMath [Shao et al., 2024].

Scalability
Due to budget constraints, we have only verified the effectiveness of our method on
smaller models (<=7B parameters) and smaller datasets (<100B tokens). Smaller models benefit
significantly from removing the loss of irrelevant tokens and focusing on important ones. However,
it’s possible that very large models trained on extensive corpora may naturally develop this inductive
bias to compress useful data (i.e., compressing everything), although it may sounds inefficient for
now. Therefore, future works should study whether this selective language modeling technique can
scale to very large models and data [Kaplan et al., 2020].

Is training a reference model necessary?
To score tokens, we need a high-quality reference
model. This could be a base model trained with a small amount of high-quality data, or a performant
open-source model. In fact, since we only need input logprobs or perplexity from reference model,
we could even utilize more powerful proprietary model APIs. We can input tokens and use the log
probabilities of the input returned by the API as reference scores. We leave this for future works.

How to improve upon SLM?
There are many natural extensions of SLM, e.g., reweighting tokens
instead of selecting may improve robustness; using a reference model as a reward model to guide
pretraining with reinforcement learning; adopting multiple reference models to reduce overfitting;
designing token-level curriculum learning and iterative strategies for continuous improvements, etc.

Expanding the use of SLM
SLM may be extended to supervised fine-tuning to address the noise
and distribution mismatches in many SFT datasets. Another potential application is alignment, e.g.,
by training a reference model to emphasize helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness, we may
obtain a base model that is natively aligned during the pretraining stage. Meanwhile, we believe
that the idea of SLM may find broader applications in multimodal data such as images, videos, and
speech, which have a high noise-to-information ratio than text.

linear fitting and took the difference in loss between the first and last points as evidence of whether
the loss decreased during the training process.

Specifically, suppose we have a sequence of token’s loss (l0, l1, ..., ln). Our goal is to minimize the
sum of the squares of the differences between each data point and its linear predictive value:

f(a, b) = minimize

n
X

i=0
(li −(axi + b))2,
(6)

where x0 = 0 is the initial checkpoint and xn = n is the final checkpoint. Substituting these into
the fitted equation, we can obtain the Loss values at the start and end after fitting: Lstart = b and
Lend = an + b. The change in loss can then be expressed as: ∆L = Lend −Lstart. Meanwhile, we
represent the average Loss of the last checkpoint as Lmean.

Next, we can classify the tokens based on ∆L and the Lmean. We categorize tokens with ∆L < −0.2
as H→L (loss decreases from high to low) category tokens, and tokens with ∆L > 0.2 as L→H (loss
increases from low to high) category tokens. If −0.2 ≤∆L ≤0.2 and ln ≤Lmean, then tokens are
classified as L→L (loss remains low); if ln > Lmean, they are classified as H→H (loss remains high).
In Figure 10, we have added the tokens’ loss curves of the 7B model which is consistent with the
other experimental settings in §2.1, for readers to refer to whether similar phenomena exist on larger
models. In Figure 11, we visualize examples of the four categories of tokens in actual text.

D.2
Non-Converging Tokens in Pretrainig

In §2.1, we mentioned that during the training process, only a minority of tokens belong to the H→L
category. Among the remaining categories of H→H and L→L tokens, there are tokens that exhibit
significant fluctuations during training. Furthermore, there are instances where H→L tokens are
not effectively learned. Therefore, in our analysis, we specifically select those tokens from these
categories that demonstrate considerable variability and distinct loss. We visualize these tokens
that exhibit abnormal behavior during the training process. As illustrated in Figure 12, we find that
the majority of these tokens originate from rather chaotic corpora. For instance, the corpora may
include a mix of custom symbols, unintelligible gibberish, and information such as timetables and
bibliographic references. Within a segment of normal text, there may also be fluctuations in the usage
of common conjunctions, word suffixes, and punctuation marks. The latter may not necessarily be
disastrous for training; in fact, it could represent a normal occurrence. However, if we can effectively
mitigate the losses caused by the former, it might lead to more stable and efficient model training.

Math Evalution

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model across various math reasoning benchmarks,
encompassing a range of difficulties from elementary to university level, multiple mathematical

domains, and diverse question types including multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Our
benchmarks include GSM8k [Cobbe et al., 2021], MATH [Hendrycks et al., 2021], GSM-Hard [Gao
et al., 2022], SVAMP [Patel et al., 2021], ASDIV [Miao et al., 2020], MAWPS [Koncel-Kedziorski
et al., 2016], TabMWP (TAB) [Lu et al., 2023], MathQA (MQA) [Amini et al., 2019], MMLU-STEM
[Hendrycks et al., 2020], and SAT [Azerbayev et al., 2023].

E.2
General Evalution

In the evaluation of general domain, we followed the lm-evaluation-harness [Gao et al., 2023] and
evalute model on MMLU [Hendrycks et al., 2020], BBH [Suzgun et al., 2022], AGIEval [Zhong
et al., 2023b], ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge [Clark et al., 2018], BoolQ [Clark et al., 2019],
PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020], Hellaswag [Zellers et al., 2019], WinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021],
OpenBookQA [Mihaylov et al., 2018]. On HumanEval [Zheng et al., 2023] and TydiQA [Clark et al.,
2020], we follow the evaluation pipeline of open-instrcut [Ivison et al., 2023] and report Pass@1 and
Pass@10 for HumanEval and F1 for TydiQA. For MBPP [Austin et al., 2021] benchmark, we follow
the evaluation pipeline of DeepSeek-Coder [Guo et al., 2024], and report Pass@1 and Pass@10.

F
Relate the Selected Tokens’ Loss to Downstream Task Performance

In this section, we declare the details about correlating the loss of selected tokens with the performance
of downstream tasks. Concurrent study has explored similar methods to study the impact of scaling
laws with the performance of models in downstream tasks [Gadre et al., 2024]. Our analysis
here differs in that it aims to elucidate the relationship between the decrease/increase in loss for
selected/unselected tokens and the model’s performance on downstream tasks.

We use the average accuracy of MATH and GSM8K as the standard for measuring downstream tasks
performance of model. Based on the trend of data points in Figure 7, we propose the relationship
between the average accuracy of downstream tasks and selected/unselected tokens’ loss,

Acc(L) = log(a ∗L + c)
(7)

The parameters a and c are fitted from the data. If the loss of selected tokens Ls is used for fitting,
then a > 0. Conversely, if the loss of unselected tokens Lus is used for fitting, then a < 0. Therefore,
we believe that training the model on selected tokens can effectively improve its performance on
downstream tasks, while unselected tokens may have a detrimental effect on the model’s performance
in downstream tasks.

G
Examples of Tokens Selected by SLM

G.1
Token Selected Examples

In Figure 13, we present several examples of tokens selected by the SLM method, with content
marked in blue indicating the tokens actually chosen during the pretraining process.

G.2
Dynamic Token Selected

In Figure 14, we display the dynamic changes in token selection tendencies throughout the SLM
training process. We chose four checkpoints during the training process (0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%)
to analyze the current tendencies in token selection. The preferences for token selection are indicated
by different colors, ranging from high to low preference, typically represented as deep blue, blue,
black, orange, and dark orange, respectively.

H
Self-Reference Setting

In this section, we will provide a detailed introduction to the reference loss score function and
information entropy score function in SLM. Reference loss score function is to directly use the loss
of the reference model as the basis for selecting tokens. The higher the token’s loss of the reference

model, the lower the expectation that the token will be selected. The score LRM(xi) can be directly
obtained by referring to Equation 1. Information entropy score function is to select the corresponding
token based on the information entropy of the reference model in each token. The information entropy
of token xi can be expressed as:

HRM(xi) = −

V
X

k=1
P(tk|x<i) log P(tk|x<i),
(8)

where tk represents the i-th token in the vocabulary, and V represents the size of the vocabulary. The
intuition of this strategy is that the higher the information entropy, the higher the uncertainty of the
token in the context. Therefore, we consider that if the language model is still uncertain for certain
tokens after pretraining, we do not hope that the language model to learn it during pretraining. In
Table 4, we provide more SLM results, including different select ratios and combinations of two
score functions, for the convenience of readers to refer to.

I
Weak-to-Strong Generalization

Apart from the main experiments where we use the same base model for the reference and continual
pretraining, we also investigate if a smaller reference model can effectively guide the pretraining of
a larger model. We use Tinyllama-1.1B as reference model and continual pretraining Llama-2-7B
on 15B OpenWebMath tokens. Results presented in Table 5 indicate that, despite the considerable

22


---Page Break---
gap between the small and large models [Li et al., 2023e], employing the small reference model to
token selection can still yield benefits to the pre-training of the larger model. If reference and training
models have different vocabularies, one can consider performing token alignment [Wan et al., 2024,
Fu et al., 2023], which we leave for future work.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the abstract and §1, we clearly demonstrate the contribution and scope of
this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix C, we have thoroughly discussed the limitations of our article,
hoping to guide more future work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

24


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In §2.1 and §2.2, we elaborated on the motivation and theoretical derivation of
our method, with a complete proof process in place.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided detailed descriptions of the experimental setup in §3.1 and
methods in §2.2 to ensure that our experiment can be reproduced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

25


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: This may be temporary, and we are working hard to promote the process of
open source.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In §3.1 and Appendix E, we clearly demonstrated various experimental settings,
including hyperparameters, model settings, training settings, evaluation settings, etc.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Due to the high cost of pre-training and the significant results obtained across
various settings, we do not repeat the same experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

26


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In §3.1, we have provided sufficient information on the computer resources
needed to reproduce the experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We guarantee that the research conducted in the paper complies with NeurIPS
Code of Ethics in all aspects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The purpose of this paper is to improve the training process of large language
models, without any negative societal impacts.

Guidelines:

27


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The creators or original owners of the assets used in the paper, such as code,
data, and models, have been appropriately recognized, and the licenses and terms of use
have been clearly mentioned and properly respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

28


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

before boiling down batery acid? anyways... There are some good videos on youtube that demonstrate how to
synthesize sulfuric acid using different methods. The drain cleaner you get from the store will be impure and may
contain organic matter that discolors the acid.

Token Selected Examples

• Process the student answer as a Math Object Formula, and break down its parse tree by its top-level operators.
The idea is to create an array of the student’s primitive factors, so say 3(x+1)(x+2)ˆ2 gives (3,x+1,x+2). • Because
we may want factoring over Z, checking the gcd of coefficients within each factor. • Pass each of these things to
SAGE and ask if the nonconstant factors are reducible over Z or Q. Also ask if they are monic. These things at
least we learned how to do at the Vancouver code camp. The end goal is to count the following forms as correct,
possibly controlled by flags: n \{}prod (factor)ˆpower, where each factor is irreducible in Z[X], n in Z r \{}prod
(factor)ˆpower, where each factor is irreducible and monic in Q[X], r in Q I suppose on the last one the monic
requirement could be dropped with a flag. I have no plans to check that the form is fully condensed, e.g. forcing
(x+1)ˆ2 and rejecting (x+1)(1+x)
The equation of the path traversed by a projectile is called equation of trajectory. \n \n Suppose, the body reaches
the point P after time ( t ) . \n \n Horizontal motion has no acceleration. Thus, using kinematic equation, horizontal
distance covered will be – \n \n x = u \cos \theta t \n \n Or, \quad t = ( \frac { x }{ u \cos \theta } ) \n \n Vertical
motion has constant acceleration ( g ) . Thus, distance covered will be – \n \n y = ( u \sin \theta ) t - \left ( \frac
{1}{2} \right ) g tˆ2 \n \n = ( u \sin \theta ) \left ( \frac {x}{u \cos \theta} \right ) - \left ( \frac {1}{2} \right ) g \left (

\frac {x}{u \cos \theta} \right )ˆ2 \n \n = \left ( \tan \theta \right ) x - \left ( \frac {g}{2 uˆ2 \cosˆ2 \theta} \right ) xˆ2
\n \n In this equation, ( \theta, \ u \ \text {and} \ g ) are constants. Thus, \n \n 1. Term \left ( \tan \theta \right ) is a
constant, let it is ( p ) \n 2. Term \left [ \left ( \frac {g}{2 uˆ2 \cosˆ2 \theta} \right ) \right ] is also a constant, let it is
( q ) \n \n So, \quad y = p x - q xˆ2 \n \n Therefore, ( y \propto xˆ2 ) , which is a required condition of a parabola.
The trajectory of the projectile is a parabola. \n \n ### Time of Maximum height \n \n As the body is projected it
goes up. Vertical component of velocity ( u \sin \theta ) gradually diminishes and becomes zero at the maximum
height of flight. After that, body starts moving downwards. \n \n Let, ( t_m ) is the time to reach at maximum
height ( h_m ) of flight. \n \n Therefore, from kinematic equation, we have – \n \n 0 = u \sin \theta - g t_m \n \n Or,
\quad t_m = \left ( \frac {u \sin \theta}{g} \right ) \n \n ### Time of Flight \n \n Total time taken by the projectile
between the instant it is projected and till it reaches at a point in the horizontal plane of its projection is called Time
of flight. \n \n Let, the body reaches at point B on ground after time ( T_f ) of projection. Then – \n \n Net vertical
displacement covered during the time of flight is zero. Using kinematic equation of motion, we get – \n \n 0 = ( u
\sin \theta ) T_f - \left ( \frac {1}{2} \right ) g \ ( T_f )ˆ2 \n \n Or, \quad T_f = \left ( \frac {2 u \sin \theta}{g} \right
) = 2 \left ( \frac {u \sin \theta}{g} \right ) \n \n = 2 t_m \n \n Thus, \quad \text {Total time of flight} = \text {Time
of ascent} + \text {Time of descent} \n \n = 2 \times \text {Time of maximum height.} \n \n ### Maximum height
of Flight \n \n It is the maximum height reached by a projectile. It is denoted by ( h_m ) \n \n At the highest point
of flight, the vertical component of velocity becomes zero. \n \n From kinematic equation of motion, we have – \n
\n vˆ2 = uˆ2 + 2 a s \n \n Therefore, \quad 0ˆ2 - ( u \sin \theta )ˆ2 = 2 ( - g ) h_m \n \n Or, \quad h_m = \left ( \frac
{uˆ2 \sinˆ2 \theta}{2 g} \right )

We identify two equations having the same solution with the equivalence relation: \n \n $(a,b) \sim (c,d) \mbox{ if
and only if } ad = bc$ \n \n To show that this is an equivalence relation: \n \n 1. Reflexivity: $$(a,b) \sim (a,b)$$ if
and only if $$ab = ba$$ which is true. Hence it is reflexive. \n 2. Symmetry: $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ if and only if
$$ad = bc$$ if and only if $$bc = ad$$ if and only if $$(c,d) \sim (a,b)$$. Hence it is symmetric. \n 3. Transitivity:
$$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ and $$(c,d) \sim (e,f)$$ if and only if $$ad = bc$$ and $$cf = de$$. Multiplying these equations
together, we get $$adcf = bcde$$. We can cancel $$d$$ and $$c$$ from both sides to get $$af = be$$. Hence
$$(a,b) \sim (e,f)$$. \n \n Hence, we have successfully formed the set of rational numbers when we factor out
the equivalence classes! \n \n $\mathbb{Q} = \frac{\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}}{\sim}$ \n
\n Let’s now take a look at what members of $$\mathbb{Q}$$ look like, say for the equation $$2x = 3$$. This
equation is represented by the ordered pair
If the light moves in a purely radial direction, we can describe its path by the coordinate functions $$t(\lambda)$$ and
$$r(\lambda)$$. The equation of motion $$dsˆ2 =0$$ then takes the form $$g_{tt} \left(\frac{dt}{d\lambda}\right)ˆ2
+ g_{rr} \left(\frac{dr}{d\lambda}\right)ˆ2 = 0,$$ which we can rewrite as $$\left(\frac{dt}{dr}\right)ˆ2 = -
\frac{g_{rr}}{g_{tt}}.$$ \n \n The length of the rod is then $$L = c \int_{r_1}ˆ{r_2} \frac{dt}{dr} \text{ d}r = c
\int_{r_1}ˆ{r_2} \sqrt{-\frac{g_{rr}}{g_{tt}}} \text{ d}r,$$ where I have taken the positive square root because
$$r_2 > r_1$$. \n \n Notice that the length is independent of the signature of the metric, so whether you work with
the (-+++) or (+—) metric is purely conventional and will not change the physics. \n \n For the Schwarzschild
metric, we obtain explicitly $$L = r_2 - r_1 + r_s \ln\left(\frac{r_2 - r_s}{r_1 - r_s}\right) > r_2 - r_1.$$ \n \n Now
what happens if you magically, instantaneously increase the mass of the black hole? I think the length $$L$$ of the
rod stays the same (I’m here assuming that the rod is infinitely stiff), but that it would now ”appear shorter” to the
distant observer - i.e. it would no longer occupy the entire space between $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$.

#8de97 \n \n Dec 10, 2016 \n \n That is not an identity. \n \n #### Explanation: \n \n Recall that \n \n ${\cot}ˆ{2}
x + 1 = {\csc}ˆ{2} x$. \n \n So, we can write \n \n $\frac{1 - {\csc}ˆ{2} x}{\csc} ˆ 2 x = \frac{1 - \left({\cot}ˆ{2} x
+ 1\right)}{\csc} ˆ 2 x$ \n \n $= {\cot}ˆ{2} \frac{x}{\csc} ˆ 2 x$ \n \n Recall also that $\cot x = \cos \frac{x}{\sin}

x$ and $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin} x$. \n \n This allows us to continue \n \n $= \frac{{\cos}ˆ{2} \frac{x}{\sin} ˆ 2
x}{\frac{1}{\sin} ˆ 2 x}$ \n \n $= {\cos}ˆ{2} \frac{x}{\sin} ˆ 2 x \cdot {\sin}ˆ{2} \frac{x}{1}$ \n \n $= {\cos}ˆ{2}
x$ \n \n Which is not identically $\cos x$. \n \n (${\cos}ˆ{2} x = \cos x$ only when $\cos x = 1$ or $0$) \n \n Dec
10, 2016 \n \n No. It is equal to ${\sin}ˆ{2} x - 1$. \n \n #### Explanation: \n \n If we have $\frac{1 - x}{x}$, we

can write it as $\frac{1}{x} - \frac{x}{x}$. \n \n The same way, $\frac{1 - {\csc}ˆ{2} x}{\csc} ˆ 2$ can be written
as $\frac{1}{\csc} ˆ 2 x - \frac{{\csc}ˆ{2} x}{{\csc}ˆ{2} x}$. \n \n This is equal to ${\sin}ˆ{2} x - 1$. SMS scnews

Figure 14: An example of dynamic token selection changes during the training process, which
illustrated with five different score levels represented by deep blue, light blue, black, light orange,
and dark orange. The bluer the color indicates a higher tendency for the token to be selected, while
the more orange the color suggests a lower tendency for the token to be selected.
