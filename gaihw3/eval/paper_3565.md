Abstract

Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for
clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-
aided diagnosis model for histopathology WSIs, previous methods typically em-
ploy Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level
labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise in-
teractions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual
information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this
issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs,
methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs Nyströmformer as
an approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal
performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute
positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies
in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature
of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI
modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved
by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows
that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the
Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during
chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity
to linear with a small local bandwidth. Additionally, this locality helps the model
generalize to unseen or under-fitted positions more easily. Building on this, we
propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and
local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual
MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks
to validate its superiority in: 1) overall performance, 2) memory usage and speed,
and 3) extrapolation ability compared to previous methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.

Introduction

Though digital pathology images have been widely used for Cancer diagnosis [50, 65, 89, 94, 17, 44]
and prognosis [9, 12, 71] and gene expression [82] via automatic computer-assisted analysis, the
Giga-pixels of resolution, as large as 150, 000 × 150, 000 pixels [50, 12, 60] of Whole Slide Image
(WSI), still poses great challenges on both annotation labelling and efficient computation for model
training [42]. Thus, previous methods [9, 12, 42, 5, 40, 92, 93, 41] focus on developing annotation-

& computational- efficient learning to cope with those problems by employing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) [51, 32] with only WSI-level supervision.

Currently, there are mainly three steps (or mainstream genres) of WSI analysis framework: 1) access
better instance-level patch embedding via Self-supervised Learning [30, 7, 9, 40, 77].

Figure 1: Handling an extremely long se-
quence with a magnification of 20× (or qua-
drupling to 40×) poses a significant challenge.
The computational complexity of transform-
ers, denoted as O(n2), becomes prohibitive
in such cases, leading to computational explo-
sion.

2) design WSI head architectures [50, 65, 89] and
train the head with frozen instance embedding. 3)
fine-tune patch embedding with WSI level weak la-
bel for better task-specific results [90, 42]. Here
in this paper, we focus on the step-2 and uncover-
ing that there are still some room for improvement:
Firstly, the vanilla attention used in AB-MIL, DS-
MIL, CLAM, etc. [32, 40, 50, 89], despite its com-
putational efficiency (compared to self-attention), is
unable to model contextual or interaction informa-
tion across instances within a WSI. These interac-
tions, which play a crucial role in prediction decision-
making [11, 65] indeed, can be modelled via self-
attention mechanism. However, the long sequence of
WSI instances pose O(n2) computation complexity
with self-attention (Fig. 1). Although this complex-
ity can be alleviated by self-attention approximation
methods like Nyströmformer [83, 75] used in Trans-
MIL [65], this approximation only get sub-optimal
performance compared to self-attention as pointed out in [20, 29]. Authors in HIPT [9] mitigates the
complexity by non-overlap large region slicing, but the interactions of instances from different region
slicing are highly ignored (e.g. adjacent patches may be separated into two regions).

The above issues highlight a strong need for an effective and efficient Transformer for WSI modelling.
To begin, we discuss the performance bottleneck of basic Transformer [72] for WSI. Different to
Vision Transformer [23] for natural image modelling where the number of patched tokens are smaller
than patch embedding size (e.g. ViT-Small-p16 with embedding size 384 attend on 196+1 tokens),
the Transformer-based WSI model suffers severe low-rank bottleneck of attention matrix [3, 22]
given the long-sequence (n >> 1024) of WSI but limited embedding size (d ≤1024). We reveal
this problem in WSI theoretically, thus finding that one self-attention layer with limited embedding
size can not model local contexts and global interactions at the same time. By stacking multiple
self-attention layers, we notice that the low layer focus more on local context (Fig. 2a) after training
while high layer focus on global. However, the rank of the attention matrix is still limited (Fig. 2a+d),
resulting in constrained performance.

We assert that the low-rank bottleneck causes the attention mechanism to become confused between
local and global interactions, even after training. In other words, using Q and K⊤with only 2dn
points, it’s hard to model n × n interactions comprehensively in the context of WSI where n >> d.
We believe that it would be better focusing on less interactions in one layer. Motivated by the low
layers of Transformer showing highly sparse attention pattern (Fig. 2a+d) with locality, we propose a
local attention mask to learn local interaction more directly. This local mask, more importantly, can
highly improve the rank of the attention matrix, showing better representation ability. Furthermore,
the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the
quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. In addition, this locality
helps the model generalize to unseen or under-fitted positions more easily (where absolute position
embedding used in methods like TransMIL may fail, see Appendix A.2 for more illustration).

Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration
and local-global information modelling.

Our main contributions can be summarized as 3 folds:

1) We firstly theoretically uncover why Transformer model for WSI-MIL analysis fails, based
on the low-rank bottleneck of attention matrix for long sequence but limited embedding size.
We then further analyze the sparsity and locality pattern of attention matrix empirically to
hint our local attention design.

2) We convert the full self-attention into local attention which shows three advantages: higher
rank for better representation ability, lighter computational complexity and extrapolation
ability for shape-vary WSIs. We further combine the full self-attention for global long-range
dependency after stacking layers of local attention.

3) Our WSI-analysis experiments are performed on both diagnosis and prognosis tasks on 4
WSI datasets including Breast, Stomach, Colon and Rectal Carcinoma, which show strong
universality of the method and practical potential for real-world applications.

Multiple Instance Learning for WSI Analysis

Whole Slide Images (WSIs) contain a rich set of visual information that can aid in pathological
analysis [6, 50]. However, accurate annotation of cell-level information within WSIs is labor-intensive
and time-consuming [6, 50, 9]. To address this issue, weakly-supervised methods have gained
popularity in pathology WSI analysis. Attention-based Multi-Instance Learning (AB-MIL) [32] is
adopted to learns instance adaptive weights, allowing the model to focus on informative regions

---Page Break---
within the WSIs. This approach significantly reduces the annotation burden of pathologists while
still providing valuable insights for patient-level diagnosis. In the context of weakly-supervised
pathology WSI analysis, several innovative approaches, DS-MIL, CLAM, DTFD, etc. [32, 40, 50, 89,
35, 61, 18, 2] have been proposed. However, their utilized vanilla attention with light computational
cost can not model WSI contextual information, which is useful in pathologist diagnosis decision
making [11, 65]. The fine-grained details and global contextual information can also be captured
by multi-scale modelling [9, 40]. Graph Network [11, 43, 28, 8, 25] is also useful to make model
be context-aware. Similar to this, HIPT [9] and TransMIL [65] have explored the advantages of
Transformer with pairwise interactions to model this contextual information. Since Transformer can
be generalized to Graph Network [24], both modelling the pairwise interaction, in this paper we focus
more on Transformer and try to adapt it better to fit the shape varying and long context properties
of WSI. Unlike the authors in [80] who focus on the low-rank properties of pathology images, we
investigate from the perspective of low-rank in the attention matrix of Transformer.

2.2
Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence

The primary goal of this area is to alleviate the computation and memory complexity of self-attention
mechanism on long sequence input. A lot of modifications sparsify the attention matrix [59, 15, 1]
with some fixed patterns. Extend to this, some work [73, 74, 64] using learnable patterns in a data-
driven fashion, e.g. Reformer [38] introduces a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster
tokens into chunks. Linformer [75] technique leverage low-rank approximations of the self-attention
matrix, decomposing the N × N matrix to N × k. The kernels also serve as an approximation
of the attention matrix, including Performers [37], Linear Transformers [16]. Another popular
method of reducing computation cost is to reduce the resolution of the sequence, hence reducing
computation cost by a commensurate factor, e.g. Perceiver [33], Swin Transformer [47]. The recent
Nyströmformer [83] used in TransMIL [65], can also be seem as kernel-based low-rank approach.
Above work mainly focus on a light approximation of self-attention or using sparse attention, which
is indeed worse than the full attention [20]. Recent work like FlashAttention [20] and others [62, 34]
using chunked computation scheme and IO-aware mechanism to be memory-efficient and gain full
ability like self-attention. Another lines of work try to merge RNN and Transformer, e.g. Transformer-
XL [19] proposed a segment-level recurrence mechanism that connects multiple segments and blocks,
and now is widely used in most successful LLMs [52, 91, 69]. Recently, linear RNNs [88, 54, 53, 27]
and its variants [21, 57] are also proposed, but these recurrent ability is designed for 1-d sequence
with causal or auto-regressive property, not fit well for image recognition. To fit longer sequence,
better positional embeddings like RoPE, ALiBi, etc. [66, 58, 14] are also proposed. Different to these
work focus on NLP task, here in this paper we try to build an efficient Transformer for WSI analysis,
which is a unique challenge in vision task.

3.1
Preliminary: Attention-based WSI Analysis

Given a WSI X as input, the goal is to make slide-level prediction ˆY by learning a classifier f(X; θ).
X is firstly patched into a long sequence of small instances X = {x1, ..., xn} because of its extremely
large resolution, where n is the number of instance. The slide-level supervision Y is given by doctors
who consider the latent label yi of all instance xi. Most previous work [6, 50, 9] try to model this
process by a Max-pooling operation, so initially, this annotation process is treated as:

Y = max{y1, ..., yn}.
(1)

Since the end-to-end training from raw image input to WSI-level output is infeasible because of large
memory cost, conventional approaches convert it into two separate stages: Firstly, convert all small
patches into instance embeddings Z = {z1, ..., zn} by a pre-trained backbone such as ResNet [31] or
ViT [79], which refers to general features from public ImageNet, or learned on the related dataset to
extract the domain-specific representations [9, 36]. Then, aggregate all patches’ features within a
slide and producing the slide-level prediction ˆY = g(Z; θ). In this paper, we mainly focus on the
latter one, where g is an vanilla attention function followed by a linear classifier head as:

ˆY = σ(

n
X

i=1
aizi),
(2)

---Page Break---
where ai is attention weights and σ(·) is a linear head.

However, above vanilla attention method assigning adaptive weight to each instance to make simple
summation or pooling can not model the interactions among different instances. Thus, to handle
this problem, Transformer with self-attention is employed in TransMIL [65] and HIPT [9], where
the attention sublayer computes the attention scores for the i-th query qi ∈R1×d, (1 ≤i ≤n) in
each head, where d is the head dimension. In other words, each instance will compute an attention
score list as interactions with all instances. These attention scores are then multiplied by the values to
return the output of the attention sub-layer as:

oi = softmax(qiK⊤)V,
(3)

where the {Q : qi, K : ki, V : vi} ∈Rn×d are obtained through linear transform from the input
embedding Z, the softmax(qiK⊤) is the attention score and O ∈Rn×d is the output. Given O,
which encodes the interactions among instances, we can further use Equation (2) and input O to
replace Z for final prediction, mean-pooling and class token in ViT [79] can also be adopted. Note
that here we omit dropout, FFN, residual connection and some detailed blocks in Transformer for
simplicity.

Positional Embedding: Since the operation in Equation (3) is position-agnostic, Transformer [72,
23] try to model contextual interactions by incorporate position information. Absolute positional
embedding assigns a positional vector pm to each position m and adds it to the embedding vector
as: zi = zi + pm,i. In HIPT [9] , the absolute positional embedding [23] for 2-d is employed, while
TransMIL [65] use convolutions as implicit positional embedding [78] but treat data as 1-d sequence.
Relative positional embedding that model the positional difference m−n has become popular. Rotary
positional embedding (RoPE) [66] encodes the position with rotations: f(qm, m) = Rmqm, where
Rm is a rotation matrix with angles proportional to m. With the rotation’s property, the query-key
product exhibits a positional difference:

f(qm, m)f(kn, n)⊤= qmRn−mk⊤
n .
(4)

The core idea of RoPE is to insert position m, n signal on q, k and reflect the relative position on
the newly attention matrix. Though the RoPE is designed for 1-d language sequence, it can also be
extended to 2-d paradigm for application on WSI analysis [56].

Computational Complexity: Though above Transformer with self-attention can well model the
interactions among instances, its computational cost O(n2d) is too heavy for long sequence of
WSI due to the interactive attention score calculation (see Appendix A.5.5 for 40x magnification
WSI modelling). Previous WSI Transformer SOTA like TransMIL [65] and HIPT [9] relieve this
problem with different ways: 1) attention approximation: TransMIL [65] utilizes Nyströmformer [83],
a mechanism employs kernel-based low-rank approximation to approximate full self-attention for
acceleration. 2) region slicing: HIPT [9] utilizes the locality of image by slicing WSI into 4096×4096
squares without overlapping. Given the fixed window size, in each square there are fixed 16∗16 = 256
patches with shape of 256 × 256, thus the computational cost can also be seen as linear complexity.

3.2
Low-rank and Sparsity of Attention Matrix for Long-sequence WSI

Low-rank bottleneck:
Considering all queries in {Q : qi}, the Equation (3) can be seen as:

O = softmax(QK⊤)V,
(5)

where the rank of QK⊤can be derived as:

r(Qn×d(K⊤)d×n) ≤min(r(Qn×d), r(Kn×d)) = min(n, d).
(6)

In the context of WSI analysis, the patched sequence length n of most WSIs is larger than 1024
(Fig. 1), while the embedding size d of the pre-trained patch encoder is less than 1024 (e.g. 1024
in ResNet-50, 384 in ViT-Small, 768 in ViT-Base). Thus, in Equation 6, we have d ≤1024 ≤n,
indicating that the rank of the attention matrix in Transformer-based WSI analysis is constrained by
the embedding size d:
r(QK⊤) ≤min(n, d) = d.
(7)
As a result, the representation ability of self-attention is limited by the low-rank bottleneck, thus
vanilla Transformer based model in WSI analysis suffers sub-optimal performance. Though the

5


---Page Break---
non-linear softmax operation can change the rank, but we still observe limited rank of softmax(QK⊤)
after training (Fig. 2a+d). This is an extremely different problem compared to ViT modelling, e.g.
ViT-Small with embedding size of 384 only need to focus on 196 patch tokens (with image size of 224
and patch size of 16), which can model both local contextual and global interactions simultaneously
with full-rank attention matrix. We contend that, under this circumstance, Transformer for WSI
modelling may become confused when handling local contextual and global interactions with a single
layer.

Under this assumption, it is also more easy to understand the limitation of previous SOTA transformer
for WSI: TransMIL [65] with Nyströmformer [83] employs kernel-based low-rank approximation
to approximate full self-attention. However, it is worth noting that the approximation may produce
lower rank of attention matrix compared to basic self-attention, thus resulting lower performance
in TransMIL. Similar problems also happens in other models like softmax-free linear attention
[54, 67, 85]. We show a lot of experiment of these linear attention model in Appendix A.5.6.

An intuitive modification to handle the low-rank problem is to set a larger embedding size d, but this
makes computational complexity O(n2d) more severe, let alone most pathology patch pre-trained
foundation models [36, 49, 10] carry fixed embedding size. Noting that it is infeasible to fully
represent a matrix with a shape of n × n if n >> d given totally 2nd feature points from Qn×d and
Kn×d, why not focus the attention to more important interactions? Thus in the contrast, we alleviate
the low-rank bottleneck together with the problem of computational cost by focusing on locality,
motivated by the sparse and local pattern in low layers of attention (Fig. 2a).

Sparsity with locality:
Here we define the the selection index for retained sparse attention matrix
when the softmax probability is greater than a threshold:

I = where{softmax(QK⊤) > τ},
(8)

where the threshold τ is normalized by sequence number n, e.g. τ = 0.0001/n. Then, the sparsity
ratio can be denoted as:

r = 1 −len(I)

n2
.
(9)

We note that there is an obvious sparsity and local pattern in lower Transformer layers (Fig. 2a)
under this protocol. Given the learned locality and sparsity, we introduce to learn local contextual
information with a addable local attention mask for A = softmax(QK⊤) (without loss of generality,
here we mainly derive on 1-d sequence for simplicity):

maski,j =
−inf
if |i −j| > b,
0
otherwise,
(10)

where b is the local band width. Then the attention matrix is converted as:

Ai,j = softmax(QK⊤+ mask) =
0
if |i −j| > b,
p
otherwise,
(11)

where 0 < p < 1 is the softmax probability.

We claim that our proposed sparse local attention capture both higher rank and reduced computational
complexity, which will work better for WSI modelling:

1) Higher rank: It is easy to prove that the band matrix A in Equation 11 is of a lower-bound of rank
as n −b. Here we give a intuitive verification with a small band matrix:

A<n=9,b=3> =

(13)

which is apparently a upper triangular matrix with a full rank of n −b. Thus, we have:
rank(A) ≥rank(Asub) = n −b.
(14)
Since n > 1024 >> b practically, our model with higher rank carry stronger representation ability
which can focus more on local contextual information.

2) Reduced computational complexity: Given a larger n but fixed small b in Equation 12, there will
be a lot of zeros in upper-right and lower-left areas. We note that these zeros can be omitted during
attention matrix calculation by a chunking method [20]. Since most operations in softmax(QK⊤) can
be skipped, the modified complexity O(bnd) will linearly related to sequence length and band-width,
which is heavily reduced compared to O(n2d).

3) Extrapolation ability: Despite above advantages, here we further show that our model can
tackle WSIs with varying input shape better, in other words, extrapolation ability. RoPE need to be
well trained or fine-tuned on unseen or seldom seen longer length [45, 13, 81]. Another strategy
Attention with Linear Bias (ALiBi) adds pre-defined bias term after the query-key dot-product
attention matrix before softmax. For the original 1-d ALiBi [58], the bias is a static, non-learned
matrix softmax(qik⊤
j −ρ |i −j| computed by the distance between tokens from different positions.
We also introduce 2-d ALiBi by 2-d Euclidean distance among token positions, and we find that it
shows similar pattern (Appendix A.3) compared to our 2-d local attention but it needs to focus on all
instances.

LongMIL framework and implementation

To realize long contextual MIL modelling and better WSI analysis performance, the overall framework
(as depicted in Fig. 3) of our method includes 3 stages:

1) Segment and patch WSI into instances, then save its corresponding foreground patch feature
embedding and 2-d positions for preparation.

2) Calculate the local self-attention matrix by the local window mask given position distance.
This process is finished by trunk method like FlashAttention [20] to omit non-masking areas.

3) After multi layers (two as default) of local attention focusing on local contextual information
interactions, a pooling function with window size 2 × 2 is employed to reduce token number
by 4 times. Then a basic self-attention focus on global interactions is computed to get final
feature and prediction.

Pre-training Patch Encoders. Our work mainly focus on the WSI-head results based on some
good pre-trained encoders for histopathology including HIPT [9], Lunit [36] and newly foundation
models like UNI [10] and GigaPath [84]. We also include ResNet-50 pretrained in ImangeNet-1k
and ViT-small pretrained in BRACS patch data by ourself with DINO [7].

Implementation Details. We train our model with PyTorch on a RTX-3090 GPU, with a WSI-level
batchsize of 1, learning rate of 1e-4, and weight decay of 1e-2. We add positional encoding into the
framework, please check our code for details.

Slide-level Tumor Subtyping

Evaluation Metrics. For all the experiments, we report the macro-AUC and macro-F1 scores since
all these dataset suffering class imbalance. For TCGA-BRCA, we perform 10-fold cross-validation
with the same data split adopted in HIPT [9]. Besides, the dataset BRACS is officially split into
training, validation and testing, thus the experiment is conducted 5-times with different random
seeds. The mean and standard variance values of performance metrics are reported for multi-runs or
cross-validation runs.

Baselines for Comparison. We first show the results of Mean-/Max- pooling and KNN for traditional
evaluation. Then we directly evaluate several classical WSI-MIL methods, including AB-MIL [32],

DS-MIL [40], CLAM [50], DTFD-MIL [89]. Then we compare our method with Full Attention
(RoFormer) and TransMIL [65]. We omit HIPT [9] for BRACS since it need WSI larger than a
threshold and should based on their pre-trained backbone.

Results Analysis: For BRACS 3-categories tumor subtyping, the results are reported in Table 1. We
can first observe that both Full Attention and our LongMIL show improvement respectively. For
Full Attention, attributing to its full self-attention for pairwise interaction ability, it shows better
performance compared to all vanilla attention modules [32, 40, 50] and especially TransMIL [65]
which use attention approximation, but it is not quite stable to beat DTFD [89].

For TCGA-BRCA 2-categories tumor subtyping, we show the results in the Appendix A.5.1.

Evaluation Metrics. For all the experiments, C-Index scores are reported for the 3 datasets. We
follow the data splits and pre-trained patch embedding provided in HIPT [9] for fair comparison.
The performance results are also reported via the mean and standard variance values of performance
metrics by multiple folder cross-validation with the same running setting to HIPT [9].

Baselines for Comparison. For this task, we use the survival cross-entropy loss proposed by Zadeh et
al. [87]. The results are summarized in Table 2, where we directly evaluate several survival prediction
WSI-MIL methods, including AB-MIL [32], AMISL [86], DS-MIL [40], GCN-MIL [43]. Then
we compare our method with some state-of-the-art combining position embedding on Transformer:
TransMIL [65] and HIPT [9]. Though our method show some improvement, the C-index score is still
too low to daily clinical usage depending on only WSI information. In the near future, we would
like to investigate more on this task, e.g. combining multi-modality features as used in [12], since
Transformer also born with great ability on multi-modality fusion [39, 70, 12, 63].

4.3
Evaluation on Pathology Foundation Models

Since recent Pathology Foundation Model (PathFMs) [10, 48, 84] have been emerging as strong
patch encoders, we here further provide evaluations based on PathFMS including UNI [10] and
GigaPath [84]. The pre-processing procedure is the same to previous sections. Since the WSI params
are pre-trained in GigaPath, we also experiment it using random initialization for fair comparison.
For the mismatch of UNI patch encoder and GigaPath WSI head, we add a nn.Linear layer as a
feature projector. The results is shown in Table 3, we find that our method also show consistency
improvement with PathFMs. Furthermore, we find that the pre-training plays a key role to the success
of Prov-GigaPath WSI-head, since transformers are much more over-parameterized than previous
simple attention-based MIL. However, the WSI-level pretrained model relies on patch encoder (e.g.
UNI patch encoder + GigaPath WSI do not show competing result). We also provide more difference
analysis of efficient attention mechanism compared to GigaPath WSI head in Appendix A.6. In table
4, we also include survival prediction based on PathFMs.

Further Experiments and Ablations

We also provide abundant ablations in Appendix A.5.3 to select best setting including: Transformer
blocks and multi-head number, dropout ratio, weight decay, learning rate and the local window size.
For linear attention result, please check Appendix A.5.6 with main findings that the linear attentions
show low performance like TransMIL since it get low-rank problem more easily. For linear RNN
method like Mamba, the result is also relatively lower than Transformer since 2-d WSIs do not hold
causal property like 1-d data. For extrapolation validation, please check Appendix A.2 where our
method show significant performance improvement (p-value ≈0.1). We also find that our method
show consistency improvement when equipped on different magnification (e.g. 40x) and patch size
(224 -> 448) as shown in Appendix A.5.4.

Conclusions and Limitations

In conclusion, our work introduces advancements in computer-aided diagnosis for histopathology
WSI analysis. By analyze the low-rank bottleneck and sparsity property and proposing a local-global
hybrid Transformer model, our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), demonstrates superior
performance in handling large and shape-varying WSIs. The evaluations across various tasks highlight
its accuracy, extrapolation ability, and efficiency compared to previous methods. Our contributions
enhance WSI analysis and provide valuable insights for future research. The LongMIL has two
limitations: First, its application is restricted to very large image via Transformer modelling. Second,
limited embedding size is adopted for practical aim and fair comparison, which is the key to stronger
performance based on the low-rank assumption. Future work will aim to address these limitations.

Appendix

A.1
Why linear complexity is important

We find that FlashAttention [20] using memory-efficient trucking and hardware IO-aware opera-
tions is good enough in both memory and speed to cope with 20x magnification (about twice slower)
WSI model (as a result we use Full Attention as the last global attention layer of our hybrid Long-
MIL model for 20x magnification, we also provide a replacement version using linear attention
as last layer as shown in Table 9 signed as LongMIL+V-Mamba). However it is unacceptable in
dealing with 40x magnification (about 30-times slower in BRACS), which takes us 2 days or more
to train 5-fold runs models on BRACS, and it takes longer if stacking more layers and on larger
WSI with more rounds (e.g.average over 50000 instances of TCGA-BRCA dataset with double
WSI num and traditionally using 10 fold-cross validation). This hinders the improvement of 40x
magnification ( which includes more useful details) for both development and deployment. Thus we
use LongMIL+V-Mamba (hybrid transformer as local+local+linear global attention) in 40x and also
get a strong performance as shown in Table 7 left-column, which is faster in speed and comparable in
performance compared to FlashAttention.

A.2
Extrapolation: Train small but test large

We first split BRACS dataset into training (small images) and validation+testing (large image) by
sorting them via instance number and then use train-val-test ratio as 6:2:2. The experimental results
are plot in lower-right area of Fig. 4.

A.3
HIPT Region Slicing, Local-mask Matrix and 2-d ALiBi

In Fig. 5, we show the difference and similarity between HIPT region slicing, local-mask matrix and
2-d ALiBi, where our local mask can be seen as a generalization of HIPT and 2-d ALiBi.

A.4
Details of Datasets

For the slide-level tumor subtyping performance, our method is evaluated on two datasets:

BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) [4] collect H&E stained Histology Images, containing 547
WSIs for three lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into
seven categories. Here, since the WSIs number is limited, we only perform three class subtyping. The
WSIs are segmented in 20× magnification and non-overlapping patching with 224 × 224 size. The
Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) [68, 55] is a public dataset for breast invasive
carcinoma cohort for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma versus Invasive Lobular Carcinoma subtyping. The
WSIs are segmented into non-overlapping tissue-containing patches with a size of 256 × 256 (keep
consistency to previous work [9]) at 20× magnification patches were curated from 1038 WSIs. For
the slide-level survival prediction, despite TCGA-BRCA, we further includes 2 TCGA histology
datasets: 1) A combination dataset of the Colon adenocarcinoma and Rectum adenocarcinoma
Esophageal carcinoma (TCGA-COADREAD), which includes 316 WSIs as used in HIPT [9]. 2)
Stomach adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) dataset including 321 WSIs. For pre-processing, we using
the implementation of CLAM [50] which mainly includes HSV, Blur, Thresholding, and Contours
methods to localize the tissue regions in each WSI.

A.5
Further Experiments and Ablations

A.5.1
TCGA-BRCA 2-categories tumor subtyping

The results are reported in Table 5 and right column of Table 6. We could observe a significant
improvement in our method when using HIPT pre-trained patch embeddings, but only a slight
improvement with Lunit. This could be because this task reaches an upper bound with the high-
quality Lunit embeddings. Given that it only predicts binary categories, even simple max-pooling can
outperform almost all previous MIL methods.

lower left: The 2-d position index of WSI foreground patches mainly scattered within index<100,
thus area enclosed by the dashedline suffers under-fitting with previous method. lower right:
TransMIL and full self-attention (FSA) get a relatively low performance during testing on unseen
larger WSI. Assisted by our method, this case show significant performance improvement (p-value

Figure 5: Difference and similarity between various methods. upper left: HIPT slicing with
extremely hard pattern, upper right: our proposed local mask, lower left: 2-d ALiBi, or 2-d Euclid
distance, lower right: attention mask of Prov-GigaPath from their paper (their causal attention,
only focus on lower triangular matrix, may be a drawing problem). Apparently the local mask of
Prov-GigaPath mainly focus on 1-d interactions (weigh x-axis of WSI more than y-axis), e.g. the
interactions when distance less than 2.0 are almost missed, as depicted in the red text areas of the
lower-left 2-d Euclid distance subfigure. We have checked their code implementation, which directly
apply 1-d LongNet to the serialized (via z-scan) patch sequence.

Hyper-parameters of Transformer training

Number of Transformer blocks and multi-head, bias slope coefficient and local window size, weight
decay and dropout ratio: Here we include following hyper-parameters for our results on BRACS with
ViT-S patch embedding pre-trained by [36]: Transformer blocks and multi-head number, dropout
ratio, weight decay, and learning rate, finally the local window size. Due to time-consumption, we
fixed other hyper-parameters when ablation on selected variant (The default setting is Transformer
local blocks number = 2, multi-head number = 1, dropout ratio = 0.0, weight decay = 1e-2, and
learning rate = 1e-4, local-window size = 10 (radius)), the details can be found in Fig. 6.

A.5.4
Multi-scale and magnification

There are large differences in speed and performance for 20x and 40x magnification, since FlashAt-
tention [20] will be quite slow if given over 20k instances compared to linear attention our local
attention. For performance and speed please check Table 7 and Fig. 7b, respectively.

We also experiment on larger patch size (from 224 to 448, Table 8) to decrease the overall token
number, but find that our method still shows stronger performance.

1. Simple attentions (ABMIL, CLAM without pair wise interactions) gain improvement, and we
speculate that the larger image-size can modelling the local context better.

2. DTFD try to split the whole bag into 3 sub-bags, but smaller bag size may result in larger label
noise of sub-bags which may answer its performance drop.

3. The gap between LongMIL and TransMIL decreases given closer n and d. Full attention and
LongMIL show small drops, since less interactions can be modelled with less patches.

4. LongMIL still out-performs full attention. We speculate that local attention also works better when
dealing with the shape-varying WSI even with less n.

Memory efficiency and speed

We show the memory efficiency and speed of various transformer structures in Fig. 7.

A.5.6
Linear Attention

We provide ablation on different linear attention e.g. RetNet, GLA [67, 85] and linear RNN structure
like Mamba [26] to uncover their advantages and limitations in WSI analysis. As shown in Table
9, we first show the results of these vanilla Linear attention or RNN directly as MIL model (first
row), but none of these methods can compete with Full Attention in performance. Then, we combine
these modules into our LongMIL to replace its last global attention layer and we observe that this can
provide us strong performance as well as linear complexity in total (2 layers of local attention + 1
layer of linear attention, better than two layers of Full Attention in both speed and performance).

A.6
Detailed comparison to Prov-GigaPath

1. The motivation /contribution: our paper not only focus on proposing an efficient self-attention
mechanism for WSI, but also showing analysis on why some previous work like Roformer and
TransMIL fail for WSI from the low-rank perspective, which we believe to be insightful to the digital
pathology community. However, both the Prov-GigaPath [84] and LongViT [76] focus on scaling up
to a large-scale of data with pre-training, which is more empirical. We believe that our analysis may
also work for Prov-GigaPath and could be one potential explain on why Prov-GigaPath success and
how to improve further.

2. The method details: Prov-GigaPath does not treat interactions inside x-axis and y-axis equally,
though the 2-d positional embedding is applied. By putting all patches into a 1-d sequence in a ’z-scan’
manner like ViT, their 1-d local attention focus more on x-axis but less on y-axis, as depicted in Fig.
5. Although this can be alleviated by their higher-level dilated attention term, the x-y inequality still
exists. Whereas, our local-attention is designed for 2-d (based on 2d Euclid distance), thus treat them
equally.

3. The pretrained Prov-GigaPath WSI-head seems relying heavily on their own patch-pretrained
encoder, which may be a potential barrier to wide usage, e.g. there are still some cases when GigaPath

(depicted as Flash Attention) for self-attention calculation convert memory complexity to linear,
even better than Nyströmformer. Lower: lash Attention with chunk method still suffers quadratic
complexity in speed even with hardware-aware accelerated operations. Our introduced LongMIL for
WSI analysis can convert it as linearity with local-window mask. We also show markers about the
max instance number of WSI used in this paper to show potentials on higher (e.g. 40x) magnification
learning. We omit more instances (e.g. over 50k) speed test since it takes a long time, but based on its
quadratic complexity of full self-attention, it will be about 25 to 35 times slower than linear attention.

patch features weaker than UNI or Conch, as posted in the github repo of UNI. The WSI pretraining
is indeed useful as the key to their superior performance, which covers their problem of spatial
inequality on x and y. When dealing with the case ’BRACS’, as shown in the following table, our
method (even AB-MIL) with better UNI feature can outperform their ’worse patch feature with
stronger pretrained slide encoder’.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our main claim is clear that the low-rank with sparsity of attention matrix
could be the key to improve effectiveness and efficiency for Transformer based WSI analysis.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the two main limitations including application scene and
current employed limited embedding size considering speed and fair comparison, in the last
section of main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide full set of assumptions and complete proof for both low-rank
bottleneck and high-rank of local band matrix. For the latter one, the proof by sub-matrix is
clear and we also provide a full local band matrix (n = 9 in main paper) in supplemental
material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide comprehensive details of dataset selection and pre-processing,
together with training details. We will release full code implementation.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All our data is public and use ’CLAM’ for pre-processing. We will release full
code implementation.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide model backbone selection and implementation details in core
paper and further provide data split and pre-processing in supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For each experiments we have reported the mean and std via multi-runs or
cross-folds. We also show some p-value significance in train small test large experiment in
supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

27


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our memory efficiency method is run on RTX3090 GPU (24g), as detailed in
core paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and understood the policies, and we
believe that neither the manuscript nor the study violates any of these.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: There is no negative societal impact of our paper. Our work focus on computer
aided diagnosis for potential medical use, which is discussed in conclusions of core paper.

Guidelines:

28


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work mainly focus on recognition for real-world medical pathology image,
without any generative problem.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All the data and tools are public accessible and well referenced.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

29


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no new assets right now.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

30


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
