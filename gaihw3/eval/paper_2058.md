Abstract

Diffusion models equipped with language models demonstrate excellent controlla-
bility in image generation tasks, allowing image processing to adhere to human
instructions. However, the lack of diverse instruction-following data hampers the
development of models that effectively recognize and execute user-customized
instructions, particularly in low-level tasks. Moreover, the stochastic nature of the
diffusion process leads to deficiencies in image generation or editing tasks that
require the detailed preservation of the generated images. To address these limita-
tions, we propose PromptFix, a comprehensive framework that enables diffusion
models to follow human instructions to perform a wide variety of image-processing
tasks. First, we construct a large-scale instruction-following dataset that covers
comprehensive image-processing tasks, including low-level tasks, image editing,
and object creation. Next, we propose a high-frequency guidance sampling method
to explicitly control the denoising process and preserve high-frequency details in un-
processed areas. Finally, we design an auxiliary prompting adapter, utilizing Vision-
Language Models (VLMs) to enhance text prompts and improve the model’s task
generalization. Experimental results show that PromptFix outperforms previous
methods in various image-processing tasks. Our proposed model also achieves com-
parable inference efficiency with these baseline models and exhibits superior zero-
shot capabilities in blind restoration and combination tasks. The dataset and code
are available at https://www.yongshengyu.com/PromptFix-Page.

Introduction

In recent years, diffusion models [19, 57, 66] have achieved remarkable advancements in text-
to-image generation. Benefiting from large-scale training on image-text pairs [59], these models
can generate highly realistic and diverse images that align with text prompts. They have been
successfully applied to various real-world applications, including visual design, photography, digital
art, and the film industry. In addition, models trained with instruction-following data [7] have shown
promising results in understanding human instruction and performing the corresponding image-
processing tasks. Previous studies [21–23, 74, 73] have illustrated that with instruction-following
data, we can simply fine-tune a text-to-image generation model to perform various vision tasks
such as image editing [7, 21, 74], object detection [22], segmentation [23], inpainting [23, 73], and
depth estimation [22, 9]. To follow the success of these methods, we train our model utilizing
input-goal-instruction triplet data for low-level image-processing tasks.

We first overcome the challenge of lacking the instruction-following data for low-level tasks. Specifi-
cally, we collect image pairs by generating degraded images from the source images and adopting
data from existing datasets. Then, we employ GPT4 [51] to generate the diverse text instructions
for each task. We obtain ∼1.01 million input-goal-instruction triplets in the collected dataset. This
dataset covers various low-level tasks including image inpainting, object creation, image dehazing,
colorization, super-resolution, low light enhancement [8], snow removal, and watermark removal.
We enrich the dataset through back-translation augmentation by swapping the inpainted and origi-

Figure 1: We propose PromptFix, a unified diffusion model capable of performing multiple image-
processing tasks. It can understand user-customized editing instructions and perform the correspond-
ing tasks with high quality. One of the key advantages of PromptFix is high-frequency information
preservation, ensuring that image details are maintained throughout VAE decoding. PromptFix can
handle various images with different aspect ratios.

nal images within the triplet and inverting the semantic orientation of the prompt. This technique
effortlessly converts datasets from object removal to object creation. We also provide comprehensive
details in Section 3.

With the dataset, we design a new diffusion-based model named PromptFix that can understand
user-customized instructions and perform the corresponding low-level image-processing tasks. In
PromptFix, we address several challenges that compromise the performance of the model. First,
the use of stable-diffusion architecture [57] as a generative prior often faces the issue of spatial
information loss, which is caused by VAE compression [20]. Unlike unconditional or text-to-image
generation, maintaining spatial detail consistency in image processing poses significant challenges,
particularly with high-frequency components like text, as shown in Figure 5. To tackle this problem,
we introduce High-frequency Guidance Sampling, in which we use a low-pass filter operator [50, 53]
to calculate the fidelity constraint and integrate VAE skip-connect features during inference with a
lightweight LoRA [27] fusion. Second, since the generative prior is not trained on low-level images,
so relying solely on instructions may not always yield the desired outcome, especially when the image
degradation is severe. To tackle this degradation adaptation problem, we introduce an auxiliary prompt

2


---Page Break---
module to provide models with more descriptive text prompts to enhance controllability for image
generation. The auxiliary text prompt can be obtained by VLMs [43]. This approach introduces
a semantic caption for a degraded image and the description of its defects, such as blurriness or
insufficient lighting. The auxiliary prompt module is implemented by an additional attention layer in
diffusion U-Net that adapts both instruction and auxiliary prompts as conditions and intermittently
omits instructional prompts during training. We identify three key advantages of this approach: 1)
enabling the model to process images with severe degradation, such as extremely low-resolution
images, 2) adapting the model for blind restoration for different types of image degradation, and 3)
providing additional pathways for a more precise semantic representation of the target image.

Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in the instruction-
based paradigm across three image editing tasks (colorization, watermark removal, object removal)
and four image restoration tasks (dehazing, desnowing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement)
in terms of perceptual pixel similarity [75] and no-reference image quality [72]. In summary, our
contributions are three-fold:

• We propose a comprehensive dataset tailored for seven image processing tasks. The dataset
contains ∼1.01 million diverse paired input-output images along with corresponding image
editing instructions.
• We propose a new all-in-one instruction-guided diffusion model – PromptFix for low-level
image-processing tasks. Extensive experimental results show that PromptFix outperforms
previous methods in a wide variety of image-processing tasks and exhibits superior zero-shot
capabilities in blind restoration and combination tasks.
• We introduce two approaches – high-frequency guidance sampling and auxiliary prompt
module to diffusion models to effectively address the issues of high-frequency information
loss and the failure in processing the severe image degradation for instruction-based diffusion
models in low-level tasks.

Instruction-guided Image Editing

Instruction-guided image editing significantly improves the ease and precision of visual manipulations
by adhering to human directions. In traditional image editing, models primarily focused on singular
tasks such as style transfer or domain adaptation [24, 55], leveraging various techniques to encode
images into a manipulatable latent space, such as those used by StyleGAN [34]. Concurrently,
the advent of text-to-image diffusion models [26, 57, 63, 65] has broadened the scope of image
editing [7, 25]. Kim et al. [35] showed how to perform global changes, whereas Avrahami et al. [4]
successfully performed local manipulations using user-provided masks for guidance. While most
works that require only text (i.e., no masks) are limited to global editing [17, 36]. Bar-Tal et al.
[6] proposed a text-based localized editing technique without using any mask, showing impressive
results. For local image editing, precise manipulations are possible by inpainting designated areas
using either user-provided or algorithmically predicted masks [16], all while preserving the visual
integrity of the adjacent areas. In contrast, instruction-based image editing operates through direct
commands like “add fireworks to the sky,” avoiding the need for detailed descriptions or regional
masks. Recent approaches utilize synthetic input-goal-instruction triples [7] and incorporate human
feedback [76] to execute editing instructions effectively. Despite the advances in using diffusion
models for various instruction-guided image editing tasks, there is still a notable gap in research
specifically addressing instruction-guided image restoration with these models. Our study aims to
bridge this gap by collecting a comprehensive dataset of paired low-level instruction-driven image
editing examples and proposing an all-in-one model for low-level tasks and editing.

2.2
Large Language Models for Vision

Recent advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the
emergence of powerful models with extensive capabilities [15, 31, 39, 43, 77]. These LLMs, pre-
trained on large-scale internet-based datasets, are equipped with broad knowledge bases that enhance
their zero-shot and in-context learning abilities [5, 29, 51]. Furthermore, there is a growing focus
on using LLMs for multimodal tasks [3, 30, 42, 45], incorporating methods like vision-language

alignment and adapter fine-tuning. These techniques ensure that the visual data processed by visual
encoders is semantically aligned with the textual input of LLMs [43]. This approach has spurred
significant advancements in Text-to-Image generation, leading to the development of various LLM-
based diffusion models for these tasks [28, 40, 41]. Despite these successes, there remains a relative
scarcity of research focusing on using large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for instructed image
editing, particularly in detailed, low-level editing tasks.

Data Curation

Current off-the-shelf image datasets [7, 74, 76] with instructional annotations primarily facilitate
image editing research, encompassing tasks such as color transfer, object replacement, object removal,
background alteration, and style transfer. Nevertheless, their overlap with low-level applications is
limited. Moreover, we find it challenging to achieve satisfactory results for existing models in image
restoration. Our goal is to construct a comprehensive visual instruction-following dataset specifically
for low-level tasks. We obtain ∼1.01 million training triplet instances.

Paired Image Collection. We initially gather source images from various existing datasets. Sub-
sequently, we produce degraded and inpainted images to create an extensive set of paired image
data. We compile approximately two million raw data points across eight tasks: image inpainting,
object creation, image dehazing, image colorization, super-resolution, low-light enhancement, snow
removal, and watermark removal. For the test set, we randomly select 300 image pairs for each task.
More details about the dataset composition are provided in the Appendix A.1.

Instruction Prompts Generation. For each low-level task, we utilized GPT-4 to generate diverse
training instruction prompts Pinstruction. These prompts include task-specific and general instructions.
The task-specific prompts, exceeding 250 entries, clearly define the task objectives. For example,
"Improve the visibility of the image by reducing haze" for dehazing. The general instructions include
five ambiguous commands that we retained as "negative" prompts to promote adaptive tasks. The
specific instruction prompts used for training are detailed in the appendix. For watermark removal,
super-resolution, dehazing, snow removal, low-light enhancement, and colorization tasks, we also
generate "auxiliary prompts" for each instance. These auxiliary prompts describe the quality issues
for the input image and provide semantic captions. More details are discussed in Section 4.2.

Diffusion Model

Diffusion models transform data into noise through gradual Gaussian perturbations during a forward
process and subsequently reconstruct samples from this noise in a backward process. In the forward
phase, an original data point, denoted as z0, is incrementally altered towards a Gaussian noise
distribution ϵ ∼N(0, I), according to the equation:

zt = q(z0, ϵ, t) = αtz0 + σtϵ,
∀t ∈[0, T],
(1)

where αt and σt are coefficients that manage the signal-to-noise ratio at each interpolation point zt.
This process aims to maintain variance, adopting coefficient strategies as detailed in sources such as
[33]. Modeled as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) in continuous time, the forward process
can be expressed as dz = f(z, t)dt + g(t)dwt, where f(z, t) is a vector-valued drift coefficient, g(t)
is the diffusion coefficient, and wt represents Brownian motion at time t.

The backward diffusion process, made possible by notable characteristics of the SDE, is rearticu-
lated via Fokker-Planck dynamics [66] to yield deterministic transitions with consistent probability
densities, creating the probability flow ODE:

dz =

f(z, t) −1

2g(t)2∇z log pt(z)

dt.
(2)

This equation outlines a transport mechanism that is learnable through maximum likelihood tech-
niques, applying the perturbation kernel of diffused data samples ∇z log pt(z|z0), as demonstrated
in [32, 66]. Next, we sample zt ∼N(0, I) to initialize the probability flow ODE, and the estimates
for the score function via ˆϵ(zt, t)/σt. We employ the Euler method [64, 66] among numerical ODE
solvers to obtain the solution trajectory: z0 ≈HN ◦HN−1 ◦· · · ◦H1(zT ), where H denotes the
diffusion model and N represents the neural function evaluations (NFEs) for sampling.

During the training phase, a simple diffusion loss [26] is utilized, whereby the neural network still
employs forward inference to predict noise. The sample data estimate z0 can be obtained at any step
t by using the current noisy data and the predicted noise and is derived as:

zt→0 = zt −σtˆϵ(zt, t)

αt
.
(3)

To reduce computational costs, the aforementioned diffusion process initiates from isotropic Gaussian
noise samples in the latent space [57], rather than the pixel space. This space transformation is
facilitated through VAE compression [20]. The VAE autoencoder comprises an encoder E(·) and a
left inverse decoder D(·). For instance, an image x can be encoded into a latent code E(x), which
can then be approximately reconstructed back into the pixel space as x ≈D ◦E(x).

4.2
VLM-based Auxiliary Prompt Module

Given that low-level image processing focuses on handling degraded images rather than real-world
images, we adopt the integration of a VLM to estimate an auxiliary prompt for the low-level image I.
This auxiliary prompt encompasses both semantic captions and defect descriptions to enhance the
semantic clarity of the target image, thereby addressing the instructional gaps inherent in low-level
image processing tasks.

5


---Page Break---
Based on text dialogues parameterized by ω within a VLM V(·; ω), we employ a frozen VLM,
specifically the InternVL2 [15] model, which integrates visual and linguistic modalities as inputs. We
facilitate this model to receive paired degraded image I and a textual query Q. To handle the visual
input, the InternVL2 first employs a pre-trained encoding model to map each modality into a shared
representation space. The visual encoding model ϕ embeds I into the textual space, resulting in ϕ(I),
which is then combined with the tokenized language embedding τ(Q). These combined embeddings
are fed into the large language model, producing the textual response R.

R(I, Q) = V(ϕ(I), τ(Q); ω)
(4)

The visual encoding model of InternVL2 has not undergone extensive fine-tuning in the degradation
domain. To acquire an explicit understanding from both semantic and low-level defect perspectives,
we meticulously curate the queries Qsemantic and Qdefect to guide InternVL2, respectively. Specific
query instances are provided in the Appendix. As illustrated in Figure 4 and described by Equation 5,
we concatenate the responses related to semantics and degradation textually, forming Pauxiliary, which
serves as the auxiliary prompt. This acts as a supplement to the instruction prompt Pinstruction.

Pauxiliary = [R(I, Qsemantic), R(I, Qdefect)]
(5)

The conditioned text prompts guide the diffusion model by injecting the embedding into the cross-
attention layer [57]. After obtaining the auxiliary prompt, a straightforward approach involves
concatenating it with the user-input instruction prompt before feeding the text embedding into the
diffusion model. However, this concatenation can render the entire prompt excessively long, leading
to forced truncation during tokenization. Therefore, after utilizing the pre-trained CLIP visual encoder
ViT-L/14 [54] to extract linguistic features, we process the text embeddings of Pinstruction and Pauxiliary
separately. We introduce additional cross-attention layers identical to the original ones, as depicted
in Figure 2. The embeddings of Pinstruction and Pauxiliary are fed into the Key and Value heads of
consecutive attention networks, respectively, thereby achieving an augmented cross-attend adaptation.

4.3
High-frequency Guidance Sampling

There is a fundamental requirement in image restoration and generation tasks: the processed image
must maintain high accuracy in semantics. We observe that vanilla VAE reconstructions tend to lose
image details such as textual rendering, which contains high-frequency information, as shown in
Figure 5. Therefore, we propose high-frequency guidance sampling to balance the quality and fidelity
of generation.

The denoising sampling is based on the EDM formulation [33]. To maintain spatial information,
we utilize a modified VAE Decoder Dθ to map from the latent space to the pixel space. We
modify the VAE decoder by passing skip-connect features from the VAE encoder through additional
LoRA convolutions [27] to merge the feature map. The LoRA networks are initialized randomly,
with their trainable parameters denoted as θ. Since the parameters of the LoRA convolution are
lightweight, merely multi-step backpropagation can maintain high-frequency consistency without
requiring extensive fine-tuning.

We propose a fidelity constraint to model the spatial discrepancy between the image and the ground
truth. We implement two types of high-pass operators to extract high-frequency signals from the
degraded image. For the Fourier filtering operator F(·), we convert the generated image from
the spatial to the frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform [50]. High-frequency
components are then isolated via high-pass filtering and reconstituted into an image through the
Inverse Fourier Transform [50]. Meanwhile, we apply the Sobel [53] edge detection operator S(·)
as a complement. The fidelity constraint evaluates the divergence between the high-frequency
components of the ground truth and the processed image, ensuring the preservation of spatial
information throughout the sampling process. Additionally, to obtain the image at time step t, we
utilize predicted noise ϵ from diffusion model H to compute the zt→0 estimation at any time step.
The fidelity constraint is calculated as follows:

L(I, Dθ(zt→0)) = ∥F(I) −F(Dθ(zt→0))∥2
2 + ∥S(I) −S(Dθ(zt→0))∥2
2
(6)

Given that zt>0 represents a noisy latent variable, assigning equal weight to each timestep’s latent
is impractical. To mitigate the cumulative error induced by this practice, we introduce a time-scale
weight e−λt. The overall sampling algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1.

Quantitative and Qualitative Results

Table 1 illustrates the comparative analysis of image restoration and editing techniques, evaluated
via LPIPS and ManIQA metrics. The expert model – Diff-Plugin shows limited but notable per-
formance in low-light enhancement (LPIPS/ManIQA: 0.227/0.453) and desnowing (0.133/0.508).
Among generalist methods, AirNet demonstrates balanced capabilities in tasks like desnowing and
dehazing, achieving LPIPS/ManIQA scores of 0.245/0.589 and 0.039/0.780, respectively. However,
the instruction-driven diffusion methods reveal a more nuanced picture, with PromptFix emerging
as particularly promising. It excels in colorization (LPIPS/ManIQA: 0.233/0.489), object removal
(0.054/0.810), and watermark removal (0.071/0.811), consistently outperforming others. InstructP2P
and InstructDiff also perform well in specific tasks, such as low-light enhancement and dehazing, but
do not match the overall versatility of PromptFix. MGIE, though effective in certain domains, lacks
the consistency seen in "PromptFix (Ours)." This highlights the robustness and superior performance

of PromptFix across diverse image processing tasks and indicates the potential of PromptFix to set
new benchmarks in the field, driven by advanced instruction-driven diffusion methodologies.

Figure 3 illustrates the visual comparison across all selected baseline models. In colorization, our
PromptFix produces the most visually accurate and vibrant results, closely resembling the ground
truth. For the watermark removal task, it effectively restores the original image without introducing
artifacts, outperforming MGIE [21] and other methods. In desnowing and low-light enhancement,
PromptFix achieves clearer and more natural outputs, significantly reducing noise and enhancing
visibility. Additionally, in super-resolution, PromptFix demonstrates remarkable clarity and accuracy,
preserving fine details and surpassing all comparative methods. In dehazing, although PromptFix’s
performance is visually comparable to image restoration experts PromptIR [52] and AirNet [38],
PromptFix outperforms the recent stable-diffusion-based method Diff-plugin [46], achieving a clean,
sharp appearance, and closely matching the ground truth.

Ablation Study

Effectiveness of High-frequency Guidance Sampling. The High-frequency Guidance Sampling
(HGS) method is introduced to balance fidelity and quality. To validate the effectiveness of HGS, we
conduct qualitative experiments and quantitative experiments. As depicted in Figure 5, in a low-light
scenario, the model aims to enhance the visibility (quality) of the input image while preserving its
original textual details (fidelity). For baselines leveraging stable-diffusion as a generative prior, the
strong compression capability of VAE also brings the issue of spatial information loss, as demonstrated
by InstructDiff [23], MGIE [21], and Diff-Plugin [46] in Figure 5. This issue is independent of the
model’s ability to effectively follow instructions. As shown by the variant “Ours w/o HGS,” our
method significantly enhances low-light images compared to the three baselines, yet still fails to retain
small-scale textual structures. By incorporating HGS, as seen in “Ours,” the proposed framework
delivers a high-fidelity solution that also meets the low-light enhancement instruction. The usage of
F(·) and S(·) improves the quality of the image generated, demonstrated by the quantitative results
shown in Table 4.

VLM-guided blind restoration. We utilize InternVL2 [15] to generate auxiliary prompts and leave
the instruction prompt empty. This approach enables users to input an image without the need to
provide instructions for its restoration. We evaluate the model’s performance on such blind restoration
tasks, including low-light enhancement, desnowing, and dehazing. As shown in Table 3, our model
achieves performance comparable to four baselines, showing minimal perceptual differences from
the ground truth and superior zero-shot capabilities.

Multi-task processing. Although PromptFix is not explicitly trained to handle multiple low-level
tasks simultaneously within the same image, it demonstrates the capability for multi-task process-
ing. We construct the validation dataset with 200 images, and each image contains 3 restoration
tasks such as colorization, watermark removal, low-light enhancement, desnowing, dehazing, and
super-resolution. We benchmarked PromptFix against AirNet and PromptIR, both generalist image
restoration methods, as well as InstructP2P and InstructDiff, which are instruction-driven diffusion
methods. As shown in Table 2, PromptFix outperforms these baselines, achieving superior image
quality, structural similarity, and minimal perceptual differences from the ground truth, as evidenced
by competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores, along with a higher ManIQA score indicating visu-
ally pleasing and high-quality results. Conversely, while methods like InstructP2P and InstructDiff
perform well in specific metrics, they do not match the overall balanced performance of PromptFix.
These results indicate the robustness and versatility of PromptFix.

Different types of instruction prompts. We verify PromptFix’s generalization to various human
instructions in Table 5, by conducting ablation comparisons with three types of prompts: instructions
used during training and out-of-training human instructions with fewer than 20 words and with 40-70
words. PromptFix’s performance slightly declines with out-of-training instructions, but the change is
negligible. It indicates that PromptFix is robust for instructions under 20 words, which is generally
sufficient for low-level processing tasks. We observe a performance drop with longer instructions,
possibly due to the long-tail effect of instruction length in the training data. Although low-level
processing tasks usually don’t require long instructions, addressing this issue by augmenting the
dataset with longer instructions could be a direction for future work.

Conclusion

We present PromptFix, a novel diffusion-based model along with a large-scale visual-instruction
training dataset, designed to benefit instruction-guided low-level image processing. PromptFix
effectively addresses challenges related to spatial information loss and degradation adaptation by
high-frequency guidance sampling and a VLM-based auxiliary prompt module. These mechanisms
improve the model’s performance in the instruction-based image-processing paradigm. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate PromptFix’s advanced capabilities of generating accurate and high
quality images. In addition to the improvement in terms of conventional metrics, we observe that
PromptFix is also effective at processing multi-task processing and achieving blind restoration in
low-light enhancement, desnowing, and dehazing.

PromptFix Dataset

The PromptFix dataset contains 1,013,320 triplet instances among 7 different tasks containing
object removal, image dehazing, colorization, debluring, low light enhancement, snow removal
and watermark removal. Each instance contains an input image, a processed image, an instruction,
and an auxiliary prompt generated by InternVL2 [15] which is only available for tasks except
object removal. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yeates/
PromptfixData.

Object removal: Mulan [67] provides multi-layer image decomposition annotations, inpainting
occluded areas and isolating instances in a scene on separate RGBA layers. We combine the
background layer and n foreground object layers to obtain the ground truth image and the background
layer and n + 1 foreground object layers to obtain the input image, where n ∈N. Different object
layers will be placed onto the background image based on their foreground-background relationships.

Image dehazing: We use a combination of synthetic datasets (RESIDE [37], SRRS [13]) and real-
world datasets (Dense-Haze [1], O-Haze [2]) for training, comprising 100 pairs of real-world images
and 102,230 pairs of indoor and outdoor synthetic images from ITS [37], OTS [37], SOTS outdoor
[37], and nyuhaze500 [37].

Colorization: We utilize a subset of Laion-5b [60] and Flickr comprising 317,225 images and
generate grayscale images.

Deblurring: We use a combination of GoPro [49], HIDE [61], LFDOF [58], RealBlur [56], TextOCR
[62], Wider-Face [71] and a subset of CelebA [48], which collectively contain 70,600 pairs of images.

Low light enhancement: We use a combination of LOL [70], SID [11], SMID [10], SDSD [68],
and construct a set of low light synthetic data based on Pexels and Flickr by reducing brightness and
adding noise, which collectively contains 212,618 pairs of images.

Snow removal: We use a combination of SRRS [13], CSD [14], RVSD [12], and Snow100K [47],
which collectively contains 99,177 pairs of images.

Watermark removal: We use a combination of CLWD [44] and LOGO30K [18], which collectively
contain 124,805 pairs of images.

A.2
Limitations

Without relying on user input instructions, our PromptFix achieves blind restoration for low-level
enhancement, dehazing, and desnowing. However, we observe that this approach occasionally results
in out-of-conditioned image control, where the model performs text-to-image generation based on the
auxiliary prompt rather than image processing. Although blind restoration is a feature of our VLM-
based Auxiliary Prompt Module, for known degradations, we recommend providing user-custom
instructions to specify the restoration.

High-frequency Guidance Sampling significantly helps preserve the original image details, counter-
acting the spatial information loss caused by VAE compression. Nevertheless, we find that adopting
HGS makes the restored image slightly resemble the degraded image. While PromptFix remains
promising relative to baselines, as shown in Figure 5, results without HGS appear brighter than those
with HGS. As we have consistently claimed, employing HGS involves a trade-off between fidelity
and quality. In scenarios where VAE reconstruction is sufficiently faithful and user needs prioritize
quality, HGS may be omitted.

A.3
More Implementation Details

Below are the more detailed implementation specifics:

• Qsemantic: “Describe this image and its style in a very detailed manner"

• Qdefect: “Introduce the drawback of the image"

Parameters of the Sobel Operator: This involves applying two 3 × 3 kernels:

Gx =

"−1
0
1
−2
0
2
−1
0
1

#

and
Gy =

"−1
−2
−1
0
0
0
1
2
1

#

These kernels calculate gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. By convolving
these kernels with the image, we obtain the gradient magnitudes at each pixel. The default parameters
include a mid-range intensity threshold to discern significant edges.

Time-scale Weight λ: This weight is determined based on the time step of the diffusion model.
When the time step is larger, there is more noise, and the fidelity constraint should be decayed. As
depicted in Figure 7, the impact of the high-frequency loss exponentially decays with increasing
timestep. Empirically, we have set λ to 0.001.

Weight of Fidelity Constraint: The time-scale weight, which is determined by the time step of the
diffusion model, decreases as the time step increases, due to the increase in noise. Consequently, the
fidelity constraint should be decayed accordingly.

HGS Algorithm Notion Clarification: Using T to represent the neural function evaluations (NFEs)
for sampling, and S to denote a series of hyperparameters:

• Schurn controls the level of stochasticity.
• Snoise adjusts the noise standard deviation.
• Stmin and Stmax define the range of noise levels for stochasticity.

Efficiency analysis

We conduct an efficiency analysis for PromptFix and other recent baseline models, including Diff-
plugin [46] and InstructDiff [23], by profiling the floating-point operations (FLOPs) of their respective
diffusion models. As demonstrated in the table below, our method exhibits comparable efficiency
to these advanced models. This analysis reveals the capability of PromptFix to maintain high
computational efficiency while delivering superior performance in various image-processing tasks.

General PromptFix Results. We present additional image processing results in Figures 9-15, encom-
passing tasks including watermark removal, colorization, low-light enhancement, super-resolution,
dehazing, desnowing, inpainting, and object removal via bounding boxes. These results are generated
by our PromptFix model, utilizing an all-in-one pre-trained weight and guided by user-customized
instructions.

Mutli-task processing and blind restoration. In Figure 8, we present the qualitative results of multi-
task processing as a complement to the quantitative assessments detailed in Table 2. Additionally, we
provide further visualizations of VLM-guided blind restoration outcomes as in Figure 16.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count
towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The claims in the abstract and introduction align with the detailed findings and
discussions presented in the paper, accurately representing its scope and contributions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

26


---Page Break---
Justification: Please see appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper includes all necessary assumptions for each theoretical result and
provides thorough and accurate proofs, ensuring clarity and correctness.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, methodolo-
gies, and parameters, ensuring that the main results can be reproduced accurately.
Guidelines:

27


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We are ready to release data and code, along with comprehensive instructions,
enabling faithful reproduction of the main experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

28


---Page Break---
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:The paper provides comprehensive details on data splits, hyperparameters,
selection methods, and the type of optimizer used, ensuring a thorough understanding of the
experimental setup and results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The paper does not provide information on the statistical significance of the
experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper details the type of compute workers, providing all necessary
information for reproduction.

29


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, ensuring ethical standards
are met in all aspects, including data use, transparency, and the potential impact of the
findings.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not focus on potential societal impacts, either positive or
negative, of the work performed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

30


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The paper does not mention any specific safeguards for the responsible release
of data or models that might be susceptible to misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: They are cited appropriately in the paper, with licenses and terms of use clearly
mentioned and respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide new visual instruction datasets for low-level tasks, and the docu-
mentation is comprehensive and available alongside the datasets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.

31


---Page Break---
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not conduct crowdsourcing experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The study does not involve human subjects, so IRB approval or equivalent
review is not applicable.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
