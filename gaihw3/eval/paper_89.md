Abstract

When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to
know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-
performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others
introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we
first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and
then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can
create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational
overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform
baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary
for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using
LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty
estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty
estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty
of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of
LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.

Introduction

“I have high cortisol but low ACTH on a dexamethasone suppression
test. What should I do?” If the answer to such a question is given without associated
confidence, it is not actionable, and if the answer is presented with erroneously high confidence, then
acting on the answer is dangerous. One of the biggest open questions about whether large language
models (LLMs) can benefit society and reliably be used for decision making hinges on whether or
not they can accurately represent uncertainty over the correctness of their output.

There is anything but consensus on whether LLMs accurately represent uncertainty, or even how
we should approach uncertainty representation with language models. Claims regarding language
models’ ability to estimate uncertainty vary widely, with some works suggesting that language models
are increasingly capable of estimating their uncertainty directly through prompting, without any
fine-tuning or changes to the training data [25, 51], and others suggesting that LLMs remain far too
overconfident in their predictions [60, 61]. The task of uncertainty estimation in LLMs is further
exacerbated by linguistic variances in freeform generation, all of which cannot be exhaustively

Fine-Tuning

Figure 1: Large language models struggle to assign reliable confidence estimates to their
generations. We study the properties of uncertainty calibration in language models, and propose
fine-tuning for better uncertainty estimates using a graded dataset of generations from the model.
We evaluate our methods on a new open-ended variant of MMLU [18]. We show that fine-tuning
improves expected calibration error (ECE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) compared to commonly-used baselines. Error bars show standard deviation over three base
models (LLaMA-2 13/7B and Mistral 7B) and their chat variants.

accounted for during training. LLM practitioners are therefore faced with the challenge of deciding
which estimation method to use.

One particular dichotomy in uncertainty estimation methods for language models centers around
whether the estimates are black- or white-box. Black-box estimates do not require training and can
be used with closed-source models like GPT-4 [1] or Gemini [48], while white-box methods require
training parameters on a calibration dataset. Although black-box estimates have become popular with
the rise of restricted models, the increased availability of strong open-source models, such as LLaMA
[53] or Mistral [24], has made more effective white-box methods more accessible.

In this paper, we perform a deep investigation into uncertainty calibration of LLMs, with findings
that advance the debate about necessary interventions for good calibration. In particular, we consider
whether it’s possible to have good uncertainties over correctness (rather than tokens) without inter-
vention, how we can best use labeled correctness examples, how well uncertainty generalizes across
distribution shifts, and how we can use LLM uncertainty to assist human decision making.

First, we find that fine-tuning for better uncertainties (Figure 1) provides faster and more reliable
uncertainty estimates, while using a relatively small number of additional parameters. The resulting
uncertainties also generalize to new question types and tasks, beyond what is present in the fine-tuning
dataset. We further provide a guide to teaching language models to know what they don’t know using
a calibration dataset. Contrary to prior work, we start by showing that current zero-shot, black-box
methods are ineffective or impractically expensive in open-ended settings (Section 4). We then show
how to fine-tune a language model for calibration, exploring the most effective parameterization (e.g.
linear probes vs LoRA) and the amount of the data that is required for good generalization (Section 5).
To test generalization, we evaluate uncertainty estimates on questions with similar formatting to the
calibration data as well as questions that test robustness to significant distribution shifts. Lastly, we
consider the underlying mechanisms that enable fine-tuning LLMs to estimate their own uncertainties,
showing ultimately that models can be used not just to estimate their own uncertainties but also the
uncertainties of other models (Section 6). Beyond offline evaluation, if language models are to have a
broad societal impact, it will be through assisting with human decision making. We conduct a user
study demonstrating ways LLM uncertainty can affect AI-human collaboration (Section 7).2

Related Work

As generative models, LLMs naturally express a distribution over possible outcomes and should
capture variance in the underlying data. On multiple-choice tests, where the answer is a single token,
an LLM’s predicted token probabilities can lead to a calibrated distribution over the answer choices
[43]. When answers consist of entire sentences, however, language model likelihoods become a less
reliable indicator of uncertainty because probabilities must be spread over many phrasings of the same
concept. Kuhn et al. [30] attempt to mitigate this issue by clustering semantically equivalent answers.
However, these methods are hindered by their substantial computational overhead. Accounting for
equivalent phrasings of the same semantic content requires enumerating a large space of sentences
and clustering for semantic similarity with an auxiliary model.

Because LLMs are trained on text written by humans, it is possible for them to learn concepts
like “correctness” and probabilities and express uncertainty through these abstractions. Leveraging
this observation, Kadavath et al. [25] and Tian et al. [51] show that careful prompting can produce
uncertainty estimates in text that grow more calibrated as model capabilities increases. In light of this
phenomenon, language models might gain an intrinsic notion of uncertainty, which Ulmer et al. [54]
use to generate per-task synthetic training data for an auxiliary confidence model. In the same vein,
Burns et al. [9] and Azaria and Mitchell [4] find that pre-trained models have hidden representations
which are predictive of truthfulness and use linear probes to classify a model’s correctness.

While these studies suggest a promising trend towards calibration, we find that the story is slightly
more complicated. Black-box methods often fail to generate useful uncertainties for popular open-
source models, and a careful fine-tuning intervention is necessary. In this way, our findings are
closer to those of Xiong et al. [60], who show that zero-shot uncertainty estimates have limited
ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect answers, even when used with the best available
models (e.g., GPT-4). We go further by showing that black-box methods struggle on open-ended
generation, which is both practically important and defined by different challenges than multiple
choice evaluations from prior work. Moreover, while others have focused on improving black-box
methods [30, 51, 60], we embrace open-source models and their opportunities for fine-tuning, showing
that we can maintain the speed of prompting methods while dramatically boosting performance.

Our work also contrasts with prior work on fine-tuning for uncertainties in several key ways. While
we build on prior work from Lin et al. [33] and Zhang et al. [63] that poses uncertainty estimation as
text completion on a graded dataset, we introduce several changes to the fine-tuning procedure, such
as regularization to maintain similar predictions to the base model, and provide extensive ablations
that yield actionable insights. For example, we show that, contrary to prior work [4], frozen features
are typically insufficient for uncertainty estimates that generalize effectively, and that fine-tuning on
as few as 1000 graded examples with LoRA is sufficient to generalize across practical distribution
shifts. Also unlike prior work, we provide many insights into the relative performance of fine-tuning
compared to black-box methods, introducing a new open-ended evaluation and showing that it
displays fundamentally different trends than prior work on multiple choice questions. Although
Kadavath et al. [25] also considers calibration for multiple choice questions, many of our conclusions
differ. For example, while Kadavath et al. [25] suggest that language models are strongest when
evaluating their own generations and subsequently posit that uncertainty estimation is linked to
self-knowledge, we find that capable models can readily learn good uncertainties for predictions
of other models without any knowledge of their internals. Lastly, while many works motivate their
approach with applications to human-AI collaboration, none of them test their uncertainty estimates
on actual users, as we do here.

Preliminaries

Question answering evaluations.
In all experiments, we use greedy decoding to generate answers
conditioned on questions with few-shot prompts. We then label the generated answers as correct
or incorrect and independently generate P(correct) using one of the uncertainty estimators. For
evaluation, we primarily use the popular MMLU dataset [18], which covers 57 subjects including
STEM, humanities, and social sciences. Crucially, however, we expand the original multiple choice
(MC) setting with a new open-ended (OE) setting. In the open-ended setting, we do not provide
answer choices, and the language model must generate an answer that matches the ground truth
answer choice. We determine a correct match by grading with a strong auxiliary language model
(Appendix A.2). We verify that grading via language models provides a cheap and effective proxy for
the gold standard human grading (Appendix A.3), consistent with related findings [10].

Metrics.
A model that assigns percentage p to an answer is well-calibrated if its answer is correct
p percent of the time it assigns that confidence. Calibration is typically measured using expected
calibration error (ECE) [37], which compares empirical frequences with estimated probabilities
through binning (Appendix A.4). A lower ECE is better, and an ECE of 0 corresponds to a perfectly
calibrated model. In addition to calibration, we measure the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model’s confidence. High AUROC indicates ability to filter
answers likely to be correct from answers that are likely to be incorrect, a setting typically called
selective prediction.

Temperature scaling.
Temperature scaling [42, 17] improves the calibration of a classifier by
scaling its logits by 1

T (where T is the temperature) before applying the softmax function. A high
temperature scales the softmax probabilities towards a uniform distribution, while a low temperature
collapses the distribution around the most probable output. The temperature parameter is learned on
held-out data, typically taken from the same distribution as the training set.

Do We Get Good Uncertainties Out-of-the-Box?

In this section, we focus on black-box3 methods for estimating a language model’s uncertainty. Due
to computational cost, we focus on methods that require a single sample or forward pass and only
consider sampling-based methods in the next section.

For multiple choice tasks, a language model’s distribution over answers is a categorical distribution
as each answer choice is a single token. Early work on LLMs, such as GPT-3, showed that this
distribution is often poorly calibrated [18]. Fundamentally, however, maximum likelihood training
should encourage calibration over individual tokens [15], and the calibration of recent LLMs appears
to improve in proportion with their accuracy [43].

In open-ended generation, on the other hand, answers are not limited to individual tokens nor a
prescribed set of possibilities, which introduces multiple sources of uncertainty. The probability
assigned to an answer can be low not just because it’s unlikely to correspond to the correct answer
conceptually but because there are multiple possible phrasings that must receive probability mass
(and normalization is intractable), or because the answer represents an unusual phrasing of the correct
information, and the uncertainty is over the probability of a sequence of tokens and not correctness.
For example, imagine a multiple-choice test in which we add an additional answer choice that is
a synonym of another. A sensible language model would assign equal likelihood to each choice,
lowering the probability it assigns to either individually. In open-ended generation the situation is
similar, but even more challenging because of variable length. Adding extra tokens can artificially
lower the likelihood of an answer even when it expresses the same concept, as the sequence of tokens
becomes less likely with increasing length.

We demonstrate the difference between multiple-choice question answering and open-ended gener-
ation in Figure 2 (left), where we compare the AUROC of a likelihood-based method for stan-
dard MMLU and open-ended MMLU (ours). For open-ended generations, we use perplexity,
PPL(s) = exp

1
N
PN
i=1 log p(si | s<i)

, where s is the tokenized sequence, because it is a length-
normalized metric and commonly used when token-level probabilities are exposed by the model
[19]. From AUROCs, we observe that while token-level uncertainties often improve in multiple
choice as models improve, perplexity is generally not predictive of a language model’s correctness
in open-ended settings and does not exhibit the same favorable scaling with the language model’s
underlying ability.

Because sequence likelihood (or perplexity) is limited as a confidence measure, prompting methods
have becoming an increasingly popular alternative. Lin et al. [33] introduced the following formats
that lay the foundation for recent work [51, 63]:

Name
Format
Confidence

Zero-Shot
Classifier
“Question. Answer. True/False: True”
P(“ True”) /
(P(“ True”) + P(“ False”))
Verbalized
“Question. Answer. Confidence: 90%”
float(“ 90%”)

In the first approach, the language model’s logits are used to create a binary classifier by scoring
two possible strings denoting true and false. Similarly, in Kadavath et al. [25], the classifier takes
in a slightly modified prompt, “Is the answer correct? (a) Yes (b) No ” and confidence is then
computed P(“(a)”) / (P(“(a)”) + P(“(b)”)). In the second approach (also used in [51, 60]), uncertainty
estimates are sampled as text and then converted into numbers. We provide the extended details in
Appendix B.2.

3Here we consider access to a model’s samples and token-level likelihoods as black-box. Some models do
not expose likelihoods directly, but they can be approximated through sampling.

Figure 2: (Left) We compare common uncertainty estimates for multiple-choice questions (max
softmax probability) and open-ended generation (perplexity). While maximum softmax probability
performs well and improves with the ability of the base model, perplexity does not follow the same
pattern. The plotted results are for all LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 models as well as Mistral 7B (base
and instruct). (Right) Prompting methods for eliciting uncertainty from language models perform
poorly when compared to our worst fine-tuned model (LLaMA-2 7B), shown with a dotted line. ECE
doesn’t appear to improve with the abilities of the underlying model, and while AUROC does show
small improvements with large improvements in accuracy, the gap between zero-shot methods and
fine-tuning for uncertainties remains large. Shading indicates a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval
on the regression fit.

The prospects of calibration by learning to model human language. If we view language modeling
as behavior cloning [46] on human writing, the optimal outcome is a language model that recapitulates
the full distribution of human writers present in the training data. Unfortunately, most humans exhibit
poor calibration on tasks they are unfamiliar with [28, 29, 32], and not all pre-training data is
generated by experts. Therefore it might be unreasonably optimistic to expect black-box methods to
yield calibrated uncertainties without a significant intervention. Alignment procedures (e.g. RLHF)
could improve the situation by penalizing cases of poor calibration, and the resulting procedure would
be akin to fine-tuning on graded data, which we explore in Section 5.

Experiments with open-source models. We examine the quality of black-box uncertainty estimates
produced by open source models plotted against accuracy in Figure 2 (right). We use LLaMA-2
[52, 53], Mistral [24], and LLaMA-3 models, and we evaluate on open-ended MMLU to highlight
how the methods might perform in a “chat-bot” setting. Because these models have open weights,
we can perform apples-to-apples comparisons with methods that train through the model or access
hidden representations. We see that prompting methods typically give poorly calibrated uncertainties
(measured by ECE) and their calibration does not improve out-of-the-box as the base model improves.
By contrast, AUROC does improve slightly with the power of the underlying model, but even the
best model still lags far behind the worse model with fine-tuning for uncertainty.

Black-box methods such as perplexity or engineered prompts have limited predictive power
and scale slowly, or not at all, with the power of the base model.

How Should We Use Labeled Examples?

Our goal is to construct an estimate for P(correct), the probability that the model’s answer is correct.
Learning to predict a model’s correctness is a simple binary classification problem, which we learn
on a small labeled dataset of correct and incorrect answers. There are many possible ways to
parameterize P(correct), and we study three that vary in their number of trainable parameters and
their use of prompting:

• Probe: Following Azaria and Mitchell [4], we train a small feed-forward neural network on the
last layer features of a LLM that was given the prompt, question, and proposed answer as input.
The model outputs P(correct) while keeping the base LLM frozen.

• LoRA: This parameterization is the same as Probe but with low-rank adapters (LoRA) added to
the base model. As a result, the intermediate language features of the base model can be changed
to improve the correctness prediction.

---Page Break---
• LoRA + Prompt: Following Kadavath et al. [25], we pose classifying correctness as a multiple
choice response with two values, the target tokens “i” and “ii” representing ‘no’ and ‘yes’
respectively. We perform LoRA fine-tuning on strings with this formatting.

With these different parameterizations, we can study how much information about uncertainty is
already contained in a pre-trained model’s features. Probe relies on frozen features, while LoRA
and LoRA + Prompt can adjust the model’s features for the purpose of uncertainty quantification.
Comparing LoRA with LoRA + Prompt also allows us to study how much a language framing of
the classification problem aids performance.

Datasets.
For training, we build a diverse set of samples from a collection of benchmark datasets,
similar to instruction-tuning [57]. From the list of 16 benchmark datasets in Appendix C.2, we use a
sampled subset of size approximately 20,000. We hold out 2000 data-points to use as a temperature
scaling calibration set [17].

Training and regularization.
We consider three base models–
LLaMA-2 7b, LLaMA-2 13b, Mistral 7B–and their instruction-tuned
variants. For fine-tuning, we use 8-bit quantization and Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) [20]. For LoRA, we keep the default hyperparame-
ters: rank r = 8, α = 32, and dropout probability 0.1. Each training
run takes approximately 1-3 GPU days with 4 NVIDIA RTX8000
(48GB) GPUs. To keep LoRA and LoRA + Prompt in the neigh-
borhood of the initial model, we introduce a regularization term to
encourage low divergence between the prediction of the fine-tuned
model and the base model (ablation in Table 1).

Sampling baseline.
We estimate the uncertainty by clustering generations by semantic similarity
[30]. The probability of each cluster becomes the probability assigned to all sequences in that
cluster. To assign an uncertainty to a prediction, we find the cluster closest to the prediction and use
the probability of the cluster as our uncertainty estimate (full details in Appendix B.1). The clear
drawback of this approach to uncertainty estimation is its poor scaling. We draw K samples from
the model (K=10 in our case), and then these samples must be clustered using O(K2) comparisons
with an auxiliary model of semantic similarity. Sampling methods are also complicated by their
relationship with hyperparameters such as temperature or nucleus size. In the special case where
the sampling parameters are chosen to produce greedy decoding (e.g. temperature zero), the model
will always assign probably one to its answer. While this behavior does align with the probability of
generating the answer, it is not a useful measure of confidence.

Fine-tuning results.
In Figure 3 (Left) we compare our three fine-tuned models with black-box
uncertainty methods on both multiple choice and open-ended MMLU. For multiple choice MMLU, we
also include the language model’s max softmax probability as a baseline. Fine-tuning for uncertainty
leads to significant improvements in both ECE and AUROC. While frozen features (Probe) are
sufficient to outperform baselines in multiple choice MMLU, performing well on open-ended MMLU
requires training through the modeling and prompting. Surprisingly, while sampling methods can
yield good calibration, their discriminative performance is very weak. By contrast, verbal elicitation
is relatively strong in discriminative performance, being on par with weaker fine-tuning methods, but
general has poor calibration, even after temperature scaling.

How much data do we need?
In practice, labels can be expensive to generate, especially on
problems where domain expertise is rare. Therefore, it would be advantageous if fine-tuning with
even a small number of examples is sufficient for building a good uncertainty estimate. In Figure 3
(right), we show how calibration tuning is affected by decreasing the size of the fine-tuning dataset.
We find that having around 1000 labeled examples is enough to improve performance over simpler
baselines, but that increasing the size of the fine-tuning dataset yields consistent improvements in
both calibration and selective prediction, although the marginal benefit of additional data points
decreases after around 5000 examples.

Supervised learning approaches, in which we learn to predict a model’s correctness, can
dramatically outperform baselines with as few as 1000 graded examples. Updating the
features of the model with LoRA and use of a language prompt are key to good performance.

points. Dotted lines indicate the performance of the classifier and sampling baselines averaged over

When and Why Do These Estimates Generalize?

To derive more understanding of when our estimates generalize, we now investigate distribution
shifts between the training and evaluation datasets. To have a practically useful tool, we might desire
robustness to the following shifts, among others:

Subject matter.
Ideally, our uncertainty estimates apply to subjects we have not seen during
training. In Figure 4 (left), we show a breakdown of our fine-tuning dataset using the supercategories
from MMLU (Appendix A.5). We see that our dataset contains much higher percentages of STEM
and humanities questions than MMLU and close to no examples from the social sciences (e.g.
government, economics, sociology). Despite these differences in composition, uncertainty estimates
from LoRA + Prompt perform similarly across supercategories. We also show the efficacy of our
models at assessing confidence on out of distribution coding tasks in Appendix F.

Format. Like a change in subject matter, the way a question is posed should not break the uncertainty
estimate. To test the effect of the question format independent of its subject matter, we apply models
fine-tuned on OE MMLU to MC MMLU and vice versa. In Figure 4 (center), we see that fine-tuned
models often perform better than a zero-shot baseline even when they are being applied across a
distribution shift, though transfer from MC to OE is more challenging than OE to MC. Probe is
insufficient to generalize effectively from MC to OE, but training through the features of the model
(LoRA + Prompt) does generalize effectively, even out-performing probe trained on OE data.

Solvability.
Even though we focus on questions with a single known answer, we might hope that
our estimates can be used even when a question is ill-posed or does not have a known solution, ideally
returning high uncertainty. We generate answers, labels, and uncertainty estimates for the answerable
and unanswerable questions in the SelfAware dataset [61] using the same procedure as OE MMLU.
In Figure 4 (right), we plot P(correct) from Zero-Shot Classifier and LoRA + Prompt
predicted for each answerable and unanswerable question. Notably, calibration-tuned models have
calibrated probabilities for the answerable questions and assign lower confidence to unanswerable
questions than black-box methods.

6.1
What are uncertainty estimates learning?

Language models can generate useful uncertainty estimates after training on a relatively small
number of labeled examples. How is this possible? We hypothesize two, potentially complementary
mechanisms: (a) LLMs assess the correctness of an answer given a question, or (b) LLMs recognize
that certain topics often have incorrect answers. To understand the difference, let’s explore a useful
metaphor. Imagine I speak only English, while my friend, Alice, is a linguaphile and dabbles in many

Figure 4: (Left) We compare the composition of the fine-tuning dataset with MMLU. Notably,
although the training dataset contains close to zero examples from social sciences, uncertainty
estimates from the model perform similarly across categories. (Center) Testing the generalization of
supervised methods by taking models trained on one setting (MCQA or OE) and evaluating them
on the other setting. The MCQA or OE labels denote the evaluation setting, with the method labels
indicate whether the model was trained on the same or different setting. Fine-tuning through the
model’s features (LoRA + Prompt) performs almost as well in transfer as on in-distribution data.
Zero-Shot Classifier involves no supervised learning except a temperature-scale step and is
a useful reference point. Error bars show two standard deviations over six fine-tuned models. (Right)
Fine-tuning leads to lower confidence on unanswerable questions, taken from the SelfAware dataset
[61]. Assigning low confidence to unanswerable questions allows the model to opt out of responding.

languages. I have a spreadsheet of how often Alice makes mistakes in each language. Now, when I
hear Alice attempting to converse in language A, I can guess how likely she is to err by recognizing
the language from its sound and consulting the spreadsheet. I can do this without understanding the
language at all. Alternatively, I can learn each language, which would be more complex but would
strengthen my predictions.

To disentangle these two possibilities in our setting, we perform an additional experiment, in which
we replace the language model’s answers in the fine-tuning dataset with incorrect answer options. If
a language model is simply learning patterns in the errors present in the training data, then we would
expect this ablation to perform on par with the original method because it suffices to learn patterns in
the content of the question and answer without needing the true causal relationship between question,
answer, and correctness label. The results are shown in Figure 5 (left). We see the model trained on
incorrect answers performs surprisingly well, on par with a Probe model, but significantly worse
than a model trained on the original sampled answers. Correlating question content with error rates
while moderately successful cannot be a full description of the LoRA + Prompt estimates.

Self-knowledge.
Lastly, we examine whether a language model can be used to model not just
its own uncertainties but the uncertainties of other models. Several prior works argue that models
identify correct questions by way of internal representations of truth, which might be unique to a
model evaluating its own generations [4, 9]. In Figure 5 (right), we show that, by contrast, Mistral 7B
actual has better AUROC values when applied to LLaMA-2 7B than LLaMA-2 7B applied to itself.
In Figure 5 (left), we show that sBERT [44] and OpenAI sentence embeddings are competitive with
Probe on both LLaMA-2 7B and Mistral. Together, these results suggest that LLM uncertainties are
likely not model-specific. The practical upside of this insight is that one strong base model can be
used to estimate the uncertainties of many other models, even closed-source models behind APIs,
when a small labeled dataset is available or can be generated.

Learned uncertainty estimates generalize to new formatting, subject matter, and even the
generations of other models. This generalization appears to stem not simply from judg-
ing a question’s difficulty based on its subject matter (a short-cut) but also learning the
correspondence between questions and correct answers.

Figure 5: (Left) We ablate the correspondence between questions and answers by training LoRA
+ Prompt on a dataset with correctness labels from the model’s generations but with the actual
generations swapped with incorrect answers. In this case, the only relationships that can be extracted
by the model are between the correctness labels and the questions. The model trained on incorrect
answers generalizes surprisingly well but is much worse than a model trained on the original answers.
Error bars show two standard deviations over three instruction-tuned models. (Center) We test how
well models can learn to predict the correctness of a different model (in terms of AUROC), and we
find that mistral models are often better at estimating the correctness of LLaMA models than LLaMA
can on their own generations. (Right) We show that generic sentence embeddings can also perform
on par with frozen language model representations (MMLU-OE), but training through a model is
much better. sBERT and OAIEmb refer to training a classifier on top of sBERT [44] or OpenAI
sentence embeddings. Error bars show two standard deviations over tasks in MMLU.

Does Calibrated Confidence Improve Collaboration with AI Assistants?

One key motivation for estimating LLM uncertainty is to signal the model’s reliability during
collaborative decision making. To examine how our uncertainty estimates can be used in this capacity,
we perform a preliminary user study (with N = 181 participants) in which participants complete a
multiple choice exam in collaboration with an LLM (Mistral 7B Instruct). For each question, the
participant is provided both the LLM’s prediction and an uncertainty estimate, which can be from a
calibrated method or an uncalibrated method. We hope to show that users are more likely to adopt
calibrated uncertainty scores as part of their decision process. A more detailed description of the
setup of our study is available in Appendix G.

People are sensitive to informed confidence scores.
Figure 6 shows density plots of the model’s
reported confidence and whether the user chose to agree with the model’s prediction. We find that
participants are sensitive to the confidence scores and tend to use scores when deciding to agree or
disagree with the model’s prediction if the uncertainties are reliable. On the other hand, participants
generally do not modulate their decision to rely on the output of a random confidence baseline
(Figure 6(c)), in which the display uncertainty estimate is generated uniformly at random. We see the
strongest discrepancy in reliance choices when LoRA + Probe confidence scores are presented,
highlighting that calibrated confidence does influence user behavior.

We include additional details and results in Appendix G. We find that confidence scores have the
biggest effect on improving the lowest performing users, rather than on average accuracy. However,
this is a preliminary result in the nascent field of studying LLM uncertainties in practical collaborative
decision making with users. We are only still scratching the surface of this question. For more
fine-grained conclusions, a study should be devoted to this subject. We outline several limitations and
future directions in Appendix G.

Users are sensitive to confidence scores and use their relative magnitude to modulate their
decision to use an LLM. Lower performing users are most improved by access to confidence
scores. However, future work is needed to disentangle the effects of calibration from how
humans choose to leverage uncertainties.

Discussion

There is much disagreement about the role of calibrated uncertainty in large language models, how
it can best be achieved, and promise of black-box methods. We hope to have shed light on these

Figure 6: We compare the distribution of LLM confidence (for Mistral 7B Instruct) on its answers,
and whether the users (N = 20 per variant) agree with the answer generated by the model or not. (a)
For the zero-shot prompt, we find that the model provides little signal since most mass is similarly
clustered. However, (b) improving the calibration of the model reveals an increased reliance on
the LLM for more confident answers, and decreased reliance for less confident answers. Evidently,
the users are sensitive to calibrated confidence scores. (c) For reference, we verify that uniformly
confidence scores do not provide meaningful signal, rendering users unable to modulate their decision
to rely on the LLM. All variants are compared at approximately the same average participant accuracy.

questions throughout this paper. In contrast to prior results, we find that out-of-the-box uncertainties
from LLMs are unreliable for open-ended generation and introduce a suite of fine-tuning procedures
that produce calibrated uncertainties with practical generalization properties. In the process, we
discovered that fine-tuning is surprisingly sample efficient and does not seem to rely on representations
of correctness specific to a model evaluating its own generations, allowing estimators to be applied
from one model to another. Moreover, we found it is possible, at least in the cases we considered, for
calibrated uncertainties to be robust to distribution shifts.

There are many exciting questions for future work. Currently fine-tuning relies on two separate
models for question answering and uncertainty estimation. Ideally, we want a single model that can
generate questions and uncertainty without switching between model weights. We anticipate that an
uncertainty-aware pre-training or alignment phase might become essential but implementing such a
procedure while maintaining base language modeling abilities will introduce a challenging online
learning problem where the correctness labels evolve during training.

Beyond improving the safety and usefulness of language models, high quality uncertainties can
also be used in active learning procedures, e.g. for sample-efficient fine-tuning [39], where data
points are selected based on the predicted utility and the model’s uncertainty, in order to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. Uncertainty estimates can also be used to improve factuality of language
models by increasing the likelihood of generations that the model is confident about (judges likely to
be correct), for example by using an alignment procedure (e.g. RLHF, DPO) with a reward function
that encourages confident generations [50].

We also showed how uncertainty information could be used to influence human decision making. In
the end, LLMs will impact society through decision making, and to make reasonable decisions we
need uncertainty information — particularly to protect against rare but costly mistakes.

matching process only involves checking the first token generated via greedy decoding.

For open-ended evaluations, determining if the answer given is correct is more complex. One simple
approach is to check if the ground truth answer A appears as a substring of answer ˆA. However,
this does not capture rephrasings that may be essentially equivalent - such as "NYC" for "New York

City," or "Daoism" and "Taoism." Conversely, it also has the potential to be over-generous if the
model is particularly verbose and emits many incorrect answers along with the correct string. Given
the difficulty involved in writing a rule-based method for evaluating open-ended answer correctness,
we use instead a strong auxiliary language model to evaluate correctness. The auxiliary language
model is shown the query Q, the ground truth answer A, and the model’s output ˆA, and is prompted
to grade the answer whilst tolerating nuance. For full details of the prompt used see (Figure 7). In this
paper we utilise GPT 3.5 Turbo as the auxiliary grading model. We conduct a comparison of human
grading, substring grading, and GPT 3.5 Turbo grading on select subsets of MMLU in Appendix A.3.
We find that humans and GPT 3.5 Turbo have much greater agreement than humans and the substring
method.

A.2
Grading

Dataset Construction.
To perform calibration-tuning (CT), we need tuples (Q, A, ˆA, C), answers
from a language model that have been graded for correctness. When calibration-tuning on multiple
choice questions, we can use an exact string match to generate C. To grade open-ended answers, we
use a strong language model and grading prompt G instead (Figure 7):

• G: a prompt used for grading answers ˆ
A with A.

Compared to alternatives like exact match, language model grading is insensitive to re-phrasings
that are equivalent in meaning - such as “NYC" and “New York City," or “Daoism" and “Taoism".
LLM grading can also penalize answers that are overly verbose or use a different meaning of the
same word, potentially containing incorrect answers along with the correct string. For example, if the
question is “What’s it called when you move quickly by foot and both feet aren’t always touching the
ground?” and the LLM response is “A bank run", the grader should be able to distinguish that this is
semantically dissimilar to the true answer “run”.

In this paper, we utilize GPT 3.5 Turbo as the auxiliary grading model. When comparing many
possible grading methods on subsets of MMLU, we find that GPT 3.5 Turbo has high agreement with
humans while being cost efficient (Appendix A.3).

Grading prompt (G)

The problem is: Q
The correct answer is: A
A student submitted: ˆ
A

The student’s answer must be correct and
specific but not overcomplete (for example, if they
provide two different answers, they did not get
the question right). However, small differences in
formatting should not be penalized (for example,
‘New York City’ is equivalent to ‘NYC’). Did
the student provide an equivalent answer to the
ground truth? Please answer yes or no without any
explanation: C </s>

Figure 7: For open-ended generation, we calculate the ground-truth correctness C using a LLM and a
grading prompt (G). The token </s> is an end-of-sentence token. Blue text is included in the loss
function when calibration-tuning.

A.3
Comparison of Grading Techniques

We conducted an analysis of the methods outlined in Appendix A.1 for open-ended evaluation. First,
the base LLaMA-2 13b-chat model was prompted with questions from the following test subsets of
MMLU: World Religions, Philosophy, Anatomy, High School Chemistry and Elementary School
Math. The questions were stripped of their multiple-choice options before being supplied to the
model.

16


---Page Break---
A response was generated by the model via greedy decoding and this response was compared to the
ground truth answer. The grading methods tested were Human, Substring Match, GPT 3.5 Turbo,
and GPT 4.

The humans (a subset of our authors) were tasked to judge if the model response was essentially
equivalent to the ground truth. For substring match, equivalence was determined by simply checking
whether the ground truth answer existed as a substring within the model response. For GPT 3.5
Turbo and GPT 4, the models were supplied with the question, the ground truth, and the base model
response, as well as a prompt indicating they should determine essential equivalence - see Figure 7.

Table 2: Absolute differences in accuracy % for the different grading methods vs human estimated
accuracy. A lower value corresponds to an accuracy estimate closer to the human estimate.

We recorded the binary decision on correctness for each query and response by each of the grading
methods above. Taking the human scores as the gold standard of correctness, we computed the model
accuracy for each subset, and then derived the absolute error in estimate of model accuracy by each
of the other grading methods. These are displayed in Table 2. We see that GPT4 is a better estimator
of human-judged correctness than GPT 3.5 Turbo, which in turn is substantially better than substring
match; although there is some variance on a per-subset basis. For expediency of processing time and
cost, we chose to use GPT 3.5 Turbo in this paper.

Metrics

ECE
Given N samples and B equally-spaced bins bj, examples are assigned to bins based on the
confidence of the model, and ECE is estimated as d
ECE = PB
j=1
|bj|

N |conf(bj) −acc(bj)| where
conf(bj) is the average confidence of samples in bin bj, acc(bj) is the accuracy within the bin, and
|bj| is the number of samples assigned to bin j. In our experiments conf is equivalent to P(correct).

A.5
MMLU Supercategory Classifier

To understand the impact of the subject matter of the training data on generalization, we follow
the prescription of Hendrycks et al. [18] and categorize each of the 57 tasks into one of four
supercategories - Humanities, STEM, Social Sciences, and Other. Since we do not have such a
categorization for the training set, we must estimate their proportions.

First, we use the OpenAI embeddings (dimension 1536) of the MMLU samples with their ground
truth supercategories to train a linear 4-way classifier with 10 samples from each of the 57 tasks.
We use AdamW [34] with learning rate 1e-3 and weight decay 1e-2. This classifier is then used to
estimate the categories of each sample in the training set used for fine-tuning. Subsequently, the
breakdown of results in Figure 4 (Left) follows.

B
Baseline Methods

B.1
Sampling Methods

We use two baselines which obtain an estimate of certainty by sampling the same answers n = 10
times and then estimating the proportion of sampled answers that agree with the greedily decoded
“main" answer. There are several critical downsides to these approaches: (i) the uncertainty here
depends on the sampling parameters—for example, in the limit where the sampling converges to mere
greedy decoding, the LLM will produce n identical samples, and therefore the certainty will always
be 1—(ii) these approaches require O(n) answer generations to provide a certainty estimate for a

17


---Page Break---
single generation. The intense computational restriction prevents us from easily searching the space
of sampling parameters for the optimal set, so we choose parameters arbitrarily; here we sample with
top_p = 0.95.

Counting
In this baseline, each sampled answer is compared to the greedy answer by prompting an
expert LLM with both answers and asking it to judge their equivalence. The proportion of samples
that are equivalent to the greedy answer is the certainty estimate. This baseline is similar to Label
prob [51]; our method differs by not choosing the argmax semantic group as the final prediction,
but instead using the greedy decode for the final prediction, so as to maintain the same accuracy
performance as our uncertainty query method. This met

Likelihood accumulation
In this baseline, we add up likelihoods of sampled answers to estimate
the mass associated with the predicted answer. We begin by prompting an expert LLM in order
to find which sampled answers are equivalent to the greedy answer—like in the counting baseline.
In this method, the certainty estimate is produced by adding the length-normalized likelihoods of
those sampled answers equivalent to the greedy answer, and dividing this quantity by the sum of all
sampled answers’ length-normalized likelihoods. This procedure of adding likelihoods of samples
in order to estimate the likelihood of an equivalence class is similar to that used by [30], although
they do not use it for certainty estimates but instead to produce entropy scores. In practice, the scores
produced by these two methods are actually very similar—so we report only likelihood accumulation
numbers in the main text.

B.2
Verbal Elicitation

Although Tian et al. [51] introduce several strategies for prompting, involving multiple guesses or
multiple stages of interleaving prompting and generation, we did not find that any strategy consistently
outperformed any other. This finding was consistent with the results of Xiong et al. [60]. Ultimately,
for convenience, we adopted a two stage strategy with a single guess because it can be used in tandem
with logged datasets of generated answers per model.

The exact prompt we used is essentially the same at in [51], but with small modifications that
improved the rate of correctly formatted responses:

“Provide the probability that your answer is correct. Give ONLY the probability,
no other words or explanation.

For example:

Probability: <the probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that your guess is correct, without
any extra commentary whatsoever; just the probability!>

Include probability for the answer below: Probability:”

Verbal elicitation methods typically output complex strings containing both answers and associated
probabilities. This means that if any element of parsing fails, it can be challenging to construct
partial results. This effect tends to diminish when using large models, which are more responsive to
zero-shot prompting.

Parsing Details
The original verbal elicitation prompts are given in the appendix of [51]. However,
it is not clear how the original authors decide to parse answers from the generations and how failure
to parse is handled. When we fail to parse the guess from the generation we return an empty string
and associated probability 0.5. When we fail to parse a probability, we also return probability 0.5.
For versions with multiple guesses, if any part of the parsing processes fails in an ambiguous way, we
default back to an empty string for the answer and 0.5 for the probability. The only unambiguous
cases are those which explicit succeed in the generating a valid guess and probability in the first case
but not subsequent cases. In this scenario, we default to using the successfully parse first guess and
associated probability.

C
Fine-tuning Method

C.1
Regularization Term

To keep the calibration-tuned parameters θ within the neighborhood of the initial parameters, θ0, we
use a regularization term that penalizes the divergence between the original sampling distribution and
the calibration-tuned model on the target sequence A, yielding regularization R(θ; θ0), which we use
with weighting parameter κ.

Specifically, let pθ0 be the language modeling distribution of the language model we
wish to calibration-tune,
and qθ
be the corresponding language modeling distribution
as a consequence of calibration-tuning.
We then use the Jensen-Shannon Divergence
JSD(pθ0 ∥qθ) [35] between the two language modeling distributions as the regularizer, where
JSD(p ∥q) ≜1/2(KL(p ∥m) + KL(q ∥m)), where m ≜1/2(p + q) is the mixture distribution.
JSD regularization is applied only to the logits corresponding to the target sequence A.

We note that using either direction of KL-divergence, i.e. the forward-KL KL(pθ0 ∥qθ) or reverse-
KL KL(qθ ∥pθ0) was insufficient for optimal performance with calibration tuning. The forward
KL-divergence encourages a zero-avoiding behavior such that the mass of qθ is spread across multiple
modes of pθ0 to minimize the KL-divergence to avoid assigning no mass to regions of the probability
space. To the contrary, the reverse KL-divergence encourages a zero-forcing behavior such the qθ only
needs to cover any one mode of pθ0 [6]. It is not necessarily obvious which one of these behaviors
one should prefer for the specific case of large language models. Therefore, as a practical choice, we
pick the one that provides us the most performant calibration-tuned model.

C.2
Training Data

We reserve the following datasets for training.

• AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) [12],
• Boolean Questions (BoolQ) [11],
• CommonsenseQA [47],
• CosmosQA [21],
• HellaSwag [62],
• MathQA [2],

• Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension (MultiRC) [27],
• Choice of Plausible Alternatives (CoPA) [16],
• TREC [31],
• Adversarial Winograd (Winogrande) [45].

C.3
Training Hyperparameters

We use HuggingFace Transformers [59] and PyTorch [41] for the implementation of these models.
For all our experiments, we use the AdamW optimizer [34] with a learning rate of 10−4, a cosine
decay schedule, and effective batch size M = 32. The training runs for G = 10000 with an initial
linear warmup schedule for 1000 steps.

E
Confidence as a Function of Target Length

As we noted when motivating calibration tuning, one limitation of sequence-level probabilities is
their intrinsic connection to sequence length. The probability of a sequence decreases with increasing
length, regardless of the correctness of the response. By contrast, we wouldn’t expect concept-level
probabilities to have any discernible relationship with sequence length. In Appendix E, we show

after temperature scaling on a small hold-out set of the original dataset mixture Appendix C.2. Acc is
task accuracy (proportion of coding solutions that are correct). Supervised training (LoRA + Prompt)
seems to always improve selective prediction, although supervised training only heavily improves
calibration for Mistral-7B and in fact slightly degrades calibration for the two other models.

there is no consistent relationship between the confidence estimated by the calibration-tuned model
and target sequence length on MMLU tasks.

A key limitation of using token likelihoods is that they necessarily decay with the length of the
generation. In Figures 12 to 14, we confirm over all subsets of MMLU that the length of the target
does not strongly correlate with the confidence associated with the targets. This behavior is an
essential ingredient towards an effective confidence estimation in practice, such that longer sequences
are not penalized in confidence despite being correct.

F
Generalization to Coding Tasks

Because there are no coding tasks in our training dataset, we can use a coding competition task
introduced in LiveCodeBench [22] to assess how well finetuned uncertainty estimation methods
perform on completely out of distribution tasks.

To conduct the analysis in Table 3, we evaluate several base models on the 62 LeetCode easy questions
from the livecodebench_generation_lite task. We asking for the model to write a Python solution
and grade the solution using test cases (marking it as correct iff it passes all test cases). We then
apply Lora + Prompt and Zero-Shot Classifier uncertainty estimation methods—with
these methods only using training/temperature scaling data from our main dataset mixture which
notably does not include any coding tasks Appendix C.2. Accuracy is shown to contextualize
the model’s overall level of performance on the task. On Mistral-7B, the best performing model
on the coding task, the supervised Lora + Prompt approach dramatically improves calibration
and selective prediction as compared to Zero-Shot Classifier; on the worse-performing
Mistral-7B-Instruct and LLaMa-2-7B, selective prediction improves but calibration slightly degrades.

User Studies

Additional Details on Setup

Stimuli and Participant Selection
We closely followed the setup of [5]. We used the same 180
MMLU questions from which were pre-batched into three sets of 60 MMLU questions. Within
each variant, we randomly assigned participants to one of the three batches. In total, we recruit 181
participants (20 per variant4). All participants were recruited through the crowdsourcing platform
Prolific [40]; we restrict our participant pool to those based in the United States who speak English
as a first language.

Compensation
Participants were told that the study would take approximately 30 minutes and
were paid at a base rate of $9/hr and informed that they would receive an optional bonus up to $10
for answering questions correctly. We applied the bonus to all participants.

4With the exception of one extra participant due to random batching allocation effects.

LLM Answers and Uncertainty Elicitation
Bhatt et al. originally used GPT-3.5 as their LLM.
While at first, we explored user performance when provided with confidence scores modulated
over the original GPT-3.5 responses that the authors had collected, the authors had filtered LLM
performance to ensure the LLM achieved high performance on biology, computer science, and foreign
policy and poor performance on mathematics. As such, we noticed that participants overwhelmingly
uptook the LLM’s answer (which was rational behaviour, given the model’s high performance). To
explore a more nuanced performance profile, we regenerated LLM answers using Mistral 7B Instruct
via greedy decoding. We then generated confidence scores on top of the LLM responses. For our
random baseline, we sample a confidence score uniformly between 0 and 100% for each question.

G.2
Important considerations

There are many reasons to heed caution in interpreting our results as definitive indications of the utility
of displaying confidence to users in LLM assistive settings. In particular: (i) users are presented with
feedback after each trial as in [5] – as such, they can determine (potentially rapidly) whether or not a
model is reliable, even without confidence scores. However, in practical settings users may not know
whether or not the model was truly correct and therefore confidence scores could have an even larger
impact; (ii) MMLU questions can be challenging for non-experts – we see the biggest differences in
performance for the no-LLM vs. any-LLM-assistance condition. We may see a wider range of reliance
behaviors in settings wherein people have more confidence in their own abilities; (iii) we present
users with numeric confidence; however, humans are not always able to reliably process confidence
estimates nor appropriately calibrate uncertainty estimates themselves [26, 56, 13, 32]. It may be that
alternate modes of communicating confidence improve users’ ability to appropriately leverage the
confidence scores in their decision making process. We see targeted exploration of each component
through interdisciplinary collaboration across AI, behavioral science, and human-computer interaction
as ripe for future work.

G.3
Extended Results

Task Accuracy and Reliance Sensibility
We depict average user task accuracy and reliance
sensibility across variants in Figure 15. We follow Bhatt et al. in computing reliance sensibility as
the proportion of times the user appropriately sided with the model prediction when the model was
correct and did not respond with the model’s prediction when the model was incorrect.

We depict per-topic accuracy, with the LLM’s average performance in Figure 16.

GPT-3.5 Confidence Generalization
As noted, we ran variants using the same GPT-3.5 generations
as [5]. We show aggregate and per-topic accuracy in Figure 17, as well as reliance sensibility in
Figure 18.

Freeform User Responses
We permitted users to provide freeform responses at the end of the
study. Some users were sensitive to confidence scores being reported and came up with their own
heuristics for whether to rely on the model’s output. We include a sampling of comments across
confidence variants:

• “if it had a confidence of less than 50% it made me very skeptical.”

• “The model´s confidence indeed helped me choose and select my answer as I trusted in them
most of the time.”

• “I didn´t really rely on the confidence level. If I had 0 confidence in the answer myself I
relied on the AI regardless.”

• “if the models confidence fell below 45 I decided to investigate it myself by remembering
pieces of information. and also reasoning the question. If it was above 45 I would automati-
cally agree to its prediction but there were some few cases I challenged it even though it
was above 45”

• “At first I was hesistant to trust the model much because of the lower confidence levels but
I still trusted it enough on topics I struggled with. As it went on, I was comfortable with
confidence levels above 40.”

Interface and Instructions

We show a sample interface of our extension of Modiste with user confidence in Figure 19, and
present the the full set of instructions provided to users in Figures 20 and 21. Note, for the LLM-only
and no-LLM conditions, we followed the instruction text from [5] directly, i.e., participants who
saw only the LLM did not see the instruction page about model confidence, and participants in the
“No-LLM” variant were not instructed about any model variant and were just instructed to answer
the questions as best as they could by themselves. Participants also responded to a post survey
questionarre after completing the user study, which we depict in Figure 22.

H
Broader Impact and Implications

The goal of this work is to make LLM outputs have better confidence values associated with
them. With successful, calibrated confidence values, the machine systems ultimately become more
interpretable and trustworthy by a user [23]. When applied correctly, our advancements will help
users be able to make decisions based off of LLM outputs in a more informed way. Similar examples
in other domains, like AlphaFold [49], have shown how well-calibrated confidence scores can be
useful in complex decision-making domains. Our hope is to replicate those broad findings in LLMs.

We acknowledge the ongoing debate over the appropriateness, limitations, and harms of LLMs.
We do highlight that the development of more confident, interpretable, and trustworthy LLMs can
lead to continued techno-solutionism in unintended applications. Specifically, we highlight that our
work is limited to use-cases with fact-based questions. Many applications of text-based LLMs are
generative, meaning that there is no way for our paradigm to be applied appropriately, and the use of
a confidences from calibration-tuned models could be misleading or damaging without checks and
guardrails. Additionally, even within the fact-based paradigm, what is true can be subjective, with
ground truth in machine learning being a contested topic [3, 55].

The philosophical debate on these topics is beyond the expertise of the authors; nonetheless, we
believe that the ongoing debate over the appropriateness of LLMs should be considered in context
with the benefits of our approach in making LLMs more interpretable and useful.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe and link all claims in Section 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide a discussion on the limitations in Section 8.

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

35


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the complete code, and the complete list of datasets used for all
experiments in Section 5 to reproduce all our experiments with instructions. All hyperpa-
rameters are described in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

36


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the complete code, and the complete list of datasets used for
all experiments in Appendix C.2 to reproduce all our experiments with instructions. All
hyperparameters are described in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the complete code, and the complete list of datasets used for
all experiments in Appendix C.2 to reproduce all our experiments with instructions. All
hyperparameters are described in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All figures are appropriately labeled with the error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

37


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide an estimate of the compute resources required in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have read the ethics guidelines
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide a broader impact statement in Appendix H
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

38


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We train on open-access models with open-source datasets. We do not change
their generation behavior, and all existing safeguards (if any) remain.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We explicitly cite all models in Section 5. All datasets used are listed and cited
in Appendix C.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.

39


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We release our trained models for easy use via Hugging Face.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide screenshots of our instructions, as well as details of compensation
in Appendix G.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We received prior approval from our respective institutional ethics review body
for our user study. All users provided consent before partaking in the study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
