Abstract

The domain adaptation method effectively mitigates the negative impact of domain
gaps on the performance of super-resolution (SR) networks through the guidance
of numerous target domain low-resolution (LR) images. However, in real-world
scenarios, the availability of target domain LR images is often limited, sometimes
even to just one, which inevitably impairs the domain adaptation performance
of SR networks. We propose Instance-guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for
Super-Resolution (IODA) to enable efficient domain adaptation with only a single
unlabeled target domain LR image. To address the limited diversity of the target
domain distribution caused by a single target domain LR image, we propose
an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. This strategy
effectively expands the diversity of the target domain distribution by generating
instance-specific features focused on different instances within the image. For SR
tasks emphasizing texture details, we propose an image-guided domain adaptation
method. Compared to existing methods that use text representation for domain
difference, this method utilizes pixel-level representation with higher granularity,
enabling efficient domain adaptation guidance for SR networks. Finally, we validate
the effectiveness of IODA on multiple datasets and various network architectures,
achieving satisfactory one-shot domain adaptation for SR networks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ZaizuoTang/IODA.

Introduction

Figure 1: Performance improvement by IODA.
The performance of the real-world pre-trained
weights (from DF2K dataset [1]) provided in the
original paper serves as the baseline on the real-
world dataset RealSR_Canon [2].

Super-resolution (SR) has significant practical
value in various fields, including remote sens-
ing imagery [3, 4, 5], the restoration of old
films [6, 7], and even as a preprocessing strat-
egy to enhance downstream tasks such as ob-
ject detection [8, 9, 10] and image segmentation
[11, 12, 13]. However, SR also faces domain
gap issues, where the performance of networks
significantly declines when the distribution of
test low-resolution (LR) images differs from that
of the training LR images [14]. Therefore, do-
main adaptation methods for SR [14, 15] have
emerged. These methods represent training LR
images as the source domain and test LR images

as the target domain, then use generative adversarial networks to align the two domains during
adaptation training, mitigating the negative impact of domain gaps on network performance. (Refer
to Appendix A.2 for related work on SR network.)

However, the methods mentioned above require a large number of target domain LR images for
training the generative adversarial network alignment. In some special scenarios, such as photos
taken by users or uploaded to the internet, users often provide only a small amount or even a single
LR image for SR, rendering the aforementioned methods inapplicable.

In other tasks such as image generation [16, 17, 18, 19], semantic segmentation [20], and object
detection [21], one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods have emerged (collectively referred to as
text-guided domain adaptation, Appendix B). These methods use text descriptions to guide domain
adaptation, inputting the text descriptions of the source and target domains into the CLIP model [22]
to compute the text domain difference, namely the text cross-domain direction vector. Subsequently,
the predicted target domain images and source domain images are input into the CLIP model to
generate the image cross-domain direction vector. By constraining the target domain generation
model to align the image cross-domain direction vector with the text cross-domain direction vector,
these methods achieve domain adaptation with one/zero-shot learning. (Refer to Appendix A.1 for
related work on one/zero-shot domain adaptation.)

However, when it comes to the SR task, one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods have not yet been
explored. If existing one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods are directly applied to the SR task,
they will encounter the following two issues:

• Text descriptions lack fine granularity, which prevents accurate and comprehensive represen-
tation of domain differences in image texture details, thereby failing to provide effective
guidance for domain adaptation in the SR task.

• The diversity of the target domain distribution is limited. Existing one/zero-shot domain
adaptation methods typically sample latent vectors from random noise for subsequent image
generation, enriching the target domain distribution through multiple samplings. However,
for the SR task, the target domain consists of only a single LR image, resulting in a limited
diversity of target domain distribution, which increases the risk of pattern collapse during
training.

To address the first issue, this paper proposes an image-guided domain adaptation method that
transforms the existing text-level description of domain differences between source and target domains
into a pixel-level description of domain differences in LR images. This approach achieves a high
level of granularity in representing image texture details, effectively guiding domain adaptation for
SR networks. Regarding the second issue, we propose an instance-guided target domain distribution
expansion strategy. By enabling Alpha-CLIP [23] to generate instance-specific features, the diversity
of the target domain feature distribution is effectively expanded through the diversity of instances in
the image.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying a one-shot domain adaptation method in
the SR task. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We propose an image-guided domain adaptation method to address the issue of incomplete
image texture detail representation in existing text-guided domain adaptation methods.

• We propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy to address the
issue of limited target domain distribution diversity caused by one-shot scenarios.

• We introduce a novel one-shot domain adaptation method for the SR task. This method
utilizes a single LR image from the target domain, effectively alleviating the negative impact
of domain gaps on the performance of SR networks.

• We propose a plug-and-play domain adaptation method for SR task, which demonstrates
good robustness for different data distributions and network architectures.

Proposed method

2.1
Problem setting

Given a source domain dataset DSource = {LRSource
i
, HRSource
i
}Ns
i=1, a target domain dataset
DT arget = {LRT arget
i
, HRT arget
i
}Nt
i=1, a source domain SR network MS trained solely on the
source domain dataset, and a target domain SR network MT initialized by MS. The problem
addressed in this paper is to adjust the network MT (one-shot domain adaptation) using only a single
LR image LRT arget
i−th
from the target domain dataset DT arget (without a corresponding HR image
HRT arget
i−th
as a label), aiming to achieve better performance of the adjusted network MT on the target
domain dataset DT arget compared to the source domain network MS. Notably, the target domain
HR images HRT arget are used only for performance testing after the domain adaptation training is
complete and are not visible to the network during domain adaptation training.

2.2
Overview

Figure 2: Overall framework

As shown in Figure 2, IODA is primarily divided into two stages. In the first stage, the SR network
MS is pre-trained using the source domain dataset DSource. In the second stage, domain adaptation
is performed on the SR network. Firstly, the weight of the pre-trained SR network MS is frozen
and used to initialize the target domain SR network MT . Subsequently, using LR images from the
source domain LRSource and target domain LRT arget
i−th
, as well as SR images from the source domain
SRSource and target domain SRT arget
i−th
, we compute SR and LR cross-domain direction vectors in
the Alpha-CLIP space. The Ldirection loss is calculated to align these two cross-domain direction
vectors, enabling domain adaptation training for the target domain SR network MT . The focus of
this paper is on the second stage: domain adaptation of the SR network, corresponding to Sections
2.3-2.4. Subsequent sections will not delve into the details of the first stage, which aligns with the
training methods employed in the original papers [24, 25, 26].

2.3
Image-guided domain adaptation

Existing text-guided domain adaptation methods seek the text cross-domain direction vector by
comparing the domain difference between the source domain text description and the target domain
text description (“cat”and“dog”, as shown in Appendix B). However, text description cannot capture
the domain differences in the texture details between the source and target domains, such as the
orange short fur of a cat versus the black long fur of a dog, or the pink nose of a cat versus the
black nose of a dog. In the SR task, texture details are extremely critical. The SR network needs to
finely reconstruct texture details such as fur, eyes, and nose. Moreover, the commonly used PSNR
performance metric is also calculated at the pixel level. Therefore, existing text-guided domain
adaptation methods are not suitable for SR tasks (Table 2). We aim to develop a domain difference
representation method with higher granularity.

---Page Break---
Figure 3: Image-guided domain adaptation method. This figure depicts the second stage of domain
adaptation. MS and MT represent the source domain SR network and the target domain SR network,
respectively.

When it comes to representing texture details, images are superior to text because they can depict
texture detail features at the pixel level. Compared to the network’s perception of differences between
two words, the differences between images are more fine-grained and contain more detailed features.
Additionally, the SR processing does not alter the image’s content information. The cross-domain
direction from the source domain to the target domain in LR images should also be followed in
SR images (aligned with it). Specifically, in the LR image space, if transitioning from a cat image
in the source domain to a dog image in the target domain, then after image SR processing, this
transformation rule should also be followed: transitioning from a cat image in the source domain
to a dog image in the target domain. Therefore, we propose an image-guided domain adaptation
method (Figure 3), which utilizes the LR images from the source and target domains to determine the
domain differences. This method has pixel-level domain difference representation, providing higher
granularity and more efficient domain adaptation guidance for SR network.

As shown in Figure 3, image-guided domain adaptation directly uses the CLIP model to learn the
LR image cross-domain direction vector ∆LR between the source domain LR image LRSource and
the target domain LR image LRT arget
i−th
. Simultaneously, it computes the SR image cross-domain
direction vector ∆SR between the source domain SR image SRSource and the target domain SR
image SRT arget
i−th
. By imposing collinearity constraints on these two cross-domain direction vectors,
it enables domain adaptation training for the target domain SR network,

∆LR = EI(LRT arget
i−th
) −EI(LRSource),
(1)

∆SR = EI(MT (LRT arget
i−th
)) −EI(MS(LRSource)),
(2)

Ldirection = 1 −
∆LR · ∆SR
|∆LR| · |∆SR|,
(3)

EI represents the image encoder of CLIP [22].

2.4
Instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy

The one/zero-shot domain adaptation method of the generation network can construct the diversity
distribution of the target domain (latent vectors) by multiple sampling from random noise (Appendix
B). However, for the SR task, it is not possible to sample from random noise, as there is only one
target domain LR image available. Although randomly cropping subregions from a single target
domain LR image can slightly increase the diversity of the target domain distribution (as shown in
Figure 4a), the diversity of the target domain distribution is still limited. These limitations increase
the risk of pattern collapse during domain adaptation training, negatively impacting the efficiency of
domain adaptation.

dispersed the scatter plot distribution, the more diverse the target domain feature distribution.

target domain SR images SRSource, SRT arget

Inspired by MAE [28], we intend to introduce occlusion masks to randomly mask the cropped target
domain LR images and use the masked LR images for domain adaptation training of the target
domain SR network. This method enhances the diversity of the target domain distribution through
the randomness of the occlusion masks (as shown in Figure 4b).

Although occlusion masks increase the diversity of target domain distribution to some extent, we aim
to further expand the extent of this increasement. Recently, Alpha-CLIP [23] (as shown in Appendix
C) has received widespread attention for its ability to enhance CLIP [22] by incorporating specified
attention regions. By providing Alpha-CLIP with a region-range mask, the network can focus more
on the specified area. Motivated by this, we intend to provide Alpha-CLIP with different region-range
masks each time, enabling it to generate Alpha-CLIP spatial features focused on different areas of the
image, thereby expanding the diversity of the target domain distribution.

For the generation strategy of region-range masks, benefiting from the powerful performance of the
SAM model [29], which has good generalization and can accurately segment each instance in arbitrary
scene images. SAM is used to generate region-range masks, corresponding to each instance in the
image. Specifically, we use region-range masks generated by SAM to enable Alpha-CLIP to focus on
different instances when generating multiple Alpha-CLIP spatial features (instance-specific features).
For example, in Figure 5, features could focus on the leaves, the first bird, the second bird, and so on.
In addition, compared to naively randomly generating rectangular region masks, instance-specific
masks implicitly convey semantic information, exhibiting better domain adaptation efficiency (Table
3). As shown in Figure 4c, the introduction of Alpha-CLIP equipped with region-range mask further
enhances the diversity of the target domain distribution.

As shown in Figure 5, we replace the CLIP image encoder with the Alpha-CLIP image encoder.
Firstly, we use the SAM model to perform instance segmentation on the target domain LR image,
obtaining a collection of instance masks, denoted as MaskALL ∈{maski}NM
i=1. Randomly select a
certain number of masks from the mask collection to concatenate and generate region-range mask
MaskSelect. The target domain LR images with added occlusion mask and region-range mask
MaskSelect are input into the image encoder of Alpha-CLIP to generate Alpha-CLIP spatial features.
For the region-range mask of the target domain SR image, to maintain consistency with the focused
region of the target domain LR image, the upsampled region-range mask is used for SR image. For
the source domain HR and LR images HRSource, LRSource, due to their abundant quantity, there is
no need to focus on individual instances in the image with Alpha-CLIP. Therefore, the region-range
mask covering the entire image is used as input.

Experiments

3.1
Experiment details

The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed IODA method using the RealSR [2],
DF2K [1], GTA [30], Cityscapes [31], and ACDC [32] datasets. Specifically, the GTA, Cityscapes,
and ACDC datasets utilize downsampling methods from BasicSR [33] to generate paired LR images.
For pre-trained weights, the original papers provided the real-world pre-trained weights of the SR
networks (HAT [24], SRFormer [25], SAFMN [26]) on the DF2K dataset. For other datasets like
GTA and Cityscapes, we conduct pre-training on these datasets using the provided source code (as
explained in the table notes). For the experimental devices, a 2080ti GPU is utilized for domain
adaptation training of the SFAMN and SRFormer networks. Due to the larger memory demands of
the HAT network, a V100 GPU is employed as the training device. For experimental data selection,
we select a single LR image from the target domain dataset for network one-shot domain adaptation
training. The entire target domain dataset is used as the test set for evaluating network performance.
It is worth noting that to mitigate the uncertainty in network performance caused by random sample
selection, we repeat the IODA-related experiments five times. Each time, a different single sample is
selected from the target domain dataset for adaptation training, and the results are presented as mean
and variance.

As shown in Table 1, with the introduction of image-guided domain adaptation (Image-guided),
guiding the SR network through the cross-domain direction vector between LR images in the source
and target domains resulted in improvements of 2.19 in PSNR and 0.029 in SSIM performance metrics.
Furthermore, with the introduction of the instance-guided target domain distribution expansion
strategy (Image-guided & Diversity strategy), the diversity of the target domain distribution was
further expanded, improving network performance with an increase in PSNR by 0.447 and SSIM by
0.017. Additionally, as shown in Appendix D Figure 8 and Figure 9, our proposed method effectively
alleviates the negative impact of domain gaps on network performance.

Ablation experiments on image-guided domain adaptation

As shown in Table 2, we validated a text-guided domain adaptation method (Text Guided) similar to
[20, 19]. In this experiments, for a clearer and more consistent representation of domain differences,
we employed domain adaptation from GTA (game scenes) to Cityscapes (real scenes), with text
descriptions "driving in a game" and "driving" (same as [20]). However, the collinearity constraints
from text are not suitable for tasks like SR that require high-detail fidelity. They are ineffective in
expressing cross-domain directions, thus unable to achieve domain adaptation for SR.

Furthermore, during domain adaptation, replacing the SR images SRSource generated by the source
domain SR network with real HR images HRSource was performed to verify whether more accurate
HR images would provide greater performance improvements (Real HR). However, compared to
using predicted generated SR images (Image-Guided & SR), the domain adaptation network using
real HR images exhibited a decrease in PSNR performance by 0.304. This indicates that using real
HR images causes the target domain network to lose information from the source domain network
during domain adaptation, lacking the explicit constraints of the source domain network. Besides
retaining some source domain information through target domain weight initialization, no information
about the source domain network is acquired during domain adaptation training. Using SRSource
generated by source domain network can implement explicit constraints of the source domain network
on the target domain network, demonstrating better domain adaptation efficiency.

dataset and RealSR_Canon [2] as the target domain dataset, with the SAFMN network architecture

Ablation experiments on diversity strategies

As shown in Table 3, we also conducted extensive ablation experiments in the diversity strategy.
Inspired by MAE [28], we directly added random occlusion masks to the images (Occlusion Mask).
Furthermore, we conducted ablation experiments on the shape of region-range mask in the Alpha-
CLIP network, including random grid region-range mask (Region-range Mask -G), single random-
sized region-range mask (Region-range Mask -B), and instance region-range masks (Region-range
Mask -I). From Table 3, it can be observed that instance region-range masks implicitly convey
semantic information, leading to better domain adaptation performance compared to randomly
generated region-range masks. Finally, we combined the instance region-range masks with random
occlusion masking (Occlution Mask + Region-range Mask -I). From Figure 4c and Table 3, it can be
observed that the proposed method effectively improved the diversity of target domain distribution
and significantly enhanced the performance of the network on the target domain dataset, with a PSNR
improvement of 0.447.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Instance-guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for SR (IODA), which
enables efficient domain adaptation with only a single unlabeled target domain LR image. IODA
introduces an image-guided domain adaptation method that is more effective in enforcing constraints
on texture details compared to existing text-guided domain adaptation methods. Additionally, we
propose the instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. This strategy utilizes the
diversity of instances in images to expand the diversity of domain distribution, effectively enhancing
the performance of one-shot domain adaptation.

Limitation: Although the proposed method effectively mitigates the negative impact of the domain
gap on SR network performance, domain adaptation training still requires a relatively long time (over
ten minutes), which is not user-friendly for individuals who only need to super resolution of a single
photo. In the future, we plan to further optimize the speed of domain adaptation, for example, by
refining the selection of parameters related to network domain adaptation.

A.1
One/Zero-shot domain adaptation

Luo et al. [21] conducted research on zero-shot domain adaptation of object detection networks from
daytime to nighttime scenes. They utilized data augmentation to maximize the distance between
daytime and nighttime input images while minimizing the differences in features within the backbone
network, thereby enhancing the network’s robustness to variations in image brightness. GAL et al.
[19] were the first to integrate the CLIP network [22] into the Style-GAN [39] image generation model
for zero-shot domain adaptation. They proposed a text-guided image generation network domain
adaptation method, leveraging the robustness of the CLIP network in open-world scenarios to guide
network adaptation from the source domain to the target domain using text descriptions. Furthermore,
GAL et al.[19] proposed a strategy for selecting fine-tuning layers. During the network adaptation
towards the target domain, specific layers are adjusted based on the magnitude of weight changes
to enhance the stability of network domain adaptation. Kim et al. replaced the StyleGAN network
in the StyleGAN-NADA method with the diffusion network [40], proposing DiffusionCLIP [41],
which achieved better performance. Guo et al. [16] argued that StyleGAN-NADA and DiffusionCLIP
identify all images using a single text description, leading to overly uniform directions in domain
adaptation and potential pattern collapse issues. Therefore, they proposed a specific text descriptor
prediction module that individually predicts a specific text description for each source domain
image, effectively reducing the risk of pattern collapse. To increase the diversity of domain transfer
directions, Jeon et al. [17] proposed a perturbation strategy where noise is artificially added during
text feature extraction, along with an orthogonal constraint to reduce the redundancy of the noise.
Additionally, Jeon et al. [17] argued that specifying certain layers for fine-tuning in StyleGAN-NADA
is unreasonable, because the remaining layers also contribute to the network’s predictions in the target
domain. Therefore, they introduced an EWC [42] (Elastic Weight Consolidation) regularization term
to fine-tune all layers of the network, but with constraints on the range of weight changes to avoid
excessive adjustments. Fahes et al.[20] proposed the zero-shot domain adaptation method P0DA
for semantic segmentation. Its core was a text-guided feature augmentation module. This allowed
the augmentation module to augment source domain features according to the text description of
the target domain, obtaining features that approximated the target domain distribution. As a result,
during training, the network gained the ability to handle target domain feature distributions.

A.2
Super resolution network

Dong et al.[43] was the first to introduce neural networks into the SR task, achieving end-to-end SR.
Liang et al.[38] constructed a multi-expert system where each expert was intended to handle image
information within different degraded subspace. Through cooperation among multiple experts, the
system was capable of processing image information across the entire degradation space. Liang et
al.[37] introduced Swin-Transformer [44] into the SR network, which effectively alleviated issues
such as patch boundary artifacts and limited receptive fields with patches, using a sliding window
approach. HAT [24] further enhanced the feature correlation between windows in SwinIR by
introducing Overlapping Cross-Attention Blocks (OCAB) to enhance feature interactions between
adjacent windows. Additionally, they combined channel attention with self-attention methods to
activate more pixels for SR reconstruction, further improving its SR performance.

Although Transformer [45] could bring significant performance improvements to SR networks, the
computational burden it imposed was considerable. Therefore, Zhang et al. [46] first employed shift
convolution to extract local structural information from images while maintaining complexity similar
to 1x1 convolutions. Then, they introduced group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA) modules,
which used different window sizes to compute self-attention on non-overlapping feature groups. By
cascading shift convolution with GMSA modules, ELAN effectively enhanced the processing speed of
existing Transformer-based SR networks. Zhou et al. [25] aimed to reduce the computational burden
of networks using large-scale window self-attention. Its core concept was permuted self-attention
(PSA), which reduced the channel dimension of the key and value matrices and then incorporated
spatial information into the channel dimension. This approach effectively prevented the loss of spatial
information while reducing the number of channels. Sun et al. [26] split features along the channel
dimension and extracted these split features at different downsampling ratios, enabling the network
to have a larger receptive field while effectively reducing computational cost.

A.3
Domain Adaptation Methods in SR

The feature distribution differences between the training and test sets led to significant performance
degradation of SR networks that performed well on the training set when evaluated on the test set. To
address this issue, test-time domain-adaptive SR networks [34],[47],[48],[49],[50] were introduced,
treating the training set as the source domain and the test set as the target domain. During inference
on the target domain, the network simulated the degradation experienced by target domain LR images
to generate additional training samples. Training the network with these simulated samples, which
approximated the target domain’s degradation, effectively reduced the negative impact of distribution
discrepancies on network performance.

Shocher et al. [34] can be seen as a test-time domain-adaptive SR network. During inference,
it performed Bicubic downsampling on target domain LR images to generate pseudo-LR images,
simulating the degradation of the target domain LR images. It then used paired target domain LR
and pseudo-LR images for supervised training, achieving super-resolution without requiring labels
for target domain HR images. Soh et al. [47] suggested that the ZSSR [34] network repeatedly
performed domain adaptation training from the random initial weights, leading to long training times.
Therefore, they attempted to find a universal initial weight parameter to reduce the duration of domain
adaptation training. Deng et al. [48] argued that the ZSSR network’s consideration of only the Bicubic
downsampling degradation model was insufficient to represent the more complex degradation models
encountered by LR images in real-world scenarios. Therefore, they proposed the SRTTA network,
which considered various degradation factors such as GaussianBlur, DefocusBlur, GlassBlur, and
GaussianNoise. They used a pre-trained degradation classification network to identify the degradation
category of target domain LR images and generated corresponding pseudo-LR images based on
this classification. This more accurate degradation modeling enabled SRTTA to achieve better SR
performance. Rad et al. [49] constrained fine-tuning samples by actively selecting additional reference
samples that optimize fine-tuning efficiency, thereby improving network performance. Additionally,
Zhang et al. [50] and Cheng et al. [51] applied the concept of test-time domain adaptation to propose
Light Field Super-Resolution and Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution, respectively.

Although test-time domain-adaptive SR networks had considered various degradation models, real-
world scenarios involved highly complex degradation due to factors such as lighting and imaging
devices, which manual degradation models could not fully represent. To address this, adversarial gen-
erated domain adaptation methods emerged [14],[52],[53],[54],[15],[55],[56],[57], using generative
adversarial networks for implicit modeling of degradation, thereby avoiding the need for complex
manual modeling. Fritsche et al. [53] separated high-frequency and low-frequency information
for domain adaptation training. They considered that texture details correspond to high-frequency
information, which is crucial for SR tasks. Therefore, they applied high-frequency filtering before
feeding the features into the discriminator, using the discriminator to constrain the high-frequency
information, effectively improving SR performance in reconstructing texture details. Ji et al. [54]
similarly constrained generated images at the frequency level, using the discriminator for adversarial
training on high-frequency information and introducing a Frequency Density Comparator to enable
the network to perceive frequency differences at varying sampling rates, further improving SR
performance. Subsequently, Wang et al. [15] considered the impact of domain distance between
the target domain and the source domain on network domain adaptation training. They optimized
the network adaptation process based on the domain distance mapped by a discriminator, assigning
higher learning weights to samples with higher domain similarity, further enhancing the network’s fit
to the target domain. Yin et al. [55] also adopted the concept of distance awareness from [52] and
achieved good performance in facial SR tasks. Xu et al. [56] introduced two adversarial adaptation
modules to align source domain features with target domain features, achieving effective cross-device
domain adaptive super-resolution performance.

While adversarial generated domain adaptation networks achieved good performance, they required a
large number of target domain samples for network adaptation, making deployment challenging in
real-world scenarios. Testing-time domain adaptation methods could perform inference on individual
test samples from the target domain, but they required complex manual modeling of the target
domain’s degradation model and separate degradation modeling and training for each test LR image,
which was time-consuming.

The Alpha-CLIP model [23], trained on millions of data samples, covers a wide range of scenarios,
including various lighting conditions and degradation models, and possesses rich prior knowledge

and strong generalization. Therefore, we proposed the IODA method, which leverages Alpha-CLIP’s
extensive prior knowledge to guide domain adaptation for SR networks. IODA performs domain
adaptation using only a single LR image from the target domain without requiring HR image labels.
Additionally, when performing SR inference on a batch of data, domain adaptation training on a
single LR image suffices to achieve efficient super-resolution for all LR images in the target domain.

Figure 6: Text-guided domain adaptation. Existing generative networks typically sample from random
noise to generate latent vectors, which are then input into the generator network to produce images.
Red indicates adjustable weights, while blue indicates frozen weight.

B
Text-guided domain adaptation

As shown in Figure 6, the existing text-guided domain adaptation is primarily used in the field of
image generation. In the first stage, after pretraining the source domain generation network GSource
using the source domain dataset, it is duplicated to serve as the target domain generation network
GT arget. In the second stage, sample from random noise to generate latent vectors. Then, the
source domain generation network GSource and the target domain generation network GT arget are
used to respectively predict the source domain generated image ImageSource and the target domain
generated image ImageT arget from latent vectors. Corresponding source domain text description
TextSource ("Cat") and target domain text description TextT arget ("Dog") are provided. Convert
the source domain generated image, target domain generated image, source domain text description,
and target domain text description into CLIP space using CLIP image encoder and text encoder,
respectively. Existing methods aim to determine the text cross-domain direction vector ∆Text from
source domain text features to target domain text features in CLIP space, as well as to determine
the image cross-domain direction vector ∆Image from source domain generated image features to
target domain generated image features in CLIP space. By aligning these two cross-domain direction
vectors, training constraints are imposed on the target domain generation network. For instance, if
the text changes from "cat" to "dog," the generated image should also transition from a cat image to a
dog image.

C
Alpha-CLIP

As shown in Figure 7, Alpha-CLIP [23] introduces an additional region-range masking branch
(Alpha Conv) compared to CLIP [22]. During network training, this method concatenates the
region-range mask with RGB images into the CLIP image encoder EI and feeds the corresponding
text descriptions of the masked regions into the CLIP text encoder ET . Contrastive loss is used to
constrain the outputs of both encoders, where paired text-image samples are positive and unpaired
samples are negative. The introduction of region-range masks allows the network to focus more on
target features corresponding to the masked regions during inference.

The network pre-trained on the source domain dataset was tested on the target domain dataset, and
its test results were used as the baseline. From Figure 8, it can be observed that domain gap causes
significant noises in the baseline model under rainy, night, and snowy scenes. After the SR network
undergoes IODA domain adaptation, the noise is eliminated, resulting in a much improved visual
appearance. In addition, as shown in Figure 9, IODA demonstrates superior performance compared
to other domain adaptation methods for SR.

introduction sections.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe the limitations of the proposed method in the conclusion section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

---Page Break---
Justification: [TODO]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided a detailed description of the proposed method in the paper,
and we will release the source code to enhance the reproducibility of the method.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release the source code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release source code and provide a detailed description in the experi-
mental details section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We repeat the relevant experiments five times, using the mean and variance to
represent the results and reduce result uncertainty.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

21


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe the computational requirements in the Experimental Details
section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

23


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release the source code and provide a detailed explanation.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [TODO]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
