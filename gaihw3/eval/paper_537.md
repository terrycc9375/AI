Abstract

We introduce SuperClass, a super simple classification method for vision-language
pre-training on image-text data. Unlike its contrastive counterpart CLIP [57] who
contrast with a text encoder, SuperClass directly utilizes tokenized raw text as
supervised classification labels, without the need for additional text filtering or
selection. Due to the absence of the text encoding as contrastive target, SuperClass
does not require a text encoder and does not need to maintain a large batch size
as CLIP [57] does. SuperClass demonstrated superior performance on various
downstream tasks, including classic computer vision benchmarks and vision lan-
guage downstream tasks. We further explored the scaling behavior of SuperClass
on model size, training length, or data size, and reported encouraging results and
comparisons to CLIP .

Introduction

Pretraining methodologies [35, 57, 51, 60] that directly harness web-scale image-text dataset have
transformed the field of computer vision in recent years. Among them, contrastive language image
pretraining (CLIP) [57] has gained escalading popularity and become predominant due to the follow-
ing reasons. First, it serves as the industry-standard pre-trained model that facilitates zero-shot visual
recognition [50, 52] and finetuning on downstream tasks [19, 17]. Second, proper scaling behav-
iors [12] are observed such that CLIP can consistently benefit from larger models and bigger data to
some extent. Third, it offers strong cross-modal abilities as it is inherently designed to understand and
connect information across text and images. Therefore, CLIP-style models are the default choices
for most modern Visual Language Models [47, 2, 1], which connect a vision backbone with a deep
language model [69, 13].

Despite its success, CLIP necessitates very large batch sizes for training—typically over 64,000—to
achieve optimal performance, along with substantial computational resources for text encoding. This
high computational demand limits accessibility for researchers with limited resources and engineering
expertise. In our work, we aim to address the heavy computational burden by replacing contrastive
methodology with a simpler classification approach, eliminates the need for large contrastive batch
sizes, and text encoders.

In this work, we revisit the classification method for pretraining on large-scale text-image pairs. Some
previous works [54, 31, 39, 27, 51] attempt to tackle this by employing bag-of-words classification
in a weak supervised learning manner. However, most of these studies have been conducted on
a small scale, and there is no evidence demonstrating their scalability in terms of data and model
size. In contrast, our method demonstrates the performance of SuperClass on a scale comparable
to CLIP [57], achieving favorable model performance with 13 billion seen samples on 1 billion
unique text-image pairs. Some other concurrent efforts [31] have also attempted to replace contrastive
learning with classification. However, they rely heavily on preprocessing the text modality, using

bag-of-words and other hand-crafted rules to convert text into semi-labels. Some common practices
include filtering, word segmentation, lemmatization, and the removal of numbers and stopwords to
create a unique vocabulary of clean words. We found the preprocessing often eliminates long-tailed
words or stopwords that contain valuable information for representation learning (see Sec. 4.4). In
contrast, SuperClass simply utilizes raw word tokens as supervision signals without requiring any
hand-crafted preprocessing: no filtering or removal of stopwords. Hence SuperClass preserves all
information from the original text descriptions as supervision signal.

We proposed a Super-simple-Classification approach (SuperClass) that simply trains to classify raw
text tokens and scales as good as CLIP. As shown in Figure 1, similar to CLIP, SuperClass directly
operate on text tokens with any manual text filtering. Our comprehensive empirical study shows that
even without the need for a text encoder, classification methods can achieve performance comparable
to the contrastive approach in terms of both model capabilities and data scalability. We demonstrate
that SuperClass is a competitive alternative to its contrastive counterpart on both image classification
and vision & language tasks. Pretrained on the same Datacomp-1B [21] datasets with an equal number
of seen samples, SuperClass dominantly outperforms its contrastive counterparts across various of
vision only and vision & language scenarios. We further explore the scaling behavior of SuperClass
concerning model size and number of seen samples. Experiments suggest that classification-based
methods can exhibit competitive or even superior scaling behavior compared to their contrastive
counterparts. We hope our method, experiments and analysis can encourage future potentials of
classification-based methods as the foundational vision-language pretraining methods.

Related Work

With the growing availability of large-scale, web-sourced image-text datasets [57, 65, 6, 68, 21, 63,
4, 62], new methods have emerged to leverage this data as supervision for training deep representa-
tions. These approaches typically involve one of three strategies: using text as classification labels,
implementing image-text contrastive learning, or treating text as autoregressive targets.

Text as classification labels.
The exploration of image-text data for model training has deep roots,
with early work like Image-to-Word[54] over two decades ago aiming to enhance content-based
image retrieval. This study pioneered efforts to train models to predict nouns and adjectives in text
documents linked to images. Building on these early ideas, subsequent research has sought to improve
data efficiency[68, 43], model effectiveness [31, 27], and vocabulary expansion [27, 78, 51, 39]. With
the recent develop of network architecture, Tag2Text [27] and RAM [78] have employed Vision
Transformers (ViT) [18] as vision backbones, extracting nouns from the CC12M dataset [6] and,
through a combination of rules and manual selecting, arrived at 6,449 words to use as classification
categories. Similarly, CatLIP [51] has filtered out "gold labels" from the CC3M [65] and Datacomp-
1B [21] datasets based on certain rules, and then trained visual models using even larger-scale
image-text pair datasets.

---Page Break---
Unlike previous classification methods that rely on complex rules or manual filtering to curate "gold
labels" for classification vocabularies, our approach eliminates the need for such filtering. Instead,
we directly leverage text tokens as classification categories, preserving valuable textual information
that might otherwise be discarded.

Image-text contrastive learning.
Large-scale contrastive vision-language pretraining gained trac-
tion with the introduction of CLIP [57] and ALIGN [30]. Since then, numerous approaches have
focused on enhancing CLIP’s performance [76, 45, 44, 11, 7, 74]. For instance, SigLIP [76] reduces
the computational load of CLIP’s softmax-based contrastive loss by employing a sigmoid loss for
local pairwise similarity calculations. LiT [77] adopts pretrained vision and language backbones with
contrastive training, while other methods [45, 44, 19] aim to enhance training efficiency in image-text
pretraining. InternVL [11] further innovates by integrating a large language model as the text encoder
within CLIP.

In our approach, we challenge the necessity of an additional backbone to encode text information for
contrastive learning. Instead, we directly use text token input as the supervisory signal, eliminating
the need for text encoding and avoiding the computational overhead of large contrastive operations.
This streamlined setup achieves performance comparable to dual-backbone methods.

Text as autoregressive targets.
Various recent studies [15, 61, 38, 32, 41, 26] have delved into
employing image captioning for model pretraining. SimVLM [71] has innovated this field by
pioneering the pretraining of a multimodal encoder-decoder that fuses vision and language at an early
stage, leveraging a hybrid architecture for applications such as visual question answering (VQA).
CapPa [70] demonstrates that a simple encoder-decoder setup can efficiently pretrain vision encoders
solely through captioning. Furthermore, recently studies [75, 42, 37] combine contrastive learning
with captioning objectives, occasionally incorporating an additional text encoder.

In this work, we revisit the classification-based approach using large-scale visual-language datasets.
Unlike the image captioning methods mentioned earlier, our classification method integrates the
text captioning decoder within the vision encoder, allowing a single vision encoder to connect both
modalities. Experiments demonstrate that SuperClass achieves competitive, and often superior,
performance across various downstream tasks.

A simple classification approach to pretrain vision encoders

In this section, we present our proposed approach, SuperClass, which employs a classification-
based pretraining method using text supervision. We begin by outlining the general framework of
SuperClass. Next, we explain how text is converted into category labels without the need to select
"gold labels", allowing all text to supervise the training of the image encoder. Finally, we illustrate
our choice of loss design among various classification losses. Additionally, recognizing the differing
significance and discriminative power of each word, we incorporated inverse document frequency as
class weights in the loss design.

Overview.
We aim to establish a pretraining method based on image classification that matches
CLIP in simplicity, scalability, and efficiency. To achieve this, we follow the standard protocol
by utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones as vision encoders, followed by a global average
pooling layer and a linear layer as the classification head to output the logit vector x. The supervision
targets are derived from the text associated with the image, and the classification loss is computed
using the text-derived classification labels and the predicted logits.

Texts as Labels.
We directly use tokenized text as K-hot labels, where K is the number of tokens
in the given sentences. More specifically, for a given image-text dataset D = {(Ii, Ti) | i ∈[1, N]}
with N pairs of images I and text captions T, we differ from previous classification-based methods
by directly using an existing subword-level tokenizer, such as the one used in CLIP or BERT, with a
vocabulary size V . This tokenizer inputs the text T and obtain the set C of corresponding subword
IDs, which serves as the classification labels. The label in the set C satisfies {c ∈[1, V ]}. The
classification labels C will be converted into K-hot vector y ∈RV , where yc = 1 when c in the set C,
otherwise yc = 0.

Compared to previous methods, our approach does not require any preprocessing or manual threshold
setting, making it straightforward. At the same time, it also avoids the out-of-vocabulary issue that
might be encountered by previous approaches.

Classification Loss.
A significant body of research has focused on multi-label classification loss.
However, it is important to emphasize that our primary goal is to pretrain vision encoders rather than
prioritize multi-label classification accuracy. In a multi-label scenario, a Softmax loss is applied in
SuperClass by representing labels in a probabilistic manner, where ˆyc is a normalized weighted label.

ℓce = −

X

c=1
ˆyc log

(1)

We evaluated several multi-label classification losses, including Softmax loss, BCE loss, soft margin
loss, ASL [59], and two-way loss [33]. Surprisingly, the simple Softmax loss yielded the best
pretraining results. This may be due to the fact that existing multi-label classification losses assume
that labels are precise and exhaustive, aiming to optimize the margin between positive and negative
classes. However, the inherent noise in image-text data and the limitations of text in fully capturing
an image’s content mean that not all objects in an image are always referenced in the accompanying
text.

Inverse Document Frequency.
Within the subword vocabulary, not all categories contribute
semantically equally, as different words carry varying amounts of information. Additionally, the
subword dictionary contains many words unrelated to visual content that frequently appear in
sentences, which do not provide effective supervisory information. Therefore, words with higher
information content should be given greater weight during training. To achieve this, we employ
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) as a measure of information significance. The fewer the number
of samples containing a specific word, the stronger its ability to differentiate between samples. We
use the IDF statistic of each category (subword) as the weight for the corresponding classification
label, assigning different weights wc to the classification labels c.

where |D| denotes the total number of image-text pairs, df(c) is the document frequency (df) of
subword c, in other words, it’s the count of texts containing subword c. For greater ease of use, we
have implemented an online IDF statistic that is computed during the training process, eliminating the
need for pre-training offline statistics. This approach enhances the user-friendliness and portability of
our method.

Experiment

4.1
Experiment setup

We use a standard subset of the datacomp dataset [21] for pre-training, which contains about 1.3B
image-text pairs. A batch size of 16k and 90k are adopted for our classification models and CLIP
models. In the ablation section, all experiments are conducted with a batch size of 16k. To make a
fair comparsion with the CLIP, we use 90k batch size, adopt the AdamW with a cosine schedule, and
set the same learning rate and decay as CLIP.

4.2
Evaluation protocols

In order to better highlight the effectiveness of pretraining method, we concentrate on the properties
of the frozen representations.

Linear probing
We evaluate the classification accuracy when using the full ImageNet-1k [14]
training set to learn a dense projection layer and frozen the parameters of backbone. We follow the
linear probing training recipe from MAE [24].

Following the setting of Cappa [70], we perform 10-shot classification on

the mean results and variance.

Locked-image Tuning
Locked-image Tuning (LiT) [77] employs contrastive training to align
locked image and unlocked text models. Generally, LiT is an efficient way to equip any pretrained
vision backbone with zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities. We follow the setup from
LiT[77] and assess the zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet-1k [14].

Collaborating with language models
Motivated by recent works [47, 11, 1, 67, 2, 71] combining
pretrained vision backbones [57, 19, 76] and language models [69, 13], we investigate the amenability
of the learned representations to interface with a text decoder. Here, we evaluate two ways to
collaborate with large language models. 1) following ClipCap [53], we frozen both pretrained image
encoder and pretrained 12-layer GPT2 decoder [58], only train an adapter to connect the image
encoder and language model to perform image captioning on COCO captions [9]. 2) following
LLaVA [47] setup, we train and finetune a projection layer and a pretrained large language models,
Vicuna-7B [13] to solve downstream tasks, including VQAv2(val) [22], GQA [28], VizWiz(val) [23],
T-VQA(val) [66], SQA(img) [79], MMBench(en) [48], MME [20], POPE [46], MMMU [25] and
SEEDBench [40].

Comparison with different types of pretraining methods
In Table 1, we compare the models
trained by SuperClass with the different types of pretraining methods, including contrastive or
clustering based methods [10, 5, 80, 55], reconstruction based [3, 73, 8, 24], and vision-language

pretraining based methods [57, 70, 21]. In general, the proposed method achieves best performance
among these pretraining methods.

Compared to the current SOTA self-supervised model DINOv2 [55], our method achieves a 0.5%
higher accuracy in IN-1K linear probing (85.0 vs 84.5) without a bunch of bells and whistles.
Although SuperClass has seen more samples, it operates as a simpler classification framework and
does not employ MultiCrop, Masked Image Modeling, or Contrastive learning, as DINOv2 does.
Although comparing a self-supervised learning method to a (weakly) supervised learning approach
is a system-level comparison, we still observe that a simple classification pretraining approach
demonstrates superior performance across many classy benchmarks that shown in Table 2.

Compared to the contrastive counterparts CLIP [57], our method achieves higher linear probing top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset with ViT-Base (80.2 vs 78.5) and ViT-Large (85.0 vs 82.7) as
backbone. For a fair comparison, we further make a comparison with OpenCLIP [29] which trains
a ViT-Large model with a batch size 90k based on Datacomp-1B dataset. Our method consistently
outperforms OpenCLIP by a large margin (85.0 vs 83.9). In Table 2, our method surpasses OpenCLIP
on IN-1K and Pets by clear margins with improvements of 1.6 and 2.2 points, while being comparable
with OpenCLIP on Cars (92.6 v.s 92.7).

Further comparison with CLIP
In Table 3, we compare the models trained by SuperClass with
the currently widely used CLIP models, including zero-shot classification, and COCO captioning.
To verify the effectiveness of the pretraining method, we adapt the standard ViT [18] structure as
the visual backbone and added a classification head on top of it. We use the open-source Datacomp-
1B [21] dataset and encounter 13B samples in the training process.

For a better comparison with the CLIP models, we select three types: OpenAI’s CLIP ViT-L/14
trained on the internal WiT-400M data, and Laion’s CLIP ViT-L/14 trained on the open-source
Datacom-1B dataset. The checkpoints of these two models have been open-sourced. The checkpint
of Laion’s openCLIP is downloaded from Hugginface Hub1. For a fair comparison, we trained the
ViT-L/16 model with a batch size 90k based on the our codebase and Datacomp-1B dataset.

With Lock image Tuning [77], the trained classification model also gains the ability of zero-shot
classification. Our method achieves 79.7% Top-1 zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet-1k datatset which
is much better than OpenAI CLIP ViT-L/14 and OpenCLIP ViT-L/14. Although maybe they are not
directly comparable, this do reflect that the vision model trained by the proposed SuperClass is with
strong visual perception capabilities.

Combining the frozen vision encoder with a frozen pretrained 12-layer GPT-2 decoder [58] via a
trained adapter, the models are trained on COCO captions [9] and CIDEr socres are reported. We
observe that the CIDEr socres of our method are slightly below OpenAI’s CLIP, which may be due to
the use of different datasets; OpenAI’s CLIP utilizes an internal dataset, WiT-400M. However, our
approach outperforms our implemented CLIP model with the same settings.

Overall, the models trained by proposed SuperClass demonstrated marginally improved accuracy
in both classification capabilities and the vision & language task when compared to the contrastive
pretrained CLIP models.

Large multi-modal models
Many large multi-modal models integrate pre-trained vision backbones
with large language models. We explore how amenable the learned representations are to interfacing
with a text decoder. Following the LLaVA setup [47], we combine frozen CLIP models and SuperClass
models with the pretrained Vicuna-7B [13] and perform downstream tasks. In Figure 2, we show some
results of vision&language downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SuperClass models could
achieve better performance than CLIP models on the majority of datasets. It is worth mentioning
that, in comparison to CLIP models, SuperClass models exhibit significantly better performance on
VQAv2 [22], T-VQA [66], and MMBench [48], which pertain to OCR and fine-grained recognition
tasks, respectively. In addition, the overall accuracy measurement on VizWiz [23] are not stable due
to a significant portion of questions being labeled as unanswerable. To ensure the completeness of
our findings, we still present the results on this dataset.

Due to space limitations, detailed numerical results are provided in the appendix. Additionally, you
can find more experimental results in the appendix.

Top row: We compare the performance of vision backbones—ViT-S/16, B/16, and L/16—pretrained
via classification and contrastive methods with the same batch size of 16k and 512 million seen
samples, focusing on their size and computational cost. SuperClass demonstrates better scaling on
zero-shot classification and VQAv2, T-VQA tasks. Bottom row: Comparing SuperClass and CLIP,
performance increases with more training examples, mirroring the effects of model scaling. All
methods are trained the same batch size of 16k and ViT-L/16 as backbone.

Model scaling results
In the top row of Figure 2, we showcase the performance across classification
and vision & language tasks for varying model scales. For a fair comparison, both CLIP and
SuperClass models undergo training with identical settings, which include a batch size of 16k and 512
million seen samples. As shown in Figure 2, with the model scaling up, we observe a corresponding
enhancement in performance, whether it is for classification tasks or the downstream tasks associated
with LLaVA. Generally speaking, with the same model size, models pre-trained using SuperClass
exhibit superior precision compared to those trained with CLIP. SuperClass demonstrates better
scaling on zero-shot classification and VQAv2, T-VQA tasks.

Data Scaling results
In the bottom row of Figure 2, we showcase the performance across classi-
fication and vision & language tasks for varying seen samples. For a fair comparison, both CLIP
and SuperClass models undergo training with identical settings, which include a batch size of 16k
and ViT-L/16 as backbone. Figure 2 illustrates that as the number of seen samples grows, there is
a noticeable improvement in performance for both classification and downstream tasks linked to
LLaVA. Typically, models pre-trained with SuperClass outperform those trained with CLIP in terms
of accuracy when given the same amount of seen samples. SuperClass exhibits the same or slightly
better scaling behavior compared to CLIP on downstream tasks. In addition, SuperClass does not
require a text encoder, it offers better efficiency in training compared to CLIP.

Ablations

To verify the rationality of the SuperClass, we conduct extensive ablation experiments that pretrain on
datacomp-1B [21] and evaluate on several downstream tasks with different settings for SuperClass.

Word-level tokenizer vs. Subword-level tokenizer
Table 4 presents the results of word-level
tokenizer and subword-level tokenizer on serval daownstream tasks. We use the tokeinzer in openai
CLIP as our subword-level tokenizer. We compare it with the word-level tokenizer used in CatLIP [51],
which carefully selected approximately 40,000 "gold labels" from the datacomp-1B dataset. Aside
from the tokenizer being different, all models are trained under the same settings.

For ViT-S/16, word-level tokenizer achieves better classification accuracy than subword-level tok-
enizer. A possible reason is that when the model capacity is limited, the filtered clean supervisory

information may be more conducive to model convergence. However, with the increasing size of
the model, subword-level tokenizer gradually outperforms the word-level tokenizer, whether in
classification tasks or vision & language tasks.

Regardless of model size, on most vision & language tasks, subword-level tokenizer tends to perform
better than word-level tokenizer. The reason may be that subword-level tokenizer retain a substantial
amount of language-related information, although it may not be highly relevant to visual information.
This makes the features of the models trained with the subword-level tokenizer more readily integrated
with large language models.

Overall, using a subword-level tokenizer exhibits better scaling behavior and is more suitable for use
in large multi-modal models.

Different subword-level tokenizers
Table 5 presents the results on classification tasks and LLaVA
downstream tasks with different subword-level tokenizers. Here, we compare the character-based
byte pair encoding tokenizer [64] used in CLIP [57], the WordPiece [72] tokenizer used in BERT [16]
and the SentencePiece [36] tokenizer used in LLama [69], they are all subword-level tokenizers.
The tokenizer used in openai CLIP obtains best performance on the classification task and LLaVA
downstream tasks. Finally, we choose the tokenizer used in CLIP [57] for the training of SuperClass
models.

Classification loss
Table 6 represents different classification loss on ImageNet-1k dataset. We
selected several of the most commonly used multi-label classification losses for experimentation.
Softmax loss is often used in single-label classification tasks. It is possible apply a softmax loss
in a multi-label scenario through describing labels in a probabilistic way. BCE loss is a binary
cross-entropy (BCE) loss and is often used in multi-label classification tasks as baseline. Asymmetric
Loss(ASL loss) a improved BCE loss to address positive-negative imbalance. Soft margin loss is a

margin-based loss for multi-label classification tasks. Two-way loss is the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) for multi-label classification tasks.

Surprisingly, the simplest softmax loss outperforms all other multi-label classification losses by a
large margin. We believe that existing multi-label classification losses operate under the assumption
that labels are both accurate and complete, aiming to optimize the classification margin between
positive and negative classes. However, in reality, image-text data contains considerable noise, and
a single text passage cannot possibly capture all the contents of an image. Consequently, certain
categorical objects present in the image may not be mentioned in the associated text. In the context of
image-text pretraining, how to design a better loss function remains a question worthy of exploration.

IDF as class weights
Considering that the importance of each category (subword) in the vocabulary
is not equal and the information they carry varies, we use IDF as class weights. The Table 7 repsents
the results of with and without IDF as class weights. SuperClass without IDF experienced a noticeable
decrease in accuracy on classification tasks, the change in precision on LLaVA tasks is not significant.

Removing stopwords?
Stop words are commonly used in Text Mining and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to eliminate words that are so widely used that they carry very little useful
information. In the previous classification methods, the stopwords are removed. The stopwords are
download from NLTK [49]. However, the results in Table 7 shows that the keeping stopwords could
help the vision encoder to gain better performance on classification tasks.

Limitation and Conclusion

We have conducted a thorough comparison of vision encoders pre-trained with contrastive and
classification objectives and determined that models pre-trained with classification surpass CLIP
models in both classification and vision & language tasks. Additionally, our approach does not
require a text encoder, which leads to higher training efficiency than that of CLIP. Furthermore, our
findings suggest that classification as a pre-training task may have beneficial scaling properties as
model and data sizes increase, and we encourage future research to delve into this possibility.

While it delivers impressive results on various downstream tasks, it completely ignore word order and
object relationships, which implies that we are losing important supervisory information. Addressing
this will be the direction of our future research efforts.

To sum up, we have demonstrated that straightforward image classification can serve as an effective
pre-training strategy for vision backbones derived from image-text data. Our aim is to stimulate
subsequent studies to pay more attention to the benefits of classification as a pre-training task for
vision encoders.

Broader Impacts

This work presents a new approach to train vision models, which can be applied for image recognition
and other vision tasks. The approach demonstrates higher efficiency than the popular one in the
community, which can reduce the computational cost and the power cost for computer vision model
training.

Data Scaling results
In Table 8, we showcase the performance across classification and vision &
language tasks for varying seen samples. For a fair comparison, both CLIP and SuperClass models
undergo training with identical settings, which include a batch size of 16k and ViT-L/16 as backbone.

Figure 2 illustrates that as the number of seen samples grows, there is a noticeable improvement
in performance for both classification and downstream tasks linked to LLaVA. Typically, models
pre-trained with SuperClass outperform those trained with CLIP in terms of accuracy when given
the same amount of seen samples. SuperClass exhibits the same or slightly better scaling behavior
compared to CLIP on downstream tasks. In addition, SuperClass does not require a text encoder, it
offers better efficiency in training compared to CLIP.

Model scaling results
In Table 9, we showcase the performance across classification and vision &
language tasks for varying model scales. For a fair comparison, both CLIP and SuperClass models
undergo training with identical settings, which include a batch size of 16k and 512 million seen
samples.

As shown in Figure 2, with the model scaling up, we observe a corresponding enhancement in
performance, whether it is for classification tasks or the downstream tasks associated with LLaVA.
Generally speaking, with the same model size, models pre-trained using SuperClass exhibit superior
precision compared to those trained with CLIP. SuperClass demonstrates better scaling on zero-shot
classification and VQAv2, T-VQA tasks.

Superclass with different model types
To evaluate the robustness of our proposed method across
different model types, we selected two representative convolution-based networks: ResNet50 and
ConvNext-Tiny. We compare SuperClass against CLIP for ImageNet zero-shot (LiT) and linear
probing classification, as shown in Table 10. All experiments were conducted with a batch size of
16k and 1.28B seen samples. We observe that SuperClass surpasses CLIP in all settings by a clear
margin, ranging from 1.64 to 2.91. These results demonstrate that the superiority of SuperClass over
CLIP is robust across different model architectures.

VLM downstream tasks with different types of pretraining models
Following the LLaVA setup,
we combine frozen CLIP models, self-supervised models, and SuperClass models with the pre-trained
Vicuna-7B and perform downstream tasks. The experimental results in Table 11 demonstrate that the
proposed method could achieve better than self-supervised ViT pre-training methods, like DINOv2,
and weakly-supervised methods, like CLIP.

Comparison with other classification based pretraining models
We have included the compari-
son with other classification-based methods, like CatLIP [51] in the subsection Word-level tokenizer
vs. Subword-level tokenizer. The word-level tokenizer is used in CatLIP [51], which carefully
selected approximately 40,000 "gold labels" from the datacomp-1B dataset. Aside from the tokenizer
being different, all models are trained under the same settings. The results of Table 4 show that with
the increasing size of the model, the subword-level tokenizer gradually outperforms the word-level
tokenizer, whether in classification tasks or vision & language tasks. We also provide the results
of finetuning on ImageNet-1k in Table 12. Using the same dataset Datacom-1B for training, the
same backbone ViT-L/16 as backbone, the same number 13 Billion of training samples seen, the
SuperClass could achieve better performance than CatLIP (87.8 vs 86.5).

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: refer to abstract and introduction
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Discussed in the conclusion
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

17


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Important details are provided in the experiment section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: We use public data for model training. The code will be cleaned and made
public in the future.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we provide all the details in the experiment section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We follow the convention in prior works and report the performance number
on the standard benchmarks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

19


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: please refer to the experiment section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss in the conclusion.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We used public datasets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
