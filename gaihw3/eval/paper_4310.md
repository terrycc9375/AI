Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are considered a crucial technology for advanc-
ing intelligent education since they exhibit the potential for an in-depth under-
standing of teaching scenarios and providing students with personalized guidance.
Nonetheless, current LLM-based application in personalized teaching predomi-
nantly follows a “Question-Answering” paradigm, where students are passively
provided with answers and explanations. In this paper, we propose SocraticLM,
which achieves a Socratic “Thought-Provoking” teaching paradigm that fulfills
the role of a real classroom teacher in actively engaging students in the thought
process required for genuine problem-solving mastery. To build SocraticLM, we
first propose a novel “Dean-Teacher-Student” multi-agent pipeline to construct a
new dataset, SocraTeach, which contains 35K meticulously crafted Socratic-style
multi-round (equivalent to 208K single-round) teaching dialogues grounded in
fundamental mathematical problems. Our dataset simulates authentic teaching sce-
narios, interacting with six representative types of simulated students with different
cognitive states, and strengthening four crucial teaching abilities. SocraticLM is
then fine-tuned on SocraTeach with three strategies balancing its teaching and
reasoning abilities. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive evaluation system
encompassing five pedagogical dimensions for assessing the teaching quality of
LLMs. Extensive experiments verify that SocraticLM achieves significant improve-
ments in the teaching performance, outperforming GPT4 by more than 12%. Our
dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Ljyustc/SocraticLM.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a variety of tasks including
natural language processing, translation, and question-answering [54, 56, 59]. This draws widespread
attention to the potential of using LLMs to revolutionize intelligent education, especially personalized
teaching [2, 23, 39], mainly due to their two advantages. On one hand, LLMs have displayed human-
like mastery and proficiency of knowledge in fundamental subjects like math and physics [1, 48].
Therefore, they can effectively deliver subject-specific instructions to students like a real teacher. On
the other hand, LLMs exhibit exceptional understanding and adaptability to users’ (i.e., students’)
inputs. They are capable of comprehending diverse students’ demands, providing instant feedback,
and engaging in interactive pedagogy. Based on these two aspects, there has been a lot of research

(a) "Question-Answering" teaching paradigm

Problem: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many 
pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?

I don't know how to solve this problem.

Julie read 12 x 2 = 24 pages today. 
So she was able to read a total of 
12 + 24 = 36 pages since 
yesterday. There are 120 - 36 = 84 
pages left to be read. Since she 
wants to read half of the 
remaining pages tomorrow, then 
she should read 84/2 = 42 pages.

I don't know how to solve this problem.

That's okay. In this problem, we need to first calculate how many pages 
are remaining. To do this, we need to first count the number of pages 
Julie has read today. Do you know how to calculate it?

Was it 12 pages?

Nice try, but Julie read twice as many pages today as she did yesterday. If 
she read 12 pages yesterday, how many pages would she have read today?

(b) "Thought-Provoking" teaching paradigm

OK, I think it's 24.

Great! Now, we can calculate the total number of pages 
Julie has read since yesterday? Can you figure it out?

…

I know, half of 84 is 42, so Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.

investigating to apply a general LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to personalized teaching [5, 18, 44, 51], or
building specific teaching LLMs, such as MathGPT 2, EduGPT 3, and EduChat [10].

However, current LLMs-based personalized teaching methods predominantly adhere to a “Question-
Answering” paradigm. As shown in Figure 1(a), they passively offer functionalities such as providing
answers to questions and explaining knowledge concepts to students’ queries. In this process, they
oversimplify the teaching into a series of Q&As, directly delivering complete answers based on
CoT [56], ToT [57], etc., which falls short of truly identifying the issues students may have and
offering targeted assistance. Consequently, students may struggle to comprehend the problem-solving
process, lack a genuine improvement in their ability, and fail to resolve similar issues in the future.

In this paper, we draw inspiration from the Socratic method of teaching [13, 45] and propose Socrati-
cLM, which achieves a novel “Thought-Provoking” teaching paradigm as depicted in Figure 1(b).
The key of this paradigm is to engage students in a dialogue to active participation in the learning
process, which continually poses open-ended questions (marked red, e.g., “... how to calculate it?”)
to encourage them to articulate their thoughts, challenge assumptions, and think independently. This
process enables students to learn to solve a problem by themselves, thereby fostering a deeper mastery
and ability. Compared with LLM-based applications using prompt engineering directly (e.g., GPT4),
we aim to systematically study 1) The pedagogical demands of “Thought-Provoking” teaching and
empower SocraticLM to fulfill these demands. 2) The teaching abilities of teachers and reinforce
these abilities in SocraticLM. 3) The cognitive states of students and enable SocraticLM to accurately
identify them during the teaching process. Consequently, our SocraticLM can provide higher quality
guidance that is more tailored and appropriate for each student’s needs, transitioning from a “guardian
of knowledge” to “choreographer of learning”.

To build SocraticLM, we first construct a new dataset, SocraTeach, which consists of 35K high-quality,
fine-grained Socratic-style multi-round teaching dialogues grounded in mathematical problems. In
constructing the dataset, we propose a novel “Dean-Teacher-Student” pipeline, implementing three
LLM agents to simulate the key roles in authentic teaching scenarios: Dean, Teacher, and Student. The
Dean is a director that oversees and refines the Teacher’s instructions before they are presented to the
Student, ensuring that the whole teaching process adheres to the Socratic style. The Teacher actively
and gradually guides the Student to solve a problem by generating Socratic instructions, inspired by
classic pedagogical theories [13, 45]. The Student responds to the Teacher’s instructions, where we
establish a student cognitive state system that simulates six kinds of students in classroom to cover
real and diverse teaching scenarios. Through multiple rounds of “Teacher-Student” interaction under
the supervision of Dean, a comprehensive Socratic teaching dialogue is formed. One step further, to
enhance the diversity and robustness of our dataset, we summarize four types of student responses
from real teaching scenarios and perform data augmentation to generate extra 22K single-round
teaching dialogues, specifically tailored to enhance four corresponding crucial teaching abilities.

We fine-tune ChatGLM3-6b [12] on our SocraTeach dataset to obtain SocraticLM. During this
process, we elaborate three training strategies to improve the pedagogical abilities while ensuring
the problem-solving capacity of SocraticLM simultaneously. In addition, we contribute a novel
evaluation system encompassing five pedagogical dimensions for assessing the teaching quality of
LLMs, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first exploration in this field. Experimental results
show that our dataset can enhance the pedagogical performances of LLMs and the teaching quality of
our SocraticLM surpasses GPT4 by more than 12%.

The contributions of this paper are:

• We present SocraticLM, a language model that achieves Socratic “Thought-Provoking” teach-
ing paradigm. Experimental results show that its Socratic teaching quality exceeds GPT4 by
12%, while maintaining the good problem-solving ability of the original ChatGLM3-6b.

• We construct a new dataset SocraTeach that contains massive, fine-grained Socratic teaching
dialogues. To construct SocraTeach, we propose a novel “Dean-Teacher-Student” multi-
agent pipeline, in which we design an innovative supervisory role Dean, a cognitive state
system to direct the Student’s behavior, and an enhancement in four teaching abilities for
the Teacher. This pipeline is general and can be transferred to the teaching in other subjects.

• We develop a five-dimensional comprehensive evaluation system to assess the teaching
quality of LLMs, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt in the field.

LLMs-enhanced intelligent education. Large language models (LLMs) revolutionize three typical
applications of intelligent education, namely automatic generation of educational resources, instant
assessment of student learning outcomes, and personalized teaching assistance [26, 29, 42]. For
educational resources, there is a tendency to use LLMs to generate textbooks, exercises, etc., based on
teaching goals and needs, providing teachers with richer inspiration [4, 16]. For students’ outcomes,
LLMs can analyze students’ homework and exams to provide assessments and feedbacks on their
learning progress [9]. As for the most concerned personalized teaching in this paper, one line of
research uses general LLMs like ChatGPT to provide students with multi-level assistance [44, 51, 58]
in multiple disciplines, such as writing [18], programming [5], and medical education [25]. By
analyzing students’ learning data and behavioral patterns, these LLMs also have the potential to
design unique learning paths to help students learn more effectively [20]. Another line of research
is to collect a large amount of teaching instructions to fine-tune large models (e.g., EduChat [10]),
giving them targeted teaching capabilities such as problem solving and emotional support.

Personalized teaching dialogue dataset. Constructing teaching dialogues is the basis for building
LLM-based personalized teaching systems. In the literature, early attempts relied on crowd-sourcing
(e.g., CIMA [49]) or rules (e.g., AutoTutor [17]) to create authentic dialogues. Subsequently, re-
searchers adopted human-computer collaborative approaches. For instance, QuizBot [46] leveraged
semantic similarity algorithms to analyze real students’ responses and provided adaptive question
by predefined teaching workflow. However, these methods required substantial manual effort or
were constrained by predefined teaching procedures, resulting in limited scalability and difficulty in
covering diverse real-world teaching scenarios. Recently, with LLMs demonstrating advantages in
synthetic data generation [28], utilizing them to assist in teaching dialogue generation has attracted
much attention. However, existing research [51] suggests that GPTs make for a bad teacher, thus cur-
rent efforts mainly use LLMs to simulate students with different backgrounds [41], personalities [41]
and error types [40], followed by human teachers providing explanations. Nevertheless, this process
still requires human involvement, resulting in the latest dataset MATHDIAL [40] containing only 3K
samples. Besides, these datasets also lack a systematic investigation into Socratic teaching.

The SocraTeach Dataset

Pedagogical theories point out that there are two basic demands for Socratic teaching [13, 45]: 1)
it is fundamentally dialogic, relying on conversations between teachers and students to facilitate
learning; 2) it uses probing questions to actively engage students, promoting independent thinking
and encouraging them to find answers themselves. In building our SocraTeach dataset to meet these

requirements, we face the following challenges. First, for the teacher, there is considerable variability
in pedagogical methodologies and presentation styles among teachers. It may be difficult for a
model to learn all of them at once, which may result in confusion and errors within the teaching
logic. Second, for the student, in real teaching scenarios, students’ cognitive states are intricate
and heterogeneous [22, 35]. While some students have strong understanding abilities and sufficient
knowledge, there are also a considerable number of students who cannot understand the problem or
even lack the essential knowledge. We expect that our dataset should cover all these situations, so
that the model can learn to provide different levels of guidance for students with different states.

To solve the above challenges, we construct SocraTeach as follows. First, for each problem that needs
to be taught, we decompose a list of step-wise guiding questions (Section 3.1). On this basis, we can
control the simulation of teachers by aligning the instructional approach and explanatory style with
these questions. Second, we devise an innovative “Dean-Teacher-Student” pipeline, implementing
three LLM agents including “Dean”, “Teacher”, and “Student” to collect fine-grained multi-round
teaching dialogues (Section 3.2). Especially, to align with student profiles in authentic scenarios,
we build a cognitive state system to simulate six kinds of students in “Student” from the aspects of
comprehension, calculation, knowledge mastery, etc. (Section 3.3). Finally, to further enhance the
diversity and robustness of SocraTeach, we design data augmentation methods to construct additional
single-round teaching dialogues for improving four crucial teaching abilities (Section 3.4).

3.1
Problem Collection & Step-by-Step Guiding Questions

In this paper, we take the teaching of mathematical problems at the primary school level as an example
for exploration, because mathematics is a fundamental and critical subject and such problems involve
the examination of students’ basic understanding and reasoning abilities [32, 34]. Our problems are
sourced from two representative datasets: MAWPS [27] and GSM8K [8], which contain 2.3K and
8.8K problems, respectively.

To ensure that the expression style and teaching approach are consistent in simulating the teacher
role, we decompose each problem into a series of step-by-step guiding questions, such as Q1-Q4 in
Figure 2 (please refer to Appendix A for details). It should be noted that to ensure the efficiency and
conciseness of teaching, a numerical calculation and a summary of the solution do not count as a step.

3.2
The Dean-Teacher-Student Pipeline

To create our SocraTeach dataset that achieves the Socratic “Thought-Provoking” teaching paradigm,
we propose a novel “Dean-Teacher-Student” (DTS) pipeline to collect one-to-one, multi-round,
teacher-student dialogues, which consists of three LLM agents:

• Dean D: Research has indicated that GPTs have inadequacies in understanding students and
language expression required to serve as a teacher [51]. To address this issue, we propose a

4


---Page Break---
Dean agent to serve as an oversight role, which judges whether the Teacher’s instructions
meet the requirements of Socratic teaching. If it thinks the instructions do not meet the
requirements, it has the authority to revise them before they are presented to the Student.

• Teacher T : The Teacher agent actively provokes the Student agent to solve problems in a
Socratic style, serving two primary purposes according to Socrates’ educational theory [13,
45]. First, it should prompt the Student to think at the appropriate time with Socratic
questions, such as guiding the Student to consider the next step after completing a reasoning
step. Second, it needs to provide the Student with explanations of the steps and the involved
knowledge points. To maintain a consistent teaching style for a given problem, the Teacher
is asked to deliver teaching following the step-by-step questions constructed in Section 3.1.

• Student S: Representing the learner within the dataset, the Student agent generates replies
to the Teacher’s instructions (i.e., questions and explanations). To ensure the authenticity
and diversity of Student, we build a cognitive state system that describes six kinds of real
students in Section 3.3 and set Student to simulate one of them each time it replies.

In DTS pipeline, each teaching dialogue {(T1, S1), (T2, S2), ...} is formed by a cycle of interaction
between Teacher and Student under the supervision of Dean, and each agent is simulated with GPT4.
Taking Figure 2 as an example, in the first round (t = 1), the Teacher directly gives the question of
the first step (i.e., T1 = Q1) constructed in Section 3.1 (this process does not need the use of LLMs).
Then, the Student selects a state profile (e.g., weak knowledge mastery) from six types of cognitive
portraits in Section 3.3 and generates a corresponding response S1 based on it (see Appendix B.1
for prompt). After that, at t = 2, the Teacher provides instruction T2 in a Socratic style, in which
we design pedagogical demands such as not providing answers but rather following the flow of the
step-by-step questions. It should be emphasized that here we set up a different response style for each
student profile through examples (Appendix B.2). After the Teacher generates T2, the Dean judges
(e.g., “... doesn’t meet the teaching criteria”) and revises it (e.g., change “can you ... 12 times 2?” to
“how many ... read today?”), focusing on 1) Whether it conforms to the Socratic style. 2) Whether it
clearly points out the mistakes made by the Student. 3) Whether its language style resembles that of
a real teacher (Appendix B.3), i.e., T2 ←D(T2). The revised response is then sent to the Student,
and the next round of dialogue begins. Ultimately, if the Teacher thinks that the teaching process has
been completed, it will output an “[END]” token as the ending of its output, indicating to terminate
the cycle. It is worth noting that although we focus on teaching mathematical problems in this paper,
our DTS pipeline is general and can be extended to problems in other subjects (e.g., physics).

3.3
Student Cognitive State System

To ensure that our dataset covers the real and diverse student status throughout the teaching process,
it is necessary to simulate different student cognitive states within the Student agent. However, a
systematic and unified definition of these states has not been established in existing research [15].
Some previous studies have concentrated on states that are specific to particular subjects such as
math and English [3, 11, 19, 50], while others abstractly define general states based on human
cognitive science, such as concentration, working memory, and logical reasoning [14, 47, 53, 33].
Unfortunately, these definitions are either unadaptable to the teaching process or difficult to implement
with LLMs. To address this issue, we review the Socratic teaching process from the perspective of
students as follows. Initially, a student needs to grasp the meaning of the problem at hand. Then,
he/she comprehends the instructions provided by the teachers and utilizes the computational ability
and acquired knowledge to execute the instructions. Ultimately, this process fosters an interest
in learning and helps to cultivate effective study results. Based on this idea, we summarize five
dimensions of cognitive state:

(1) Problem Understanding: refers to the degree to which students understand the given problem.

(2) Instruction Understanding: refers to the degree to which students understand and carry out the
teacher’s instructions. A student in a good state should easily accomplish these instructions.

(3) Calculation: refers to the ability to derive mathematical expressions and numbers correctly.

(4) Knowledge Mastery: refers to the extent to which students have mastered knowledge.

(5) Thirst for Learning: refers to the students’ desire or inclination to seek and acquire new
information, ask questions, and explore possibilities.

5


---Page Break---
Basically, we can define five types of students who perform poorly on one of the above dimensions.
Moreover, we add a sixth type of student who excels at all dimensions.

3.4
Teaching Ability Enhancement

The multi-round dialogues constructed by DTS pipeline (denoted as DiaM) ensure a model to grasp
the fundamental Socratic teaching paradigm. However, in DiaM, the Student responds only once to
each instruction given by the Teacher and tends to choose simpler student portraits, leading to a lack
of simulation for long-tail student responses (as discussed in Appendix D). In this section, to further
enhance the diversity and robustness of our dataset, we construct more Student-Teacher single-round
dialogues DiaS through data augmentation on DiaM, improving four important teaching abilities.

Specifically, in real teaching processes, students’ responses can be classified as follows. First, from the
macro perspective, the responses can be divided into “Irrelevant” and “Relevant”. “Relevant” refers
to responses directly related to the problem or instruction, while “Irrelevant” means that the responses
are unrelated to the instructional content, such as asking “How’s the weather today?” in Figure 2.
Second, within the “Relevant” category, it can be further divided into “Questioning” and “Replying”,
which refers to students asking questions to the teacher and answering the teacher’s questions,
respectively. Third, “Replying” can be further classified as “Incorrect-reply” and “Correct-reply”
based on whether the students’ responses to the teacher’s question are correct or not. Along this line,
students’ responses include four categories: “Irrelevant”, “Questioning”, “Incorrect-reply”, and
“Correct-reply”. On this basis, there are four key teaching abilities that need targeted enhancement.

First, for “Irrelevant” responses, we expect a teacher to recognize them and redirect the conversation
towards teaching, such as responding “This question is unrelated to ... Let’s focus on the problem
first ...”. To achieve this, we collect 200 genuine student inquiries from MOOCs that are unrelated to
teaching and then construct 2, 000 single-round Student-Teacher dialogues by randomly inserting
them into DiaM and asking Teacher to refuse answering (please refer to Appendix C for details).

Second, “Questioning” corresponds to the most crucial teaching ability, that is, a teacher should pro-
vide students with accurate explanations. Regarding it, we randomly sample 2, 000 Teacher-Student
conversation (Ti, Si) from DiaM and use Student agent to ask three more questions S1
i , S2
i , S3
i for
Ti (see Appendix C.1 for prompt). Then, we ask the Teacher agent to provide T 1
i+1, T 2
i+1, T 3
i+1,
ultimately forming 6, 000 single-round Student-Teacher {(Sj
i , T j
i+1)|j = 1, 2, 3} dialogues.

Third, a teacher should accurately identify students’ “Incorrect-reply” and point out the idea of
correction. To achieve this, we similarly sample 2, 000 Teacher-Student conversation from DiaM and
employ rules and generation techniques to rewrite the Student’s responses into five wrong answers.
Then, we explicitly prompt the Teacher to identify the errors and provide a response, obtaining
another 10K instances of Student-Teacher dialogues (please refer to Appendix C for details).

Finally, to enable teachers to identify different expressions of the same “Correct-reply” for enhancing
robustness, we take the same 2, 000 single-round “Teacher-Student” dialogues used for “Incorrect-
reply” and create two correct responses with Student (see Appendix C.2 for prompt). Subsequently,
we collect Teacher’s replies and obtain another 4, 000 single-round “Student-Teacher” dialogues.

3.5
Dataset Overview

In summary, our SocraTeach consists of 35K multi-round dialogues DiaM constructed by “Dean-
Teacher-Student” pipeline in Sections 3.2 and 22K single-round dialogues DiaS through data aug-
mentation in Section 3.4. The average number of rounds in DiaM is 5.28, resulting in a total of 208K
single-round dialogue examples. More statistics of SocraTeach are summarized in Appendix D.

In comparison to existing teaching dialogue datasets [17, 40, 41, 46, 49], our SocraTeach first
addresses the deficiency of LLMs inadequately simulating teachers [51] by introducing the role
of “Dean” for supervision and correction. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, SocraTeach is
the first publicly available dataset designed for Socratic teaching, which specifically enhances four
key teaching abilities of Teacher. Thirdly, while existing datasets simulate different students by
setting their demographic backgrounds (e.g., grade) or specific error types, SocraTeach models six
cognitive states of Student during the teaching process based on pedagogical experience, which
covers a wider range of authentic teaching scenarios and enables LLMs to possess better teaching
capabilities. Lastly, SocraTeach is a fully automatically generated large-scale dataset containing 35K

6


---Page Break---
multi-round dialogues and 22K single-round dialogues, significantly surpassing the existing datasets
that rely on real human students/teachers (e.g., the latest MATHDIAL [40] contains 3K dialogues).

4
Fine-tune SocraticLM

Based on SocraTeach, we can fine-tune a SOTA LLM (e.g., ChatGLM3-6b [12]) by splitting
each dialogue {(T1, S1), (T2, S2), ...} into multiple rounds, using the preceding context of each
round {(T1, S1), ..., (Ti, Si)} as input and the Teacher’s response Ti+1 as output. However, it may
lead to catastrophic forgetting and reduce the problem-solving ability that the model already has
because these dialogues may differ from the data used for pre-training [21, 30, 38]. Specifically,
we observe a decrease of 31.2%/9.7% in the accuracy of SocraticLM on the GSM8K/MAWPS
dataset in Section 6.2. Therefore, to enhance SocraticLM’s teaching ability without compromising its
fundamental problem-solving capability, we explore the following three training strategies:

Separate Training. To maintain problem-solving ability, one direct way is to mix the dialogue and
problem-solving data for training. However, we discover that it does not yield satisfactory results as
shown in Section 6.2. Therefore, we adopt a separate training approach wherein we first fine-tune
SocraticLM using dialogue data and then fine-tune it on a small amount of problem-solving data
randomly sampled from GSM8K and MAWPS. Our experiments revealed that optimal performance
is achieved when the ratio α of problem-solving data to the dialogue data is approximately
1
10.

Instruction Tuning. Inspired by [37], we employ different instructions for the dialogue data and
problem-solving data, with the templates presented in Appendix E. It is worth noting that, unlike the
prompt for Teacher in Section 3.2, here our instruction for dialogues does not require the model to
follow the step-by-step guiding questions in Section 3.1. This is because providing such information
in training may lead the model to take shortcuts, that is, to simplify the teaching process into
information extraction from the prompt, without truly mastering the pedagogical ability.

Mixed Prompt Setting. Training with mixed prompt settings for the same task is an important
method for improving LLMs’ reasoning abilities [7, 55]. To this end, in addition to the original
zero-shot problem-solving data of GSM8K and MAWPS, we also construct their one-shot version for
training, which consists of approximately
1
10 of the amount of zero-shot data.

5
Our Socratic Teaching Evaluation System

Since there is no standard answer for the teaching process, previous metrics that calculate the similarity
between model-generated responses and annotated responses (e.g., BLEU [43], Rouge [31]) may
not fully assess the teaching quality of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we contribute an
evaluation system encompassing five pedagogical dimensions for Socratic style and teaching abilities,
which to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive exploration in this field.

(1) Overall Quality (Overall): This metric is a holistic and subjective evaluation of teaching quality,
requiring that the instruction satisfies Socratic style and enhances students’ experience.

For Overall Quality, we randomly select 1, 000 single-round “Student-Teacher” conversations from
DiaM and recruit 10 well-educated annotators to blindly rank the Teacher response pairs provided
by each model and GPT4 in the same context (please refer to Appendix F for details). The Overall
Quality is estimated by a normalized win rate difference 1

2(1 +
W in−Lost
W in+Lost+T ie) ∈(0, 1) (GPT4’s
own result is 0.5). To ensure agreement of quality judge among humans, we also randomly construct
100 Teacher response pairs of SocraticLM and GPT4 and ask all annotators to judge which one is
better. The Kappa score is 0.70, indicating good agreement among human annotators.

For the four Socratic teaching abilities we elaborated in Section 3.4, we propose metrics (2)-(5). For
each of them, we randomly select 100 corresponding single-round dialogues from DiaS for testing.

(2) Incorrect Answer Recognition Accuracy (IARA): This dimension focuses on whether the teacher
can accurately identify students’ “Incorrect-reply”. For example, in Figure 2, if a student provides
an incorrect answer (e.g., “14”), a competent teacher should be able to recognize and point it out.
This process is objective and can be considered as a binary classification task.

Table 1: Teaching performances. For all metrics, the higher value denotes the better performance.
The best methods are highlighted in bold. The runner-up baselines are represented by underline.

(3) Correct Answer Recognition Accuracy (CARA): In contrast to error recognition, this dimension
focuses on whether the model can accurately identify students’ “Correct-reply”. Neglecting this
metric may mislead the LLMs to consider any answer provided by the student as incorrect.

(4) Successful Explanation Rate (SER): This dimension focuses on whether the model can provide
students with satisfactory explanations for their “Questioning”. This metric is subjective, but can be
converted to binary classification based on students’ real experience.

(5) Successful Rejection Rate (SRR): This metric is designed for the case where a teacher should
refuse to answer students’ “Irrelevant” questions and redirect them back to the instructional content.
Based on whether the model refuses to answer the question, it is also calculated as binary classification.

Compared with existing works in evaluating LLMs for education, our evaluation system offers three
main advantages. First, it provides a more comprehensive and adequate assessment. While previous
works either rely on similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU [43]) or limited-scale manual evaluations (e.g.,
issuing questionnaires [18]), our system assesses overall teaching quality along with four key teaching
abilities, which provides a more systematic organization of evaluation. Second, it enables better
comparability across LLMs. Limited by the fact that a student can only interact with one LLM at
a time, traditional human evaluations [5, 24] are difficult to compare the effectiveness of multiple
models. In contrast, our system uses the same teaching dialogues shared across different models as
test samples, allowing for a fair comparison of different LLMs simultaneously. Third, our system is
more extensive and reliable benefiting from our larger SocraTeach dataset, while recent studies rely
on smaller datasets, such as the latest one [40] with only around 600 testing dialogues.

Experiments

In this section, we verify the effectiveness of our SocraticLM by taking ChatGPT, GPT4, Vicuna-
7b [6], Llama2-7b, Llama2-13b, Llama3-8b [52], ChatGLM3-6b [12], and EduChat-32b [10] as
baselines. The implementation details are described in Appendix G. Especially, for fair comparison,
for the problems taught in the testing dialogues, we omit all of their dialogues in training. In addition
to our proposed evaluation system in Section 5, we also invite human annotators to give a real teacher
response for each testing dialogue, taking it as a standard to calculate the BLEU and Rouge.

6.1
Main Results

Table 1 summarizes the results for all models. First, our SocraticLM, which contains 6 billion
parameters, demonstrates a significant improvement in all Socratic teaching abilities. Notably, it
outperforms GPT4 by 12% on Overall, 6% on IARA, 7% on CARA, 9% on SER, and 23% on SRR, as
well as over 12% in mirroring the responses of human teachers as measured by BLEU and Rouge. In
Appendix H, we present and analyze examples of their outputs. Second, our SocraticLM demonstrates
a significant improvement in SER. This indicates that the judgement and correction of our proposed
Dean agent can critically boost the explanatory capabilities of large models when they function

Figure 3: Performances on problems with different number of step-by-step guiding questions.

as teachers. Third, in Figure 3, we evaluate the four teaching abilities on problems with different
numbers of step-by-step guiding questions, which can reflect the difficulty of the problems. It is
evident that our SocraticLM consistently outperforms GPT4 across all difficulty levels.

6.2
Ablation Study

Importance of Teaching Ability Enhancement. We explore the importance of single-round teaching
dialogues DiaS built for the four key teaching abilities in Section 3.4. From Table 1, we first observe a
significant decline (e.g., Overall Quality by 8%) when these dialogues are removed (i.e., “w/o DiaS”).
This illustrates the necessity of our teaching ability enhancement and confirms that our proposed four
teaching abilities are effective in meeting the real demands of Socratic teaching. Second, the IARA
and SRR metrics decrease the most, indicating the greatest disparity between the current LLM-based
teaching and human teaching may lie in the response to students’ incorrect answers and irrelevant
questions. Third, each time a type of single-round dialogue data is eliminated, all teaching abilities
will show a decline, which indicates that there is a coupling effect among different teaching abilities.
Especially, the CARA metric in the absence of dialogues for students’ “Correct-reply” (i.e., “w/o
Correct”) is even lower than when all single-round data is removed (“w/o DiaS”). We hold the reason
may be that in this case, SocraticLM was still fine-tuned on dialogues corresponding to students’
“Incorrect-reply”. This causes the model to develop a stronger tendency to perceive a student’s reply
as incorrect. This phenomenon further indicates that it is necessary to balance different types of
single-round dialogues to avoid overfitting on specific instructional patterns.

Table 2: Performance without problem-solving
data and three ability-balancing training strategies
in Section 4. ACCG, ACCM represent the accu-
racy on GSM8K and MAWPS, respectively.

Importance of Ability-balancing Strategies.
Here we discard the problem-solving data
and the three ability-balancing strategies in
Section 4 in training to investigate their in-
fluence.
From Table 2, fine-tuning without
problem-solving data (“w/o Problem”) will
result in a 31.2%/9.7% lower accuracy on
GSM8K/MAWPS compared with ChatGLM3-
6b. This could be attributed to the notable dif-
ferences between teaching dialogues and data
used for LLM pre-training, causing a dramatic
disturbance in the parameters. Besides, all three
training strategies are effective. Among them,
Separate Training/Instruction Tuning has the greatest influence on problem-solving/Socratic teaching
respectively. Mixed Prompt Setting might have already been employed in the LLM pre-training, hence
exhibiting less noticeable improvements. Moreover, it is worth noting that SocraticLM achieves
higher accuracy on MAWPS than ChatGLM3-6b. We speculate the reason is that, through fine-
tuning on our SocraTeach dataset, SocraticLM indeed learns to address multiple student questions
about various aspects of a single problem (e.g., asking about each reasoning step and the knowledge
involved). This process allows SocraticLM to develop a deeper understanding of the problem-solving
process, which in turn can improve its problem-solving accuracy.

6.3
Influence of Data Scale

Data scale is crucial for both the efficiency and effectiveness of training large language models.
In order to investigate this issue, in this section, we vary the amount of multi-round dialogues in
SocraTeach dataset and the ratio α between multi-round dialogues and problem-solving data.

Figure 4: Effects of dialogue scale.

Scale of Multi-round Dialogues. To study the impact of
different data scale, we randomly select 25%, 50%, 75% multi-
round dialogues from SocraTeach and expand it to 125% di-
alogues by running DTS pipeline more times to train Socrat-
icLM. The results in Figure 4 indicate that (i) Our data is not
only effective but also impactful at different scales, which can
significantly enhance the teaching capability of LLMs. (ii)
As the volume of data increases, we observe a corresponding
increase in the teaching ability. This correlation highlights the
importance of data quantity in model performance. Specifi-
cally, it is noteworthy that a minimum of 75% (≈26K) dia-
logues is required for surpassing the Overall Quality of GPT4. (iii) As the volume of data surpasses
the 35K threshold, it tends to approach a saturation point where further increases in data volume yield
smaller incremental benefits to the model’s capability. Specifically, at the 125% data scale, the IARA
metric shows a decline, indicating that the root cause of this saturation is a decrease in the model’s
ability to identify incorrect answers (the decline in Overall Quality is a subsequent result). This may
be because, with the increase in multi-round dialogue data, the proportion of single-round dialogue
data for “Incorrect reply” decreases. When multi-round data scale exceeds 125%, this proportion
may fall below a certain threshold, which results in diminishing effectiveness.

Figure 5: Effects of problem-solving
data scale.

Scale of Problem-solving Data. Figure 5 shows the perfor-
mance changes of SocraticLM as we adjust the ratio α between
problem-solving data and dialogue data. The trend indicates
that having too few or too much problem-solving data does not
lead to satisfactory problem-solving ability. Instead, a balance
needs to be struck with the teaching dialogue data. In fact,
an excessive introduction of problem-solving data may even
result in 1.9% decrease in accuracy on GSM8K. This could be
attributed to that the parameters corresponding to SocraticLM’
problem-solving ability might undergo disturbances after ini-
tial fine-tuning using the teaching dialogues. When retraining
with problem-solving data, it requires to re-strike a delicate
balance between underfitting and overfitting of this ability.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced SocraticLM, a LLM designed to facilitate Socratic “Thought-Provoking”
personalized teaching. To build SocraticLM, we proposed a “Dean-Teacher-Student” pipeline to
construct SocraTeach dataset, which simulated six student cognitive states and strengthened four
crucial teaching abilities. Besides, we developed a comprehensive teaching ability evaluation system
for LLMs. Experiments demonstrated that SocraticLM significantly outperforms current LLMs such
as GPT4 and validated the necessity of each component within the SocraTeach dataset. We discuss
more cases, the broader impacts, limitations, and future work in Appendix H, I, and J.

You are a primary school student, please refer to the dialogue and generate a possible 
response for me. In generating a response, you first need to choose one of the following 
SITUATIONs and then respond as a student who fits that situation, meeting the following 
criteria:
-
You are not a teacher, do not give any teacher reply! 
-
Don't ask questions about the people in the question. 
-
Your response should cohere with the given Dialogue.
SITUATIONs: (1) a student does not understand the meaning of the problem; (2) a student 
does not understand the content explained by the teacher; (3) a student makes error in 
calculation; (4) a student has poor knowledge mastery; (5) a student has weak thirst for 
knowledge; (6) a student has strong abilities in all aspects. 

Here are some examples: 
#Problem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips 
in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
#Dialogue: [Teacher]How many clips did Natalia sell in May?\n[Student]I'm not good at math. 
Can you explain it again?\n[Teacher]Not a problem at all. Let's break it down. If Natalia sold 
half as many clips in May as she did in April, and she sold 48 clips in April, then how many 
clips will she have sold in May? Let's take the number from April and half it. What do you get?
#Response:Choose SITUATION (3)[Student]I get it, the half of 48 is 240.

B.2: Prompt of Teacher Agent

I am a primary school student. You are a teacher that always responds in the Socratic style. 
You could not give me the answer but always try to ask just the right question to help me learn 
to think for myself. You need to break the problem down into simpler parts until it's at the 
right level for me. Please explain the above steps to me in the form of questions, starting with 
[Step 1]. If you think you have finished teaching, please put \"[END]\" at the end of your 
response.

(Choose one of the following examples according to Student's SITUATION): 
(SITUATION 1)
#Problem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips 
in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
#Steps: [step 1] How many clips did Natalia sell in May?\n[step 2] How many clips did 
Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
#Dialogue:[Teacher]: How many clips did Natalia sell in May?\n[Student]: I'm confused. 
Does \"half as many\" mean the same number as April?
#Response:[Teacher]: In fact, \"half as many\" means half of the number. So if Natalia sold 48 
clips in April, how many clips did she sell in May?

(SITUATION 2)
#Problem: Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many 
coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?
#Steps: [step 1] How many mango trees does Randy have?\n[step 2] How many coconut trees 
does Randy have?\n[Step 3] How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?
#Dialogue:[Teacher]: How many mango trees does Randy have?\n[Student]: You mean how 
many are there totally or just mango?
#Response:[Teacher]: We're talking about just the mango trees now. So, considering just the 
mango trees, can you tell me how many Randy has according to the problem?

B.3: Prompt of Dean Agent

You are a teaching director. The following is the teaching process of a Socratic teacher. Please 
evaluate the response of [Teacher] in the last round and judge whether it meets the following 
teaching criteria:
-
If the [Student] is asking a commonsense or struggles to understand a concept, the 
[Teacher] is allowed to give direct explanation.
-
In other cases, no direct answer or solution to the problem can be given in a declarative or 
rhetorical manner.
-
If [Student] makes a mistake, it is necessary to imply by way of question what error he/she 
made.
-
[Teacher] needs to speak like a teacher and does not use phrases like \"let me ask you\".
-
The response must be smooth and fluent.

If you think the response meets the criteria, please reply [True], otherwise reply [False], 
explain your judgement and modify it according to the criteria.

#Dialogue:[Teacher]: How many clips did Natalia sell in May?\n[Student]: I'm confused. 
Does \"half as many\" mean the same number as April?\n[Teacher]: Not exactly, \"half as 
many\" means half the amount. If Natalia sold 48 clips in April, what would be half of 48? 
That would tell us how many she sold in May. Can you solve that?

divided by 2? So, 72?\n[Teacher]: You're on the right track, dividing by 2 to figure out the 
number of clips sold in May. But let me ask you this: does the 48 add to 48 divided by 2, or do 
you divide 48 by 2 on its own first?
#Response:[False].The [Teacher]’s response is incorrect and does not point out that the 
[Student] made a calculation error. [Modified Teacher]: You're on the right track! But you 
may make a mistake in calculations. Can you calculate again what is the result of 48 plus 48

36?\n[Teacher]: You're on the right track thinking about percentages, but remember when we 
say someone is \"40 percent younger\", we need to subtract that percentage from 100%. Can 
you revisit your calculation with this in mind?
#Response:[False]. The [Student] correctly gets the answer of “How old is Betty's daughter” 
but the [Teacher] still asks the same question. [Modified Teacher]: Yes! You have got the 
correct result of Betty’s daughter’s age. Now you can calculate how old is Betty's 
granddaughter. Can you have a try?

More Details about Teaching Ability Enhancement

To build single-round dialogues for “Irrelevant” student response, we first randomly select 2, 000
dialogues from DiaM constructed by DTS pipeline. From each dialogue, we randomly select one
round of Student’s response and replace it with a randomly selected question from the 200 questions
collected from MOOCs. We then use Teacher agent to refuse answering the question under the
supervision of Dean, finally forming 2, 000 single-round Student-Teacher dialogues.

obtain two new Student’s responses. On the other hand, we use GPT4 to rewrite the original Student’s
response and generate three incorrect answers using prompt in C.2. With these five responses, we
prompt the Teacher to response and obtain 10K Student-Teacher dialogues.

Statistics of SocraTeach Dataset

As stated in Section 3.5, our SocraTeach consists of 35K multi-round dialogues DiaM and 22K
single-round dialogues DiaS. The average number of rounds in DiaM is 5.28. On average, the Stu-
dent/Teacher’s responses contain 16.4/30.3 words respectively. The overall statistics is summarized
in Table 3. Moreover, from Figure 6(a), most teaching dialogues consist of 5-6 rounds. In Figure 6(b),
we visualize the probability mass function of Student’s cognitive states in SocraTeach, where (1)-(5)
correspond to a student portrait that performs poor in one of the dimensions in our proposed student
cognitive system (Section 3.3), while (6) corresponds to a student with strong states in all dimensions.
It can be seen that the Student agent tends to simulate a student who is excellent in all aspects or
alternatively, has problems in calculation ability (i.e., “(3)”) or knowledge mastery (i.e., “(4)”).

Human Evaluation for Teaching Quality

To evaluate the Overall Quality of different LLMs, we recruit 10 well-educated annotators to rank the
instructions provided by each model compared with GPT4. Figure 8 shows the template.

Teaching Quality Evaluation

1. Read the following dialogue in which a teacher explains a mathematical problem to a student.
2. For the students' last round of response, rate which teacher's instruction is better from four aspects:
•
Understanding: Assess whether the teacher correctly understands the student's intention.
•
Explanation: Whether the teacher effectively solves the students' problem and provides 
appropriate and actionable guidance.
•
Language: Evaluate whether the teacher's instruction conforms to the demands of Socratic 
teaching, including that it is presented as a question and does not give a direct answer.
•
Readability: Assess whether the teacher's instruction is easy to read and not too blunt.

#Problem: In a store, an Uno Giant Family Card costs $12. When Ivan bought ten pieces, he was 
given a discount of $2 each. How much did Ivan pay in all?
#Answer: 100.
#Analysis: Instead of $12 each, an Uno Giant Family Card costs $12 - $2 = 10 each. Ivan paid $10 x 
10 = 100 for the ten pieces Uno Giant Family Card.
#Steps: (1) How much does an Uno Giant Family Card cost?
(2) How much did Ivan pay in all?
#Dialogue history:
[Teacher]: How much does an Uno Giant Family Card cost? 
[Student]: Why do we have to calculate discounts? 
[Teacher]: Great question! When you buy something at discount, you pay less than the original cost. 
So, the original cost of an Uno Giant Family Card helps us understand how much money Ivan saved 
from the discount. Now, knowing this, can you try to find out how much Ivan paid in all after the 
discount? 
[Student]: I don't understand. How does the discount change the cost of each card? 

[Teacher A]: 
The discount is like a reduction in the card's original price. In this instance, if the original price of 
each card is $12 and there's a discount of $2, you'd subtract the discount from the original price. So, 
the new cost of each card would be $12 - $2. What would that be? 

[Teacher B]: 
That's a great question! When we say \"discount\", we mean a reduction in the original price. So, if 
Ivan was given a discount of $2 for each of his ten Uno Giant family cards, how much did he pay for 
each one?

Implementation Details

Our SocraticLM is obtained by P-Tuning [36] ChatGLM3-6b (not ChatGLM3-6b-Base) for 2
epochs with a learning rate of 0.02 and batch size of 64. For dataset partition, as described in
Section 5, the testing set is composed of 400 single-round dialogues for evaluating objective teaching
ability (i.e., IARA, CARA, SER, SRR) and 1, 000 multiple-round dialogues for evaluating subjective
Overall Quality. Of the remaining data in SocraTeach, 10%/90% is used for validation/training. All
experiments are conducted on a server with six NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. Our dataset and code is
available at https://github.com/Ljyustc/SocraticLM.

Additional Model Samples

In the following, we present four samples of our SocraticLM and GPT4 for students’ “Incorrect-
reply”, “Correct-reply”, “Questioning” and “Irrelevant” response respectively. In the first example,
both SocraticLM and GPT4 identify the student’s mistake, but GPT4 gives the answer “7” directly,
which contradicts the demands of Socratic teaching. In the second example, GPT4 also gives an
almost complete solution process, which does not meet the requirements of step-by-step Socratic
guidance of thinking. In the third example, GPT4’s expression is more stilted and lacks the sense
of a real human teacher. In the fourth example, SocraticLM redirects the student to solve the math
problem first, while GPT4 is shifted to answer the irrelevant question.

Sample 1: Incorrect-reply

#Problem: Brenda's mother made cookies for 5 . If she prepared 35 cookies and each of them 
had the same number of cookies , how many did each of them have ?
#Dialogue history:
[Teacher]: How can we calculate the number of cookies each person gets?
[Student]: Can't you just divide it for me?
[Teacher]: Well, you could just do that, but it's important to understand why we divide. 
Dividing allows us to equally distribute something amongst a certain number of people or 
things. In this case, if Brenda's mother made 35 cookies for 5 people, how would you divide 
those cookies so that each person gets the same amount?
[Student]: Oh, do we just divide the total number of cookies by the total number of people?
[Teacher]: That's right! Now using this method, how many cookies does each person get if 
Brenda's mother made 35 cookies for 5 people?
[Student]: I'm not sure. What is 35 divided by 5?
[Teacher]: Good question! Let's think about it. If you have 5 groups, and you need to 
distribute 35 items equally, how many would go in each group? You can start by seeing how 
many times 5 can fit into 35 without going over. Can you try to do that?
[Student]: So does that mean each person gets 8 cookies?

SocraticLM: 
That's a good start! But let's double-check. If you divide 35 by 5, what do you get?

GPT4:
Not quite. If you visualize a group of 35 objects, and you divide it into 5 equal groups, you 
would see that each group actually contains 7 objects. In this case, each person would get 7 
cookies. Does that make sense?

Sample 2: Correct-reply

Sample 3: Questioning

#Problem: Matias is a salesman in a bookstore. He sold 7 books on Tuesday and three times 
as many on Wednesday. If the sales from Wednesday were tripled on Thursday, how many 
books did Matias sell during these three days combined?
#Dialogue history:
[Teacher]: How many books did Matias sell on Wednesday?
[Student]: What are you asking? 

SocraticLM: 
Let's break it down. If Matias sold 7 books on Tuesday, and he sold three times as many on 
Wednesday, how many books did he sell on Wednesday?

GPT4:
How many books did Matias sell on Tuesday? And if he sold three times more on Wednesday, 
can you calculate how many books that would be?

[Student]: Does \"makes\" include the ones he eats or not?
[Teacher]: When we say \"Jeff makes\", we're referring to the total number of donuts Jeff 
creates, whether he eats them or not. So, how many donuts in total did Jeff make?
[Student]: Jeff makes 10 donuts each day and he made donuts for 12 days, so he made 120 
donuts in total. 
[Teacher]: That's correct! Now, how many donuts does Jeff eat? 
[Student]: Jeff eats 12 donuts because he has one each day and he made donuts for 12 days. 

SocraticLM: 
Excellent! Now, if Jeff eats 12 donuts and he made 120 donuts in total, how many donuts are 
left after he eats?

GPT4:
Exactly! Now, there is another character introduced in the problem named Chris. How many 
donuts does Chris eat? Given that Chris eats 8 donuts, how we calculate the total number of 
remaining donuts? Once we have the total number of remaining donuts, what do we do to find 
out the number of boxes required? Now, can you calculate the number of boxes that can Jeff 
needs to store all of his remaining donuts?

#Problem: Solomon collected three times as many cans as Juwan. Levi collected half of what 
Juwan collected. Solomon collected 66 cans. How many cans did the boys collect in all?
#Dialogue history:
[Teacher]: How many cans did Juwan collect?
[Student]: How to study grammar?

SocraticLM: 
That's a great question! But let's first figure out how many cans Juwan collected. If Solomon 
collected three times as many cans as Juwan, and Solomon collected 66 cans, can you 
calculate how many cans Juwan collected?

GPT4:
That's an entirely different topic, but I can help. Study of grammar means understanding the 
structure of a language. We have verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. in a sentence. 
Understanding how these work together is studying grammar. Have you tried reading about 
grammar before?

Broader Impacts

In this paper, we propose a large language model SocraticLM to achieve Socratic teaching, which is
a crucial pedagogy in intelligent education and has a significant impact on our daily lives. On the
one hand, as explained in Section 3.3 and 3.4, our SocraticLM can provide instructions to students
with different cognitive states and various types of responses. Therefore, it can support multiple
personalized applications in classrooms and online platforms, delivering high-quality instructions
more efficiently and conveniently to students from various backgrounds, thus promoting educational
equity and rapid development. On the other hand, in our work, we use GPT4 to simulate conversations
between teachers and students to generate dialogue data, entirely without the involvement of real
human teachers or students. This approach provides a way to collect data without interacting with
or testing on real humans, reducing the burden of human interaction while also avoiding privacy,
security, and other ethical concerns. However, since our model needs to be trained with multi-round
teaching dialogue data, in order to expand to more subjects (e.g., physics), it may require more
educational resources (e.g., problems in textbooks) and training costs.

J
Limitations and Future Work

First, from Table 1, the SER metric of SocraticLM and GPT4 is 0.74 and 0.65, respectively. This
shows that the current models have room for improvement in their ability to respond to real and
complex student questions. Second, we focus on the teaching of mathematical problems in this paper.
For other subjects, we need additional data construction and training processes. Third, the testset of
problem-solving ability in this paper is the problems that our Socratic teaching dialogues are based on
(i.e. GSM8K and MAWPS). In order to more accurately assess the changes in reasoning ability, we
will test additional datasets and explore ability-balancing training strategies for more tasks. Finally,
in this paper, we use ChatGLM3-6b, an open source large language model as our base to construct
SocraticLM, because it is easy to fine-tune and has not been pre-trained with teaching capabilities,
which can better verify the effect of our SocraTeach dataset. In the future, we will use our dataset to
fine-tune more LLMs and explore their potential for teaching and intelligent education.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have clearly explained the scope of this paper and listed the contributions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present a "Limitations and Future Work" section in Appendix J to discuss
the limitations of our work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe in details the construction process of our dataset in the main
paper, all prompts used in this paper in Appendix A, B, C, and E, and the setups needed to
reproduce the experimental results in Appendix G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

24


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Ljyustc/
SocraticLM.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly describe the dataset splits, hyperparameters, training methods, and
GPU devices in Appendix G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This paper evaluates the quality of Socratic teaching by human annotators. In
order to ensure the consistency of annotators, we calculate the Kappa score and the result is
0.70, which ensures the credibility of our results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We present the computation resources in Appendix G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We present a "Border Impacts" section in Appendix I to discuss the potential
positive/negative societal impacts of our work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

26


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The assets including data and baseline models used in this paper are properly
cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

27


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly introduce the new dataset in our paper and provide its documentation
in the link https://github.com/Ljyustc/SocraticLM.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the full template given to the human annotators in Appendix F.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In this paper, we invite human annotators only to assess LLMs’ outputs (i.e.,
give ratings). The annotators themselves are not the subjects of the evaluation and are not
being tested. Besides, as shown our annotation template in Appendix F, this evaluation
process does not collect personal information or privacy of the annotators, and the annotators
are fully aware of the purpose of the evaluation and have consented to its use.

Guidelines:

28


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
