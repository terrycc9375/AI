Abstract

Since deep learning models are usually deployed in non-stationary environments, it
is imperative to improve their robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. A com-
mon approach to mitigate distribution shift is to regularize internal representations
or predictors learned from in-distribution (ID) data to be domain invariant. Past
studies have primarily learned pairwise invariances, ignoring the intrinsic structure
and high-order dependencies of the data. Unlike machines, humans recognize
objects by first dividing them into major components and then identifying the
topological relation of these components. Motivated by this, we propose Recon-
struct and Match (REMA), a general learning framework for object recognition
tasks to endow deep models with the capability of capturing the topological ho-
mogeneity of objects without human prior knowledge or fine-grained annotations.
To identify major components from objects, REMA introduces a selective slot-
based reconstruction module to dynamically map dense pixels into a sparse and
discrete set of slot vectors in an unsupervised manner. Then, to model high-order
dependencies among these components, we propose a hypergraph-based relational
reasoning module that models the intricate relations of nodes (slots) with structural
constraints. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that REMA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in OOD generalization and test-time adaptation settings.

Introduction

Distribution shift has emerged as a major challenge for the success of machine learning systems [34,
25]. Although deep learning models are believed to generalize well to in-distribution (ID) data, a
well-trained model deployed in the open world often encounters out-of-distribution (OOD) data whose
contexts may differ from the training distribution, resulting in dramatic performance degeneration
and raising concerns about model safety in many high-staking applications, such as autonomous
driving and medical diagnosis. This gives rise to the importance of OOD generalization [92, 76],
which aims to build a robust learning machine that can perform well in unseen test environments.

Regarding OOD generalization, a central theme is how to learn general features from training data
that can be extrapolated to test distributions. Following this idea, a plethora of OOD generalization
methods have been proposed over the past few years, including domain alignment [42], latent feature
disentanglement [61, 48, 85], meta-learning [40, 41], invariant risk minimization [2, 1, 96], and
augmentation-guided invariant predictor [74, 83, 95], to name a few. On the other hand, given the
natural adaptivity gap between training and test distributions [15], recent works [29, 30, 81, 11, 8]
attempt to further enhance the source-trained model through test-time adaptation [46], which leverages
unlabeled target samples to update the model in an online manner. These two series of studies address
distribution shifts during training and inference and have been proven to work synergistically [8].

Figure 1: Motivation of the proposed REMA. (a) Ideally, by partitioning the latent factors into
common and specific parts, aligning the common factors directly enables perfect matching of two
different distributions. (b) Since the latent features learned by deep networks are typically dense
and continuous, most well-performing methods seek direct alignment without exploring the inherent
structures. (c) Our REMA introduces a sparse and discrete element – slot [51] – to serve as a bridge
for both reconstruction and relational modeling, avoiding explicit disentanglement in the latent space.

Albeit their general efficacy for various tasks, these prior efforts largely overlook the topological
structure of the image data. As a consequence, existing OOD generalization methods highly rely on
specialized regularization objectives and are significantly less interpretable than human vision systems.
Unlike machines, human object recognition [4] typically involves initially decomposing objects into
several major components (e.g., keypoints), followed by identifying the structural relationships
among these components, and finally making predictions by comprehensively considering the main
components and their inherent relations. To this end, a critical question remains open in the field:

How to devise a unified framework that imitates the human vision process for OOD generalization?

In this work, we believe that OOD generalization requires consideration of two key aspects: 1) how
to represent the structure of data, and 2) how to model the relationships between different entities.

Grounded on these insights, we propose Reconstruct and Match (REMA), a general framework to
endow deep models with the capability of capturing the topological homogeneity of objects without
using human prior knowledge or fine-grained attribute annotations. Figure 1 illustrates the motivation.
To identify major components from objects, REMA introduces a slot-based reconstruction module
to map dense pixels into a sparse set of slot vectors in an unsupervised manner. This module
encourages the deep model to reduce unwanted redundancy and preserve those predominant parts
(the words “component” and “part” are used interchangeably). Then, to model and reason the high-
order dependencies among these components, we propose a hypergraph-based matching module that
discovers the relations of slots with structural constraints, i.e., topological homogeneity of the object.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

• We propose REMA, a novel OOD generalization framework to mitigate distribution shifts
in deep learning models by imitating the human visual recognition process.

• We introduce a self-supervised reconstruction process to identify informative parts from
objects without additional supervision, and a hypergraph matching module to reason the
high-order part-based object relationships and interactions across domains.

• Experiments on six widely used benchmarks demonstrate that REMA outperforms state-of-
the-art methods in OOD generalization and test-time adaptation settings.

of OOD generalization is to find a predictor f : X 7→Y that generalizes well to all unseen target
domains. In deep neural networks, empirical risk minimization (ERM) [72] is capable of learning
highly predictive features, making it the simplest baseline for this problem.

where P tr is the training distribution, Θ denotes the parameter space, and ℓis the loss function. The
trained model will be evaluated on a test set from a test distribution P ts, where P tr ̸= P ts.

Proposed Method

In this section, we provide a detailed description of our Reconstruct and Match (REMA) framework.
As shown in Figure 2, REMA consists of two key modules tackling the main component discovery
(Section 3.1) and high-order relational modeling and reasoning (Section 3.2).

3.1
On Discovering Main Components

For OOD generalization/adaptation, a long-standing issue is how to distinguish between transferable
(domain-agnostic) and non-transferable (domain-related) information in the data. An ideal solution is
to disentangle latent representations in an unsupervised manner (see Fig. 1(a)), which has been proven
to be prohibitively difficult and even infeasible [50]. Therefore, most prior works (see Fig. 1(b))
aim to learn domain-invariant representations through elaborate feature alignment modules, such as
adversarial training [21] and pseudo-labeling [37], without exploring the intrinsic composition of the
features themselves. Despite their general efficacy, these methods may introduce a significant amount
of redundant and noisy information during the alignment process. For humans, when identifying
an object, we tend to first look for its main components, which can be regarded as a process of
information compression from a learning perspective. Inspired by this, we aim to mimic the very
first step of the human recognition process by identifying the main components from object images
without human prior knowledge or fine-grained annotations.

To be specific, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction module based on Slot Attention [51],
termed Selective Slot-based Reconstruction (SSR), to assist deep models in learning a set of part-based
representations for sparsely characterizing a target object. Formally, given an input x, g extracts a set
of feature embeddings z ∈RN×dz, where N is the number of embedding and dz denotes embedding
dimension. The Slot Attention module will first take a set of slots s ∈RK×ds (K is the number of
slots) and the feature map z, then project them to dimension ds by a linear transformation fk for slots

and fq, fv for z. The Slot Attention will be trained as follows,

update(A, v) = AT v, Aij =
attn(q, k)ij
PK
l=1 attn(q, k)lj
, attn(q, k) =
eMij
PN
l=1 eMil , M = kqT

√ds
,
(2)

where q = fq(z) ∈RK×ds, k = fk(z) ∈RN×ds, and v = fv(z) ∈RN×ds denote the query, key
and value vectors respectively. A ∈RN×K stands for the attention matrix. Unlike self-attention, the
queries in slot attention are a function of the slots s ∼N(s; µ, σ) ∈RK×ds, and will be updated
iteratively over T iterations. The slots are initialized by random sampling from a standard Gaussian
distribution. Queries at iteration t are represented by ˆqt = fq(st), and the slot updating process is:
st+1 := update(attn(ˆqt, k), v). After each iteration, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is employed
on the slot representations st+1 to update their states, integrating new information while retaining
relevant context from previous iterations.

Since the number of slots K is manually predefined and fixed during training, attention networks
may learn redundant or even incorrect associations, thus affecting the understanding of objects
and scenes. Therefore, our SSR introduces a selective slot attention mechanism that dynamically
adjusts the importance of slots for reconstruction. To quantitatively represent which slots are more
important for reconstruction, we first introduce an importance score ρ for each slot. For each slot
si, we use a lightweight neural network hθ to predict an initial importance score: ρinit
i
= σ(hθ(si)),
where σ(·) is the sigmoid function, ensuring ρinit
i
∈[0, 1]. To capture interactions among slots,
we further introduce an interaction matrix W ∈RK×K, where each element Wij is defined as

Wij = softmaxj

(Usi)⊤(V sj)/
√

d

. Here, U and V are learnable projection matrices, and d is a

scaling factor. The final importance score ρi for each slot si is then computed as ρi = PK
j=1 Wijρinit
j .
We then scale each slot representation by its respective importance score to create a weighted slot
representation ˜si = ρi · si. To this end, the overall training objective of SSR can be formulated as:

LSSR = ∥ˆx −x∥2
2 + λ

K
X

i=1

ρinit
2 ,
(3)

where λ is the balancing parameter. The regularization term encourages sparsity in the initial
importance scores, guiding the model to utilize only the most relevant slots for reconstruction. On the
other hand, the less relevant slots are down-weighted rather than discarded, which may help retain
subtle information. Compared to continuous semantic representations, this training process is more
manageable due to the discretization of the slots. Since we lack truly fine-grained annotations, the
learned slots or “concepts” may not be as readily interpretable as individual words. It is worth noting
that incorporating a strong visual feature extractor could significantly boost baseline performance.
However, for the sake of fairness, we have opted not to use approaches, such as DINOSAUR [64].

3.2
High-Order Relational Reasoning (HORR)

Albeit we have obtained part-based representations in the form of slots, their inner- and inter-
object relations are still under-explored. Prior graph-based [9, 7] and non-graph [33] works only
accommodate pairwise relationships (e.g., connection between two nodes in a simple graph), but are
inadequate to model the high-order relations inherent in images. Addressing this issue, we introduce a
simple yet effective technique—HORR—to model high-order topological relations with a collection
of graph nodes and hyperedges, divided into three stages: construction, learning, and matching.

Definition 1 (Topological Homogeneity) We conceptualize topological homogeneity between the
same object across images as a (hyper)graph matching problem, which is mathematically formulated
as a relaxed quadratic assignment problem [52],

min
X ∥A −XBXT ∥2
F −tr(XT
u X),

X ∈[0, 1]n×m, X1n ≤1m, XT 1m ≤1n,
(4)

where A ∈Rn×n and B ∈Rm×m are the adjacent matrix encoding structure information of the
graph GA and GB respectively, n and m are the number of graph nodes, || · ||F is the Frobenius norm,
Xu ∈Rm×n is the unary affinity matrix and generally specified as the node affinity Maff, and X is
the relaxed permutation matrix encoding node-to-node assignment.

---Page Break---
Hypergraph Construction. Given visual slot representations from the previous step, we carry out a
linear transformation to obtain graph nodes VA and VB. This transformation is intended to map the
visual features into the graph domain, ensuring effective graph matching. Then, we build hypergraph
graphs GA and GB in both domains, modeling the topological structures inherent in the images, xA
and xB, respectively. The hypergraph [17] is defined as: GA/B = (VA/B, EA/B, W), where VA/B is
the node sets, EA/B is the hyperedge sets, and W ∈R|E|×|E| is a diagonal matrix of edge weights.
The hypergraph is denoted by an incidence matrix H ∈R|V|×|E|, where H(v, e) = 1 indicates the
node v ∈e and H(v, e) = 0 indicates v /∈e. We adopt non-parametric density estimation, i.e.,
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to establish hyperedge connections. The Euclidean distance is used to
calculate the distance between node embeddings.

Hypergraph Learning. After constructing the hypergraphs, we update the graph node features
according to the connectivity defined by the hyperedges. Technically, we introduce hypergraph
convolution [17] to perform message-passing and feature aggregation,

˜V = D−1/2
v
HWD−1
e HT D−1/2
v
Θ,
(5)

where Θ represents the parameter to be learned during training. By doing so, we can explicitly model
intricate correlations among different parts of an image (i.e., slots). On the other hand, in contrast to
grids, sequences, and even graphs, this high-order modeling can more effectively capture relations
among nodes, avoiding excessive or erroneous pairwise connections.

Hypergraph Matching. Since the graph node features have been updated by Eq. (5), we introduce
an affinity matrix Waff to measure the node correspondence between GA and GB. Following [19, 44],
we use the differentiable Sinkhorn layer [67] to calculate the affinity matrix ˆ
Waff, where each element
indicates the degree of matching between pairs of nodes across graphs. To leverage the topological
structures, we need a training objective to minimize the pairwise structural discrepancy between the
hypergraphs [78]. In particular, we follow the Definition 1 to specify unary affinity matrix Xu as
the obtained node affinity matrix ˆ
Waff. Since the constructed hypergraphs naturally encode rich
high-order relationships, they enhance the cross-domain topological matching process. Conversely,
the matching process introduces additional structural knowledge to the current graph through message
propagation. Formally, the hypergraph-based matching objective is formulated as follows:

Lmat =

(6)

where the (i, j) element in YΠ ∈Rn×m is 1 if vA
i ∈GA and vB
j ∈GB belong to the same object
class, otherwise it will be 0. Here, YΠ can be regarded as pseudo labels for matching due to the
absence of ground-truth correspondence. Moreover, as the matching primarily targets high-level
semantic relationships, we avoid imposing additional structural constraints [23, 43, 44] on this
training objective, thereby significantly simplifying the training process.

3.3
Training and Inference

Putting everything together, the full training objective is formulated as follows:

LREMA = LCE + αLSSR + βLmat,
(7)

where α and β are hyper-parameters for balancing different loss terms. Our algorithm first trains
deep models using the reconstruction objective to obtain discrete part representations with sufficient
sparsity. Then it turns to model the cross-image components correlations as the graph matching
problem where we further introduce the structural regularization term into the matching loss.

Note that our approach can be directly applied to test-time adaptation, similar to those self-supervised
methods [69, 49, 3, 20]. The difference lies in the fact that their proxy tasks are somewhat heuristic,
such as predicting rotations, jigsaw puzzles, and random masking. In contrast, our method directly
exploits the intrinsic structured properties of the data, making it more robust and versatile.

Experiments

In this section, we empirically evaluate the proposed REMA in two types of OOD scenarios, i.e.,
OOD generalization and test-time adaptation. In the following, we first describe the experimental
setup (Section 4.1) and then provide the main results (Section 4.2) and ablation studies (Section 4.3).

4.1
Experimental Setup

Datasets. For OOD generalization, we leverage the three most widely used benchmark datasets.
PACS [39] comprises 9,991 images and exhibits significant variations in image styles. It consists
of 4 domains each with 7 classes, i.e., Photo, Art Painting, Cartoon, Sketch. VLCS con-
tains 10,729 images of 5 classes from 4 photographic domains: PASCAL VOC 2007, LabelMe,
Caltech, Sun. Office-Home [73] is collected from both office and home environments, and its do-
main shifts stem from variations in viewpoint and image style. It has 15,500 images of 65 classes from
4 domains, i.e., Artistic, Clipart, Product, Real World. Regarding test-time adaptation,
we follow the common benchmarks [75, 30, 79] that utilize CIFAR-10/100 [35] and ImageNet [14]
as the ID (training) data. CIFAR-10/100C [26] and Imagenet-C [26] are used as OOD (test) data,
comprising different corruptions applied to their original datasets.

Implementation Details. For OOD generalization, we use ResNet-50 for PACS, Office-Home, and
VLCS and ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with
momentum 0.9, and weight decay 10−4. The training batch size is set to 128. The learning rate is
10−4. Following common practice, the model selection is based on a training domain validation set.
For test-time adaptation, we use ResNet-50 for all datasets. We utilize the Adam optimizer to update
the network parameters. To facilitate a fair comparison, the test batch size of 64 in all methods. λ in
Eq. (3) is set to 0.01 in all experiments. α and β in Eq. (7) is set to 10 and 0.1, respectively.

Baselines. We compare REMA against two types of baseline methods. (1) OOD Generalization:
We adopt the leave-one-domain-out evaluation protocol and follow the model selection strategy
used in [25]. The main baselines have optimization-based CORAL [68], MLDG [40], CDANN [45]
and MMD [42], augmentation-based Mixstyle [95], SagNet [55] and I-Mixup [80, 82, 84], and so
on. (2) Test-time adaptation: All methods are based on online batch-level test data adaptation
setting and the following baselines are included: entropy-minimization: Tent [75] and SHOT [47],
pseudo-labeling: T3A [29] and TAST [31], consistency-alignment: TSD [79] and TIPI [56].

Main Results

OOD Generalization. The main results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 3. Notably, REMA
consistently outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin in each dataset. For example,
compared to the recent method VNE, REMA improves classification accuracy by 1.8% for PACS,
6.1% for Office-Home, and 1.3% for VLCS, revealing the importance of our reconstruction (semantic
abstraction) and matching (topological homogeneity) modules. Moreover, there are two notable
observations: (1) Compared to statistical matching methods (e.g., CORAL, DANN, and MMD) that
directly optimize moment matching objectives in the latent space, REMA demonstrates superior
performance by introducing topological information with more sparse input (slots). (2) Style or
data augmentation based methods (e.g., MixStyle) is simple and easy-to-implement. However, their
intuitive nature of interpolating around the training set may not accurately cover the target distribution
region. By contrast, REMA directly learns major components from training data. (3) Compared to
PACS and VLCS datasets, the Office-Home dataset has more categories and total samples. Many
baseline approaches even perform worse than ERM, indicating their limited scalability. Instead,
REMA demonstrates a larger performance gain in this challenging task.

Test-Time Adaptation. We compared REMA with existing advanced TTA methods, and the results
are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. REMA consistently provides improvements on multiple
datasets. Compared to TSD [79], it achieves a 1.3% improvement on three pixel-level corruption
datasets and a 3.1% improvement on three challenging cross-domain datasets. Compared to the SOTA,
REMA has three major advantages: (1) Tent [75] or SHOT [47] based on entropy minimization has
limitations, as they can overcome distribution shifts caused by pixel corruption but fail to handle
cross-domain test data, even leading to performance degradation. However, REMA can handle

capturing higher-order semantic dependencies. (3) REMA converts dense pixels into sparse slots,
accurately capturing domain-invariant features, which will not be affected by pixel corruption and
domain shift. Implementing consistent optimization during test time makes REMA more robust,
resulting in a 5.1% accuracy improvement across all benchmarks, i.e., ERM vs. REMA.

Ablations of key modules in REMA. In this
part, we provide the ablation results in Table 4,
investigating the independent and combined ef-
fects of SSR and HORR proposed in REMA.
As can be seen, incorporating SSR and HORR
separately leads to improved generalization per-
formance, demonstrating their contributions to
abstraction and relational modeling. In addition,
integrating SSR and HORR in our method yields the best performance, highlighting that the two
modules systematically work together and reciprocate each other. Moreover, as shown in Figure 4(a),
the full REMA can provide more complete and accurate representations of objects.

Analysis on continuous test-time adaptation. We empirically
evaluate the continuous learning ability of REMA by comparing
it with state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, namely
Tent [75], EATA [57], and DeYO [38]. The results are pre-
sented in Fig. 4(b), where the adaptation order is from left to
right. We can see that the proposed REMA substantially and
consistently outperforms all baseline methods as adaptation
proceeds, revealing the robustness and the capability to handle
open-world changes.

Analysis on hypergraph matching. In Figure 5, we visual-
ize the learned doubly stochastic node affinity matrix and the
ground-truth (GT) matrix. We observe that the proposed graph
matching method effectively identifies the correct node affinity,
revealing its effectiveness in handling cross-domain higher-order relationships.

Feature visualization. Figure 6 demonstrates the t-SNE [71] visualization of feature embeddings
for ERM, REMA w/o SSR, REMA w/o HORR, and REMA (Full). We extract feature embeddings
using CIFAR-10C data, where the corruption type is snow with a severity level of 5. The different
color stands for different classes. We can observe that our REMA exhibits better clustering patterns
with both SSR and HORR modules. When SSR is removed, some closely related categories (e.g.,
animals) become highly mixed, indicating the advantage of SSR in extracting robust semantic
representations. On the other hand, without HORR, intra-class variations increase, indicating some
degree of ambiguity between different categories. Our HORR addresses semantic ambiguity by
modeling topological homogeneity.

Related Work

OOD Generalization. The aim of OOD Generalization is to train a model using data from the
source distribution so that it can perform well on an unknown target distribution. A series of works
can be divided into three categories: (1) Minimizing distribution differences [42, 45, 68, 90]: using
meta-learning to simulate distribution shift [40, 18], or learning an invariant transformation based on
adversarial learning [42, 45, 89, 94, 93]. (2) Domain-invariant representation learning: by analyzing
the feature learning process of deep neural networks [16, 66, 27, 63, 12, 13], it is inferred how ID
data can be generalized to OOD data [6, 65]. By understanding the interactions between ERM and
generalization, domain-invariant features are learned. (3) More generic OOD generalization: many
studies focus on generalization under a relaxed assumption, such as open environments with unknown
classes [8], semi-supervised settings in the testing environment [86], adapting foundation models [91],
and OOD data synthesis [60, 59, 22], aiming to identify generalizable features from sophisticated
test distributions. However, previous studies have only focused on the instances themselves and have
not explored the inherent high-order semantic dependencies in ID and OOD data, overlooking the
topological homogeneity between distributions.

Test-time Adaptation. The goal of TTA [46] is to adjust the source trained model using test data
without ground truth during the testing phase [47, 58, 10, 87, 79, 29]. Most of the existing methods
directly perform gradient optimization on the test samples, with optimization objectives including
prediction entropy [75], self-training and stochastic restoring [77], or based on normalization [54],
etc., making the model adapt to the dynamic target environment at each step. Recently works further
consider the scenario of noisy outlier samples [24, 70] appearing in the test stream. However, previous
studies have simply optimized the test instances based on self-training, ignoring the topological
relationship between samples and the high-order semantic dependencies within the test data steam,
leading to suboptimal adaptation.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose to achieve out-of-distribution robustness from the perspective of ensuring
topological homogeneity between the same object class regardless of the surrounding environments.
To achieve this goal, we propose a new framework REMA to first obtain a set of sparse and discrete
representations from dense pixels and then model the high-order topological relations and depen-
dencies via hypergraph (a generalized form of graph). Our experimental results reveal that REMA
achieves superior performance on standard OOD generalization and test-time adaptation benchmarks.
In the future, we aim to extend this framework to more complex and dynamically changing scenes.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main claims in the abstract and introduction accurately represent the paper’s
contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide this part in the supplementary document.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All assumptions and definitions have been clearly stated.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

15


---Page Break---
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in
the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide
intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have fully disclosed all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: After internal review and patent approval, we will release the code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

16


---Page Break---
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided all the training and test details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the standard deviation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided these details in the supplementary.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.

17


---Page Break---
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have read the Code of Ethics and will always adhere to the principles it requires.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided this part in the supplementary.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly available datasets and code, and we have properly cited their papers or
project addresses.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

19


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
