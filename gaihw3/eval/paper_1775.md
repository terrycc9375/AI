Abstract

One of the main drawback of diffusion models is the slow inference time for image
generation. Among the most successful approaches to addressing this problem are
distillation methods. However, these methods require considerable computational
resources. In this paper, we take another approach to diffusion model acceleration.
We conduct a comprehensive study of the UNet encoder and empirically analyze
the encoder features. This provides insights regarding their changes during the
inference process. In particular, we find that encoder features change minimally,
whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations across different time-
steps. This insight motivates us to omit encoder computation at certain adjacent
time-steps and reuse encoder features of previous time-steps as input to the decoder
in multiple time-steps. Importantly, this allows us to perform decoder computation
in parallel, further accelerating the denoising process. Additionally, we introduce
a prior noise injection method to improve the texture details in the generated
image. Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our approach on

other tasks: text-to-video, personalized generation and reference-guided generation.
Without utilizing any knowledge distillation technique, our approach accelerates
both the Stable Diffusion (SD) and DeepFloyd-IF model sampling by 41% and
24% respectively, and DiT model sampling by 34%, while maintaining high-quality
generation performance.

Introduction

One of the popular paradigms in image generation, Diffusion Models (DMs) [1, 2, 3] have recently
achieved significant breakthroughs in various domains, including text-to-video generation [4, 5, 6],
personalized image generation [7, 8, 9] and reference-guided image generation [10, 11, 12]. While
diffusion models produce images of exceptional visual quality, their primary drawback lies in the
prolonged inference time. The original diffusion model had an inference time several orders of
magnitude slower than, for instance, GANs. One of the challenges hindering the acceleration of
diffusion models is their inherent sequential denoising process, which limits the possibilities of
effective parallelization.

To improve inference time speed of diffusion models, several methods have been developed, that
can roughly be divided in two sets of approaches. Firstly, involving step reduction, the aim is to
reduce the number of sampling steps within diffusion model inference, such as DDIM [13] and
DPM-Solver [14], which have significantly reduced the number of sampling steps. Secondly, in
contrast, knowledge distillation progressively distills a slow (many-step) teacher model into a faster
(few-step) student model [15, 16]. Some recent works [17, 18, 19] excel at generating high-fidelity
images in a few-step sampling scenario but face challenges in maintaining quality and diversity in
one-step sampling. The main drawback of the distillation methods is that they require retraining to
perform the distillation into faster diffusion models.

Figure 2: Visualising the hierarchical features 1. We
applied PCA to the hierarchical features following
PnP [20] and used the top three leading components
as an RGB image for visualization. The encoder fea-
tures change minimally and have similarities at many
time-steps (top), while the decoder features exhibit sub-
stantial variations across different time-steps (bottom).

Orthogonal to these methods, we take a
closer look at the sequential nature of the
denoising process. We focus on the char-
acteristics of the encoder in pretrained
diffusion models (e.g., the SD and the
DiT [21]2) Interestingly, based on our anal-
ysis presented in Sec 3.2, we discover
that encoder features change minimally
(Fig. 3a) and have a high degree of similar-
ity (Fig. 2 (top)), whereas the decoder fea-
tures exhibit substantial variations across
different time-steps (Fig. 3a and Fig. 2 (bot-
tom)). This insight is relevant because it
allows us to circumvent the computation of
the encoder during multiple time-steps. As a consequence, the decoder computations which are based
on the same encoder input can be performed in parallel. Instead, we reuse the computed encoder
features computed at one time-step (since these change minimally) as input to adjacent decoders
during the following time-steps. More recently, both DeepCache[22] and CacheMe[23] leverage
feature similarity to achieve acceleration. However, they rely on sequential denoising, as well as
CacheMe requires fine-tuning. Unlike these methods, our approach supports parallel processing,
which leads to faster inference (Tab. 2).

We show that the proposed propagation scheme accelerates the SD sampling by 24% , DeepFolyd-IF
sampling by 18%, and DiT sampling by 27%. Furthermore, since the same encoder features (from
previous time-steps) can be used as the input to the decoder of multiple later time-steps, this makes it
possible to conduct multiple time-steps decoding concurrently. This parallel procession accelerates
SD sampling by 41%, DeepFloyd-IF sampling by 24%, and DiT sampling by 34%. Furthermore,
to alleviate the deterioration of the generated quality, we introduce a prior noise injection strategy
to preserve the texture details in the generated images. With these contributions, our proposed
method achieves improved sampling efficiency while maintaining high image generation quality.

2We define the first several transformer blocks of DiT as the encoder, and the remaining ones of the transform
blocks as the decoder.

features, and then calculate their Frobenius norm. (c) The hierarchical features of the UNet encoder

Importantly, our method can be combined with several approaches existing to speed up DMs. The
main advantage of our method with respect to distillation-based approaches, is that our method can
be applied at inference time, and does not require retraining a new faster distillation model; a process
that is computationally very demanding and infeasible for actors with limited computational budget.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a wide range of conditional diffusion-
based tasks, including text-to-video generation (e.g., Text2Video-zero [4] and VideoFusion [5]),
personalized image generation (e.g., Dreambooth [7]) and reference-guided image generation (e.g.,
ControlNet [10]).

To summarize, we make the following contributions:

• We conduct a thorough empirical study of the features of the UNet in the diffusion model showing
that encoder features vary minimally (whereas decoder feature vary significantly).
• We propose a parallel strategy for diffusion model sampling at adjacent time-steps that significantly
accelerates the denoising process. Importantly, our method does not require any training or
fine-tuning technique.
• Furthermore, we also present a prior noise injection method to improve the image quality (mainly
improving the quality of high-frequency textures).
• Our method can be combined with existing methods (like DDIM, and DPM-solver) to further
accelerate diffusion model inference time.

Denoising diffusion model.
Recently, Text-to-image diffusion models [1, 24, 25, 26] have made
significant advancements. Notably, Stable Diffusion and DeepFloyd-IF stand out as two of the most
successful diffusion models available within the current open-source community. These models,
building upon the UNet architecture, are versatile and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including
image editing [27, 28], super-resolution [29, 30], segmentation [31, 32], and object detection [33, 34].
Given the strong scalability of transformer networks, DiT [21] investigates the transformer backbone
for diffusion models.
Diffusion model acceleration. Diffusion models use iterative denoising with UNet for image gener-
ation, which is time-consuming. There are plenty of works trying to address this issue. One strategy
involves employing efficient diffusion model solvers, such as DDIM [13] and DPM-Solver [14],
which have demonstrated notable reductions in sampling steps. Additionally, ToMe [35] exploits
token redundancy to minimize the computations necessary for attention operations [36]. Conversely,
knowledge distillation methods, exemplified by techniques like progressive simplification by student
models [15, 16], aim to streamline existing models. Some recent studies combine model compression
with distillation to achieve faster sampling [37, 38]. Orthogonal to these approaches, we introduce a
novel method for enhancing sampling efficiency in DMs inference. We show that our method can be
combined with several existing speed-up methods for further acceleration.
DeepCache[22] and CacheMe[23] are two recent works that leverage feature similarity to achieve
acceleration. DeepCache [22] adopts a strategy of rudely reusing features cached from the previous
step, requiring iterative denoising. Furthermore, CacheMe [23] requires additional fine-tuning for

Method
We first briefly revisit the architecture of the Stable Diffusion (SD) (Sec. 3.1), and then conduct a
comprehensive analysis for the hierarchical features of the UNet (Sec. 3.2). Our analysis shows that it
is possible to parallelize the diffusion model denoising process partially. Thus, we introduce a novel
method to accelerate the diffusion sampling while still largely maintaining the generation quality and
fidelity (Sec. 3.3).

3.1
Latent Diffusion Model
In the diffusion inference stage, the denoising network ϵθ takes as input a text embedding c, a
latent code zt and a time embedding, predicts noise, resulting in a latent zt−1 using the DDIM
scheduler [13]:

where αt is a predefined scalar function at time-step t (t = T, ..., 1). The typical denoising network
uses a UNet-based architecture. It consists of an encoder E, a bottleneck B, and a decoder D,
respectively (Fig. 4b). The hierarchical features extracted from the encoder E are injected into the
decoder D by a skip connection (Fig. 4a). For convenience of description, we divide the UNet network
into specific blocks: E = {E(·)s}, B = {B(·)8}, and D = {D(·)s}, where s ∈{8, 16, 32, 64} (see
Fig. 4b). Both E(·)s 3 and D(·)s represent the block layers with input resolution s in both encoder
and decoder, respectively.

Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [21] is a novel architecture for diffusion models. It replaces the UNet
backbone with a transformer, which consists of 28 blocks. Based on our observations, we define the
first 18 blocks as the encoder, and the remaining 10 blocks as the decoder (see Appendix A.3).

and the decoder D, for a deeper understanding of the different parts of the UNet. Note the following
observed properties also exist in DiT (see Appendix A.3).

Feature evolution across time-steps.
We experimentally observe that the encoder features exhibit
a subtle variation at adjacent time-steps, whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations
across different time-steps (see Fig. 3a and Fig. 2). Specifically, given a pretrained diffusion model,
we iteratively produce a latent code zt (see Eq. 1), and the corresponding hierarchical features:
{E(zt, c, t)s}, {B(zt, c, t)8}, and {D(zt, c, t)s} (s ∈{8, 16, 32, 64}) 4, as shown in Fig. 4b. Here,
we analyze how the hierarchical features change at adjacent time-steps. To achieve this goal, we
quantify the variation of the hierarchical features as follows:

∆E(·)s =
1
d×s2 ∥E(zt, c, t)s −E(zt−1, c, t −1)s∥2
2,
(2)

where d represents the number of channels in E(zt, c, t)s. Similarly, we also compute ∆B(·)8 and
∆D(·)s.

As illustrated in Fig. 3a, for both the encoder E and the decoder D, the curves exhibit a similar
trend: in the wake of an initial increase, the variation reaches a plateau and then decreases, followed
by a continuing growth towards the end. However, the extent of change in ∆E(·)s and ∆D(·)s is
quantitatively markedly different. For example, the maximum value and variance of the ∆E(·)s are
less than 0.4 and 0.05, respectively (Fig. 3a (zoom-in area)), while the corresponding values of the
∆D(·)s are about 5 and 30, respectively (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we find that ∆D(·)64, the change of
the last layer of the decoder, is close to zero. This is due to the output of the denoising network being
similar at adjacent time-steps [39]. In conclusion, the overall feature change ∆E(·)s is smaller than
∆D(·)s throughout the inference phase.

Feature evolution across layers.
We experimentally observe that the feature characteristics are
significantly different between the encoder and the decoder across all time-steps. For the encoder
E the intensity of the change is slight, whereas it is very drastic for the decoder D. Specifically we
calculate the Frobenius norm for hierarchical features E(zt, c, t)s across all time-steps, dubbed as
FE(·)s = {FE(zT ,c,T )s, ..., FE(z1,c,1)s}. Similarly, we compute FB(·)8 and FD(·)s, respectively.

Fig. 3b shows the feature evolution across layers with a boxplot 5. Specifically, for

FE(·)s
	
and

FB(·)8
	
, the box is relatively compact, with a narrow range between their first-quartile and third-
quartile values. For example, the maximum box height (FE(.)32) of these features is less than 5 (see
Fig. 3b (zoom-in area)). This indicates that the features from both the encoder E and the bottleneck
B slightly change. In contrast, the box heights corresponding to {D(·)s} are relatively large. For
example, for the D(.)64 the box height is over 150 between the first quartile and third quartile values
(see Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we also provide a standard deviation (Fig. 3c), which exhibits similar
phenomena to Fig. 3b. These results show that the encoder features have relatively small discrepancy
and a high degree of similarity across all layers. However, the decoder features evolve drastically.

Could we omit the Encoder at certain time-steps?
As indicated by the previous experimental
analysis, we observe that, during the denoising process, the decoder features change drastically,
whereas the encoder E features change minimally, and have a high degree of similarities at certain
adjacent time-steps. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4c, We propose to omit the encoder at certain
time-steps and use the same encoder features for several decoder steps. This allows us to compute
these multiple decoder steps in parallel.

Specifically, we delete the encoder at time-step t −1 (t −1 < T), and the corresponding decoder
(including the skip connections) takes as input the hierarchical outputs of the encoder E from the
previous time-step t, instead of the ones from the current time-step t−1 like the standard SD sampling
(for more detail, see Sec. 3.3).

When omitting the encoder at a certain time-step, we are able to generate similar images (Fig. 4c) like
standard SD sampling (Fig. 4a, Tab. 1 (the first and second rows) and additional results in Appendix F).
Alternatively, if we use a similar strategy for the decoder (i.e., decoder propagation), we find the

4The feature resolution is half of the previous one in the encoder and two times in the decoder. Note that the
feature resolutions of E(.)8, B(.)8 and D(.)64 do not change in the SD model.

percentile), the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) values of the feature

generated images often fail to cover some specific objects in the text prompt (Fig. 4d). For example,
when provided with prompt “A man with a beard wearing glasses and a beanie", the SD model fails
to synthesize “glasses" when applying decoder propagation. This is due to the fact that the semantics
are mainly contained in the features from the decoder rather than the encoder [40].

The encoder propagation, which uses encoder outputs from previous time-step as the input to the
current decoder, could speed up the diffusion model sampling at inference time. In the following
Sec. 3.3, we give further elaborate on encoder propagation.

3.3
Encoder propagation

Diffusion sampling, combining iterative denoising with transformers, is time-consuming. Therefore
we propose a novel and practical diffusion sampling acceleration method. During the diffusion
sampling process t= {T, ..., 1}, we refer to the time-steps where encoder propagation is deployed,
as non-key time-steps denoted as tnon-key=
n
tnon-key

N−1
o
. The remaining time-steps are

dubbed as tkey=
n
tkey
0
, tkey
1
, ..., tkey
T −1−N
o
. In other words, we do not use the encoder at time-steps

tnon-key, and leverage the hierarchical features of the encoder from the time-step tkey. Note we
utilize the encoder E at the initial time-step (tkey
0
= T). Thus, the diffusion inference time-steps could
be reformulated as

tkey, tnon-key	
, where tkey ∪tnon-key = {T, ..., 1} and tkey ∩tnon-key = ∅. In
the following, we introduce both uniform encoder propagation and non-uniform encoder propagation
strategies.

As shown in Fig. 3a, The encoder feature change is larger in the initial inference phase compared
to the later phases throughout the inference process. Therefore, we select more key time-steps in
the initial inference phase, and less key time-steps in later phases. We experimentally define the key
time-steps as tkey={50, 49, 48, 47, 45, 40, 35, 25, 15} for SD model with DDIM, and tkey={100, 99,
98, . . ., 92, 91, 90, 85, 80, . . ., 25, 20, 15, 14, 13, . . ., 2, 1}6, {50, 49, . . . , 2, 1} and {75, 73, 70,
66, 61, 55, 48, 40, 31, 21, 10} for three stage of DeepFloyd-IF (see detail key time-steps selection
in Appendix F.2). The remaining time-steps are categorized as non-key time-steps. We define this
strategy as non-uniform encoder propagation (see Fig. 4e). As shown in Fig. 4c, we also explore the
non-key time-step selection with fix stride (e.g, 2), dubbed as uniform encoder propagation.

Note that our method does not reduce the number of sampling steps. During encoder propagation,
the decoder computes for all time-steps, necessitating time embedding inputs for each time-step to
maintain temporal coherence (see detail in Appendix D).

Tab. 5 reports the results of the ablation study, considering various combinations of key and non-key
time-steps. These results indicate that the set of non-uniform key time-steps performs better in
generating images.

Figure 5: Comparing with SD (left), encoder prop-

Parallel non-uniform encoder propagation.
When applying the non-uniform encoder prop-
agation strategy, at time-step t ∈tnon−key the
decoder inputs do not rely on the encoder out-
puts at time-step t (see Fig. 4e). Instead, it relies
on the encoder output at the previous nearest
key time-step. This allows us to perform par-
allel non-uniform encoder propagation at these
adjacent time-steps in tnon−key. We perform de-
coding in parallel from t to t −k + 1 time-steps.
This technique further improves the inference
efficiency since the decoder forward in multiple time-steps could be conducted concurrently. We
indicate this as parallel-batch non-key time-steps. As shown in Fig. 5 (right), this further reduces
evaluation time by 41% for the SD model.

Prior noise injection.
Although the encoder propagation could improve the efficiency in the
inference phase, we observe that it leads to a slight loss of texture information in the generated
results (see Fig. 6 (left, middle)). Inspired by related works [41, 42], we propose a prior noise

injection strategy. It combines the initial latent code zT into the generative process at subsequent
time-step (i.e., zt), following zt = zt + α · zT , if t < τ, where α = 0.003 is the scale parameter
to control the impact of zT . And we start to use this injection mechanism from τ = 25 step. This
strategic incorporation successfully improves the texture information. Importantly, it demands almost
negligible extra computational resources. We observe that the loss of texture information occurs in all
frequencies of the frequency domain (see Fig. 6 (right, red, and blue curves)). This approach ensures
a close resemblance of generated results in the frequency domain to both SD and zT injection (see
Fig. 6 (right, red and green curves)), with the generated images maintaining the desired fidelity (see
Fig. 6 (left, bottom)).

Datasets and evaluation metrics.
We
randomly select 10K prompts from the
MS-COCO2017 validation dataset [43] and
feed them into the text-to-image diffusion
model to obtain 10K generated images.
For the transformer architecture diffusion
model, we randomly generate 50K images
from 1000 ImageNet [44] class labels. For
other tasks, we use the same settings as baselines (e.g., Text2Video-zero [4], VideoFusion [5], Dream-
booth [7] and ControlNet [10]). We use the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [45] metric to assess
the visual quality of the generated images, and the Clipscore [46] to measure the consistency between
image content and text prompt. Furthermore, we report the average values for both the computational
workload (GFLOPs/image) and sampling time (s/image) to represent the resource demands for a
single image. See more detailed implementation information on Appendix A.

We first evaluate the proposed encoder propaga-
tion method for the standard text-to-image gen-
eration task on both the latent space (i.e., SD)
and pixel space (i.e., DeepFloyd-IF) diffusion
models. As shown in Tab. 1, we significantly
accelerate the diffusion sampling with negligi-
ble performance degradation. Specifically, our
proposed method decreases the computational
burden (GFLOPs) by a large margin (27%) and
greatly reduces sampling time to 41% when
compared to standard DDIM sampling in SD.
Similarly, in DeepFloyd-IF, the reduction in both
computational burden and time reaches 15% and
24%, respectively. Furthermore, our method can
be combined with the latest sampling techniques
like DPM-Solver [14], DPM-Solver++ [47], and
ToMe [35]. Our method enhances sampling ef-
ficiency while preserving good model perfor-
mance, with negligible variations of both FID and Clipscore values (Tab. 1 (the third to eighth rows)).
Our method achieves good performance across different sampling steps (Fig. 7 and see Appendix D
for quantitative results.). Importantly, these results show that our method is orthogonal and compatible

with these acceleration techniques. As shown in Fig. 1, we visualize the generated images with
different sampling techniques. Our method still generates high-quality results (see Appendix F for
additional results).

Our method allows to use multi-GPU to generate one image. With multi-GPU parallel, our proposed
method further accelerates the SD sampling by 77%, whereas DeepCache [22] and CacheMe [23]
achieve speedups of 56% and 44%, respectively (See Tab. 2). These results indicate that we achieve
superior acceleration compared to DeepCache [22] and CacheMe [23].

4.2
Diffusion Transformer

We also evaluate our approach on DiT. As reported in Tab. 3, we achieve accelerations of about 29%
and 34% for DiT sampling with image resolution of 256 and 512, respectively, while preserving
high-quality results (see Figs. 1 and 18).

4.3
Other tasks with text-guided diffusion model

Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our proposed approach on other tasks:
text-to-video generation, personalized generation, and reference-guided image generation.

Text-to-video.
To evaluate our method, we combine it with both Text2Video-zero [4] and VideoFu-
sion [5]. As reported in Tab. 4 (the second and fourth rows), when combined with our method, the two
methods have a reduction of approximately 22% to 33% in both computational burden and generation
time. These results indicate that we are able to enhance the efficiency of generative processes in
the text-to-video task while preserving video fidelity at the same time (Fig. 1 (left, bottom)). As
an example, when generating a video using the prompt “Fireworks bloom in the night sky", the
VideoFusion model takes 17.92 seconds with 16 frames for the task (1.12s/frame), when combined
with our method it only takes 12.27s (0.76s/frame) to generate a high-quality video (Fig. 1 (left,
bottom)).
Personalized image generation.
Dreambooth [7] and Custom Diffusion [8] are two approaches for
customizing tasks by fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. As reported in Tab. 4 (the ninth
to twelfth rows), our method, combining with the two customization approaches, accelerates image

generation and reduces computational demands. Visually, it maintains the ability to generate images
with specific contextual relationships based on reference images. (Fig. 1 (right))
Reference-guided image generation. ControlNet [10] incorporates a trainable encoder, successfully
generates a text-guided image, and preserves similar content with conditional information. Our
approach can be applied concurrently to two encoders of ControNet. In this paper, we validate the
proposed method with two conditional controls: edge and scribble. Tab. 4 (the fifth to eighth row)
reports quantitative results. We observe that it leads to a significant decrease in both generation time
and computational burden. Furthermore, Fig. 1 (middle, bottom) qualitatively shows that our method
successfully preserves the given structure information and achieves similar results as ControlNet.
User study.
We conducted a user study, as depicted in Fig. 8, and asked subjects to select results.
We apply pairwise comparisons (forced choice) with 18 users (35 pairs of images or videos/user).
The results demonstrate that our method performs equally well as the baseline methods.

Figure 9: Generating image with uniform and non-
uniform encoder propagation. The result of uni-
form strategy II yields smooth and loses textual
compared with SD. Both uniform strategy III and
non-uniform strategy I, II and III generate images
with unnatural saturation levels.

We ablate the results with different selections
of both uniform and non-uniform encoder prop-
agation. Tab. 5 reports that the performance
of the non-uniform setting outperforms the uni-
form one in terms of both FID and Clipscore
(see Tab. 5 (the third and eighth rows)). Further-
more, we explore different configurations within
the non-uniform strategy. The strategy, using
the set of key time-steps we established, yields
better results in the generation process (Tab. 5
(the eighth row)). We further present qualita-
tive results stemming from the above choices.
As shown in Fig. 9, given the same number of
key time-steps, the appearance of nine-step non-
uniform strategy I, II and III settings do not
align with the prompt “Fireflies dot the night
sky". Although the generated image in the two-
step setting exhibits a pleasing visual quality,
its sampling efficiency is lower than our chosen
setting (see Tab. 5 (the second and eighth rows)).

As reported in Tab. 6, the differences in FID
and Clipscores without zT (the third column),
when compared to DDIM and Ours (the second
and fourth columns), are approximately 0.01%,
which can be considered negligible. While this
is not the case for the visual expression of the generated image, it is observed that the output
contains complete semantic information with smoothing texture (refer to Fig. 6 (left, the second row)).
Injecting the zT aids in maintaining fidelity in the generated results during encoding propagation (see
Fig. 6 (left, the third row) and Fig. 6 (right, red and green curves)).

Conclusion

In this work, We explore the characteristics of the encoder and decoder in UNet of the text-to-image
diffusion model and find that encoder feature variation is minimal for many time-steps, while the
decoder plays a significant role across all time-steps. Building upon this finding, we propose encoder
propagation for efficient diffusion sampling, reducing time on both the UNet-based and the transform-
based diffusion models on a diverse set of generation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments and
validate that our approach can achieve improved sampling efficiency while maintaining image quality.
Limitations: Although our approach achieves efficient diffusion sampling, it faces challenges in
generating quality when using a limited number of sampling steps (e.g., 5). In addition, even though
our proposed parallelization can also be applied to network distillation approaches [18, 17, 19], we
have not explored this direction in this paper and leave it to future research.

Appendix

In the appendix, we provide a detailed description of the experimental implementation (Appendix A).
Subsequently, an analysis of the parameter quantities for the encoder and decoder is conducted
(Appendix B).

Following that, we explain the methodology used to compute Clipscore (Appendix C), as well as
highlight the distinction between our approach and methods that reduce sampling steps (Appendix D).
Then, we present additional experiments and results, including more detailed ablation studies and
comparative experiments (Appendix F). In the end, we provide a statement of the potential broader
impact of our work (Appendix H).

A.1
Configure

We use the Stable Diffuison v1.5 pre-trained model 8 and DeepFloyd-IF 9. All of our inference
experiments are conducted using an A40 GPU (48GB of VRAM).

We randomly select 100 captions from the MS-COCO 2017 validation dataset [43] as prompts for
generating images. The analytical results presented in Sec. 3.2 are based on the statistical outcomes
derived from these 100 generated images.

A.2
Details about the layers in the UNet

The UNet in Stable Diffusion (SD) consists of an encoder E, a bottleneck B, and a decoder D,
respectively. We divide the UNet into specific blocks: E = {E(·)s}, B = {B(·)8}, and D = {D(·)s},
where s ∈{8, 16, 32, 64}. E(·)s and D(·)s represent the block layers with input resolution s in the
encoder and decoder, respectively. Tab. 7 presents detailed information about the block architecture.
Fig. 10 illustrates the hierarchical features for these blocks.

Figure 10: Visualising the hierarchical features. We applied PCA to the hierarchical features following
PnP [20] and used the top three leading components as an RGB image for visualization. The encoder
features changes minimally and has similarity at many time-steps (left), while the decoder features
exhibit substantial variations across different time-steps (right).

Figure 11: DiT feature statistics (F-norm)

Fig. 12 visualizes the hierarchical features for
DiT [21] blocks, which includes 28 transformer
blocks. Through visualization and statistical anal-
ysis (see Fig. 12 and Fig. 11), we observe that the
features in the first several transformer blocks change
minimally (i.e., the first 18 blocks), similar to the
Encoder in SD, while the features in the remaining
transformer blocks exhibit substantial variations (i.e.,
the remaining 10 blocks), akin to the Decoder in SD.
For ease of presentation, we refer to the first sev-
eral transformer blocks of DiT as the Encoder and
the remaining transformer blocks as the Decoder. In
Tab. 3, we demonstrate the accelerating performance
of our method while applied to DiT-based generation
models.

A.4
Time and memory consumption ratios

We report the run time and GPU memory consumption ratios for text-to-image task. As shown in
Tab. 8, we significantly accelerate the diffusion sampling with encoder propagation while maintaining
a comparable memory demand to the baselines (Tab. 8 (the last two columns)). Specifically, our
proposed method reduces the spending time (s/image) by 24% and requires a little additional memory
compared to standard DDIM sampling in SD (DDIM vs. Ours: 2.62GB vs. 2.64GB). The increased
GPU memory requirement is for caching the features of the encoder from the previous time-step.
Though applying parallel encoder propagation results in an increase in memory requirements by
51%, it leads to a more remarkable acceleration of 41% (DDIM vs. Ours: 2.62GB vs. 3.95GB). In
conclusion, applying encoder propagation reduces the sampling time, accompanied by a negligible
increase in memory requirements. Parallel encoder propagation on text-to-image tasks yields a
sampling speed improvement of 20% to 43%, requiring an additional acceptable amount of memory.

Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our proposed approach on other tasks:
text-to-video generation (i.e., Text2Video-zero [4] and VideoFusion [5]), personalized generation
(i.e., Dreambooth [7] and Custom Diffusion [8]) and reference-guided image generation (i.e., Con-
trolNet [10]). We present the time and memory consumption ratios for these tasks in Tab. 9.

As reported in Tab. 9 (top), when combined with our method, there is a reduction in sampling time
by 23% and 32% for Text2Video-zero [4] and VideoFusion [5], respectively, while the memory
requirements increased slightly by 3% (0.2GB) and 0.9% (0.11GB).

The time spent by reference-guided image generation (i.e., ControlNet [10]) is reduced by more
than 20% with a negligible increase in memory (1%). When integrated with our parallel encoder
propagation, the sampling time in this task can be reduced by more than half (51%) (Tab. 9 (middle)).
Dreambooth [7] and Custom Diffusion [8] are two approaches for customizing tasks by fine-tuning
text-to-image diffusion models. As reported in Tab. 9 (bottom), our method, working in conjunction
with the two customization approaches, accelerates the image generation with an acceptable increase
in memory.

conducted GPU memory consumption ratios using the official method provided by PyTorch,
torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated 10 , which records the peak allocated memory since the
start of the program.

A.5
GFLOPs

We use the fvcore11 library to calculate the GFLOPs required for a single forward pass of the diffusion
model. Multiplying this by the number of sampling steps gives us the total computational burden for
sampling one image. Additionally, using fvcore, we can determine the computational load required
for each layer of the diffusion model. Based on the key time-steps set in our experiments, we
subtract the computation we save from the original total computational load, which then represents
the GFLOPs required by our method. Similarly, fvcore also supports parameter count statistics.

A.6
Baseline Implementations

For the comparisons of text-to-image generation in Sec. 4, we use the official implementation of
DPM-Solver [14], DPM-Solver++ [47] 12, and ToMe [35] 13. For the other tasks with text-guided
diffusion model, we use the official implementation of Text2Video-zero [4] 14, VideoFusion [5] 15,
ControlNet [10] 16, Dreamboth [7] 17, and Custom Diffusion [8] 18. We maintain the original
implementations of these baselines and directly integrate code into their existing implementations to
implement our method.

Parameter Count and FLOPs of SD

We take into account model complexity in terms of parameter count and FLOPs (see Tab. 10). It’s
noteworthy that the decoder D exhibits a significantly greater parameter count, totaling 0.51 billion.
This figure is approximately 1.47 times the number of parameter combinations for the encoder E (250
million) and the bottleneck B (97 million). This substantial parameter discrepancy suggests that the
decoder D carries a more substantial load in terms of model complexity.

Furthermore, when we consider the computational load, during a single forward inference pass of
the SD model, the decoder D incurs a considerable 504.4 million FLOPs. This value is notably
higher, approximately 2.2 times, than the cumulative computational load of the encoder E, which
amounts to 224.2 million FLOPs, and the bottleneck B, which requires 6.04 million FLOPs. This
observation strongly implies that the decoder D plays a relatively more important role in processing
and transforming the data within the UNet architecture, emphasizing its critical part in the overall
functionality of the model.

C
The methodology for computing Clipscore

Clipscore [46] is a metric for computing the consistency between text and image. The formula for
computing Clip-score between image embedding v and text embedding c, as presented in the original
paper, is as follows:
CLIP-S = w ∗max(cos(c, v), 0),

where a re-scaling operation is performed using w, set to 2.5 in the official implementation of
Clipscore [46]. The rationale behind the re-scaling operation, as provided by the official paper
(excerpted from [46], Section 3, Footnote 6), is as follows:

While the cosine similarity, in theory, can range from [−1, 1] (1) we never observed a negative
cosine similarity; and (2) we generally observe values ranging from roughly zero to roughly
.4. The particular value of w we advocate for, w = 2.5, attempts to stretch the range of the
score distribution to [0, 1].

Therefore, adhering to the aforementioned setting, we employed the official implementation of
Clipscore for evaluation, yielding Clipscore data distributed around 0.75. Some works [8, 48] employ
re-scaling operations during evaluation, yielding Clipscore values around 0.75, while others [10, 4]
do not, resulting in Clipscore values around 0.3. In essence, both approaches are equivalent, differing
only in whether re-scaling is applied at the end. We evaluate Clipscore using w = 2.5 for re-scaling,
hence yielding Clipscore data around 0.75, unless otherwise stated.

D
Different from step-reduction methods

Several efficient diffusion model solvers, such as DDIM [13], DPM-Solver [14] and DPM-
Slover++ [47], have significantly reduced sampling steps. Our method does not reduce the number of
sampling steps. In the encoder propagation, the decoder needs to compute for all time-steps, and we
require time embedding inputs for all time-steps to maintain temporal coherence.

Fig. 13 illustrates the qualitative comparison results of SD (DDIM) showcasing a reduction in steps
(i.e., 9 and 25 time-steps). We present the results with 9 steps because the number of key time-steps
for the SD model with DDIM in our approach is 9. The generation quality notably declines with step
reduction, attributed to alterations in image structure and a diminished attention to detail generation,

as exemplified by the hands in Fig. 13 (the second cloumn). We increase the number of sampling
steps (i.e., 25 steps), and find that the sampling results do not perform as well as DDIM with 50
steps and its variation with FasterDiffusion (Fig. 13 and Tab. 11). As shown in Tab. 11, the FID
and Clipscore of SD (DDIM) with 25 time-steps on the MS-COCO 2017 10K subset are 22.16 and
0.761, respectively, significantly worse than the results obtained with 50 time-steps and ours (FID↓:
21.75, 21.08; Clipscore↑: 0.773, 0.783). This demonstrates that our method is not simply reducing
the number of sampling steps. With fewer steps (T=10), both DPM-Solver and DPM-Solver++ also

21


---Page Break---
exhibit worse FID and Clipscore (see Tab. 12). These results indicate that our method achieves better
performance compared to simply reducing the sampling steps.

As shown on Tab. 11, we conduct DDIM scheduler inference time with various steps. Although
FasterDiffusion (the last row) is slightly longer than DDIM scheduler with 9 steps, our sampling
results are much closer the 50-step DDIM generation quality, whereas the 9-step DDIM results are
much inferior (see Tab. 11, Tab. 12, and Fig. 13 for examples).

For directly applying noise injection to the generation phase, we show image generation examples
in Fig. 14 in the rebuttal file. Fewer sampling steps equipped with prior noise injection result in
almost no improvement in image quality. Tab. 11 further supports this conclusion. While in our case,
FasterDiffusion working without the noise injection will lead to smoother textures, as shown in Fig.6.
The noise injection technique helps in preserving fidelity in the generated results.

E
Difference between “prior noise injection” and “churn”

In EDM [49] (Karras et al.), they increase the noise level during ODE sampling to improve determin-
istic sampling, which is referred to as stochastic sampling (i.e., “churn”). Compared to deterministic
sampling, it injects noise into the image at each step, which helps to enhance the quality of the
generated images. Song et al. [50] first observed that perturbing data with random Gaussian noise
makes the data distribution more amenable to score-based generative modeling. Increasing the noise
level in EDM is based on Song’s paper.

Their purpose for injecting noise is to perturb the data, whereas our purpose for injecting noise during
sampling is to preserve high-frequency details in the image during the denoising process, preventing
the diffusion model from removing high-frequency information as noise (see Figure.6 in the main
paper). In addition, our method FasterDiffusion differs from them by only inserting noise in the later
stage of the diffusion steps, while they insert noise to all time-steps.

F
Ablation Experiments and Additional Results

F.1
Comparion with DeepCache

DeepCache is developed based on the observation over the temporal consistency between high-level
features. In this paper, we have a more thorough analytical study over the SD model features as
shown in Fig.3, where we find out the encoder features change less, whereas the decoder features
exhibit substantial variations across different time steps. This insight motivates us to omit encoder
computation at certain adjacent time-steps and reuse encoder features of previous time-steps as input
to the decoder in multiple time-steps. We further determine the key time steps in the T2I inference
stage, which helps our method to skip the time steps in a more scientific way.

It is also important to note that DeepCache is not parallelizable on multiple GPUs since DeepCache
needs to use all or part of the encoder and decoder at every time step. FasterDiffusion, on the other
hand, only uses the encoder at the key time steps, which enables parallel processing at these time
steps and faster inference time cost.

It is also worth to notice that FasterDiffusion can be further combined with a wide range of diffusion
model based tasks, including Text2Video-zero, VideoFusion, Dreambooth, and ControlNet. In this
case, DeepCache often shows much slower speed while applied to these tasks. As an example
shown in Table. 13, when combined with ControlNet DeepCache is slower by 24% compared to the
FasterDiffusion.

More specifically, since the ControlNet model requires an additional encoder, our method Faster-
Diffusion is able to execute this extra encoder in a parallel manner and reuse it, and that makes the
additional time negligible. On the other hand, DeepCache is reusing the decoder feature, which
leads the ControlNet to wait for the additional encoder to complete computation at each time-step,
resulting in almost no time saved from skipping the encoder in the standard SD models. The T2I
generation results are shown in Figure. 15, FasterDiffusion successfully preserves the given structure
information and achieves similar results as the original ControlNet model.

F.2
The definition of key time-steps in various tasks

We utilize 50, 20 and 20 time-steps for DDIM scheduler [13], DPM-solver [14] and DPM-
solver++ [47], respectively. We follow the official implementation of DeepFloyd-IF, setting the
time-steps for the three sampling stages to 100, 50, and 75, respectively.

Text-to-image generation. We experimentally define the key time-steps as tkey = {50, 49, 48, 47,
45, 40, 35, 25, 15} for SD model with DDIM [13], and tkey = {100, 99, 98, . . ., 92, 91, 90, 85,
80, . . ., 25, 20, 15, 14, 13, . . ., 2, 1}, {50, 49, . . . , 2, 1} and {75, 73, 70, 66, 61, 55, 48, 40, 31,
21, 10} for three stages of DeepFloyd-IF with DDPM [2]. For SD with both DPM-Solver [14] and
DPM-Solver++ [47], we experimentally set the key time-steps to tkey = {20, 19, 18, 17, 15, 10, 5}.

Other tasks with text-guided diffusion model. In addition to standard text-to-image tasks, we
further validate our approach on other tasks with text-guided diffusion model (Sec. 4.2). These
tasks are all based on the SD implementation of DDIM [13]. Through experiments, we set the key
time-steps to tkey = {50, 49, 48, 47, 45, 40, 35, 25, 15} for Text2Video-zero [4], VideoFusion [5],
and ControlNet [10]. For personalized tasks (i.e., Dreambooth [7] and Custom Diffusion [8]), we set
the key time steps to tkey = {50, 49, 48, 47, 45, 40, 35, 25, 15, 10}.

F.3
The effectiveness of encoder propagation

In Sec. 3.2, we have demonstrated that encoder propagation (Fig. 16c) can preserve semantic
consistency with standard SD sampling (Fig. 16a). However, images generated through decoder
propagation often fail to match certain specific objects mentioned in the text prompt (Fig. 16d and
Tab. 14 (the third row)).

We extended this strategy to include encoder and decoder propagation (Fig. 16e) as well as decoder
and encoder dropping (Fig. 16f). Similarly, encoder and decoder propagation often fail to cover
specific objects mentioned in the text prompt, leading to a degradation in the quality of the generated
results (Fig. 16e and Tab. 14 (the fourth row)). On the other hand, decoder and encoder dropping are
unable to completely denoise, resulting in the generation of images with noise (Fig. 16f and Tab. 14
(the fifth row)). Note that decoder and encoder dropping (Fig. 16f) is different from directly reducing
the number of time-steps. Time embedding is required as input for each time-step, even when using
only the encoder or decoder at each time-step.

Users were required to select the image where the target was more accurately portrayed, or choose
“both equally good”. A total of 18 users participated the questionnaire, resulting in totally 630 samples
(35 questions × 1 option × 18 users). As the final results shown in Fig.8, the chosen percentages for
SD, DeepFloyd-IF, DPM-Solver++, Text-to-Video, ControlNet, and Personalize were 48%, 44%,
51%, 52%, 46%, and 39%, respectively. These results show that our method performs on par with
the baseline methods and demonstrate that FasterDiffusion retains the T2I generation quality while
reducing the inference time.

model are illustrated in Figs. 22, 23 and 24.

F.7
Additional tasks

ReVersion [53] is a relation inversion method that relies on the Stable Diffusion (SD). Our method
retains the capacity to generate images with specific relations based on exemplar images, as illustrated
in Fig. 25 (top).

P2P [27] is an image editing method guided solely by text. When combined with our approach, it
enhances sampling efficiency while preserving the editing effect (Fig. 25 (bottom)).

G
Automatic selection for key time steps

To identify key time steps, we conducted empirical analysis of feature changes at adjacent time steps in
multistep Stable Diffusion models (50-step model as an example). This analysis is based on statistics
from the distribution of features across 100 random prompts, which does not impose a high time cost.
We found that the encoder features change minimally in later time steps, whereas the encoder features
in earlier time steps exhibit substantial variations compared to later ones. Based on analysis as shown
in Section 3.2, we determine the key time-step as tkey = {50, 49, 48, 47, 45, 40, 35, 25, 15} for the
50-step Stable Diffusion model. As a general case, we also applied this key time-step configuration to
the ControlNet [10], Text2Video-zero [4], VideoFusion [5], Dreambooth [7] and Custom Diffusion [8]
models based on the 50-step SD models. That will not impose any additional searching time for the
key time steps for these downstream application scenarios.

Existing methods such as OMS-DPM [54], AutoDiffusion [55], and DDSM [56] utilize reinforcement
learning or machine learning algorithms to search for optimal schedules, time steps, and model sizes.
Each search iteration involves frequent image generation and FID calculations. Executing these
search algorithms is time-consuming, often exceeding the training time, as noted in DDSM. For
instance, the NSGA-II search algorithm used in DDSM incurs a search cost approximately 1.1 to 1.2
times that of training a standard diffusion model. We plan to incorporate the NSGA-II algorithm for
automatically searching tkey time steps as an enhancement to FasterDiffusion in our future research.

H
Impact Statements

Diffusion models generate realistic fake images, which assist individuals in their creative endeavors.
However, for those lacking the ability to discern whether the images are generated by a model, it may
affect their judgment.

Equipped with our technique, using DMs on the edge devices becomes feasible. Also, importantly,
our proposed acceleration of DMs does not require access to enormous compute, which is required to
the methods based on knowledge distillation [18, 17, 19]. This makes our technique also useful for
the many smaller actors in the generative AI field.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Abstract and Introduction (Section 1).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

33


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 and Appendix A. We will release our code to the public.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

34


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will provide our code in supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 for the experimental setting.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Figure 3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Tables 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix H.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite papers that we used in Section 4. The models, datasets, and codes
used in the paper are introduced in detail in Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide our source code as an anonymized zip file in the supplemental
material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See User Study in Section 4.3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
