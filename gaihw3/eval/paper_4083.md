Abstract

Releasing open-source large language models (LLMs) presents a dual-use risk
since bad actors can easily fine-tune these models for harmful purposes. Even
without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make
closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety
measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important,
such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose
Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that operates even when
attackers have access to the weights. RepNoise works by removing information
about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during fine-
tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets
of harm that have not been seen during the defence process as long as they are
drawn from the same distribution of the attack set. Our method does not degrade
the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless
tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the efficacy of our defence lies in its
“depth”: the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed
across all layers of the LLM. We also find areas where RepNoise still remains
ineffective and highlight how those limitations can inform future research.

Introduction

Despite the benefits to both research and commercial development, open-sourcing large language
models (LLMs) poses several risks [12] such as facilitating the development of weapons [21]. Such
risks are not isolated to only open-source models, weights of proprietary models expose fine-tuning
APIs [49] which can be used for constructing harmful models and for reconstructing weights at
inference time [10]. The risk of LLMs assisting in harmful tasks is exacerbated by their increasing
ability to follow instructions, carry out sophisticated tasks, and the ease with which they can be
trained and run. Developers attempt to mitigate these risks [55] by developing safety guardrails that
prevent LLMs from performing harmful tasks at inference time. However, these guardrails are easily
circumvented either through back doors [33], adversarial attacks [45], or harmful fine-tuning [51].
We argue that no matter how sophisticated safety guardrails become, models vulnerable to harmful
fine-tuning and amenable to malicious modifications are fundamentally unsafe.

We propose Representation Noising (RepNoise) as the first defence to mitigate in-distribution harmful
fine-tuning attacks (HFAs) for LLMs in the natural language generation setting where the defender has
no control of the model after the attacker attains its weights. Our work is inspired by the observation

Figure 1: Representation Noising pushes the intermediate activations of harmful text inputs (their representations)
towards random directions, effectively reducing the mutual information between harmful representations and
harmful text sequences and making it difficult to recover harmful representations through HFAs. We visualize
this here as a projection (PCA) which isn’t able to recover any structure.

that safety mechanisms in LLMs are concentrated in a small proportion of the model weights
(identified through ablation studies in [64]) and displace rather than replace harmful capabilities
(identified by probing studies in [35, 38]); despite showing safe behaviour at inference-time, harmful
behaviour can be easily recovered [51]. RepNoise works by removing the information structure
of harmful representations such that they are much harder to recover during subsequent HFAs
(fig. 1). We refer readers to appendix A.1 for precise definitions of representations, information in
representations, and removing information.

Our contributions are as follows:

(a) We provide a defence method derived from an understanding of training dynamics that would
make harmful representations harder to recover (§ 3).
(b) We present extensive experimental evidence that our method can mitigate training on harmful
question-answering and toxic content generation tasks while maintaining the ability to train the
model on harmless tasks and preserving LLM capability (§ 4).
(c) We empirically investigate “how” our method works and show that it does indeed remove
information about harmful representations across all layers in the LLM (§ 5).

Harmful Fine-tuning and Defence Criteria

Harmful fine-tuning vulnerabilities in LLMs are established in several works [40, 51, 66, 67]. To
formalize the problem, we borrow from Rosati et al.’s [53] harmful fine-tuning attack threat model.

Harmful Fine-tuning Attack (HFA):
Suppose an attacker has access to a set of model weights for
a safety-aligned model—such as llama2-7b-chat [60]—which should refuse the attacker’s harmful
requests. Let Mθ[t=0] indicate a model M with the parameters θ, where t indicates the training steps
taken during the HFA. The initial unattacked model is indexed at t = 0. The attacker utilizes some
harmful dataset Dharmful to train a LLM to be harmful (i.e. minimize language modeling loss on this
dataset). The defender considers this behaviour unacceptable and does not want their model to be
able to be trained towards this end. Dharmful consists of prompts X = {Xi}n
i=1 and target responses
Y = {Yi}n
i=1. Using the harmful dataset, a malicious actor attempts to find parameters at training
step t∗that minimizes eq. (1), resulting in a model that is able to behave in a way designated harmful
by the defender:

θ[t∗] = arg min
θ[t] E(X,Y )∼Dharmful[L(Mθ[t](X), Y )],
(1)

where the loss L(Mθ(X), Y ) is a typical causal language modeling loss.

Harmful Fine-tuning Success: A HFA is formally designated a success if it causes the subject
model to exceed a chosen threshold ϕ set by the defender on a given safety metric g(·) : g(Mθ) > ϕ.

2


---Page Break---
Examples of safety metrics include Attack Success Rate [45, ASR] and probability outputs from the
Jigsaw Perspective API [39]. In this formalism, a viable defence is one in which the attacker will have
to spend more training steps t to achieve g(Mθ) > ϕ than they can afford in time and/or compute.

Immunization Conditions
To defend against HFAs, Rosati et al. [53] provides four conditions
for a successful defence, called Immunization Conditions (IC). We introduce them below in order to
motivate our search for a method that fulfills them theoretically and experimentally.

(IC1) Resistance: To increase the required effort for the attacker, a defended model M ∗
θ should
maximize the minimum number of training steps needed to produce a successful fine-tuning
attack, i.e. maxθ t(θ) such that g(M ∗
θ[t], Dharmful) > ϕ
(IC2) Stability: A defended model should preserve helpful (or harmless) behaviour of the undefended
model. We model this using a reference dataset or task Dref where we want the defended model
M ∗
θ to perform approximately the same on some task measured by a task capability metric
f(·), i.e. f(Mθ[t=0], Dref) ≈f(M ∗
θ[t=0], Dref). For example this could be ROUGE-1.
(IC3) Generalization: A defence should work against HFAs using samples not seen during the defence
process. Given disjoint subsets Dharm, D′
harm ⊂Dharmful the defence procedure producing M ∗
θ
based only on Dharm should be resistant to HFAs using D′
harm.
(IC4) Trainability: To retain the adaptability of the defended model, it should be trainable on harmless
datasets with similar efficiency and effectiveness as the undefended model i.e.

min
θ
f(M ∗
θ[t1], Dharmless) ≈min
θ
f(Mθ[t2], Dharmless);
|t1 −t2| ≤ϵ,

where t1 and t2 are the training steps for training the defended and undefended model equal
within some small tolerance ϵ and f(·) is the same as in Stability.

A model that fulfills these conditions is said to be “immunized.” § 4 provides an operationalization of
these conditions. Below, we provide the a defence that fulfills all these conditions.

3
Method

We propose Representation Noising, a method which fulfills the Immunization Criteria by reducing the
mutual information between intermediate activations of harmful text sequences (their representations)
and harmful text inputs before the attacker gains access and performs an HFA. Recall that after the
attacker has access, the defender cannot intervene. There is evidence that current safety methods
only suppress or route around preserved harmful representations [35, 38, 64]. This allows harmful
behaviour to be easily recovered through HFAs. RepNoise instead aims to remove information about
harmful tasks from intermediate activations over harmful text sequences, to make it difficult for the
model to relearn such information in future. The formal definition of information removal removal is
based on mutual information between intermediate activations and generative outputs based on those
activations and is specified in appendix A.1 which we encourage review before proceeding. RepNoise
consists of a three-part loss: (i) reduce the predictive information in the weights for generating
harmful outputs, (ii) retain capabilities by minimizing loss on harmless inputs, and (iii) push harmful
representations towards random noise to remove harmful information. Fig. 1 presents a high-level
intuition of our method.

Transition Probabilities and Adversarial Loss
Our goal is to derive a loss function which
will minimize the likelihood of recovering the mutual information I(Zharmful; Yharmful) which is
a quantity that measures how effective intermediate activations (or representations) Zharmful of
harmful input sequences Xharmful are at predicting the output token distribution Yharmful. We
are motivated by the observation in [1] that the number of training steps taken to fine-tune a model
trained on one source task to another target task minimized by Mθ[t∗] can be modeled as a transition
probability over paths (or training trajectories) in a loss landscape. Formally in the language modeling
case, a task here is a token output distribution over some dataset D. The source task is our initial
pre-training distribution and the target task is the generative distribution of harmful text tokens in
Dharmful. The loss landscape is the space (R|θ|) of the value of a loss function LD at every value of θ.
Paths or training trajectories in this landscape are the sequence of parameter configurations θi during
a training procedure for the iterates i.

From [1], the transition probability is p(θt∗, t∗| θt=0, t = 0) =
R t∗

0 p(θt | θt=0, t = 0) dθt. In other
words, the probability of reaching Mθ[t∗] at any given time step t is the accumulation of individual
transition probabilities over all paths reaching θt∗starting at t = 0. We can model the transition
probability with two components: a static distance, which depends on the distance of the loss
functions between the initial model θt=0 and the target model θt∗that minimizes LD, and a dynamic
reachability term that depends on the magnitude of the gradients of the loss function with respect to
parameters θt and determines the number of paths during a training procedure that contain both θt=0
and θt∗in the path sequence as defined above. To clarify, reachability is computed starting over all
initial weight configurations, the outer integral
R θt∗
θt=0 and the paths starting from these initial weights

that end in the optimal θt∗, the inner integral
R t∗

0 , so that the probability is

(2)

Note that this is a simplified approximation of Achille et al. [1]; see appendix A for details. As the
defender, we are only able to influence the initial set of weights θt=0. Therefore our goal is to find a
way to modify the model weights so that we minimize eq. (2). Where we have:
Theorem 1. Consider a set of initial weights θt=0 as well as weights θt∗that minimize a loss function
LD over the dataset D. The θt=0 that minimize the transition probability p(θt∗, t∗| θt=0, t = 0) are
given by the weights θt=0 that minimize the mutual information I(X; Zθ) between the inputs to a
neural network X drawn from D and the intermediate activations of that neural network Zθ used to
represent those inputs given the model weights θ. For which we have the minimizer argmin
θ
I(X; Zθ).

A full proof of this is given in appendix A. Based on information bottleneck theory [59], we view
multiple-layer neural networks as consisting of an encoder which maps the inputs X to representations
Z and a decoder which maps the learned Z to outputs Y . From Wang et al. [63] theorem 2, we
can minimize the mutual information I(Z; Y ) directly by performing gradient ascent (ℓascent), which
would decrease both the static distance and the reachability condition eq. (2) (see appendix A).

ℓascent = E(Xharmful,Yharmful)∼DharmfulL(Mθ(Xharmful), Yharmful).
(3)

However, gradient ascent over harmful samples can degrade overall language modeling capabilities,
so we add a term to ensure that performance over harmless samples is not degraded. In view of the
immunization conditions in Section 2, this ensures stability. Combining them, we get an adversarial
loss function:
LAdversarial = ℓstability −β · ℓascent,
(4)

where α is a regularization term, and ℓstability = E(X,Y )∼DharmlessL(Mθ(X), Y ).

Representation Noising
As we see later (Section 5), simply minimizing adversarial loss does not
effectively remove the ability to predict harmful text sequences from the activations over harmful text
sequences. This is because despite having low mutual information I(Y ; Z), the mutual information
between the inputs and the encoder layers I(Z; X) can still be high. Consequently, it is possible for
representations to retain the ability to generate harmful token sequences.

The data processing inequality [65], I(Y ; X) ≤I(Z; X) implies that minimizing I(X; Z) minimizes
I(X; Y ). We can do this by minimizing the KL divergence between the distribution of harmful
representations given harmful input token sequences Pθ[t=0](Z | X) and Gaussian noise N(0, I):
if these two distributions were the same then Z would have no information about X [65]. This
yields the noise loss ℓnoise = KL(p(Z | X) || N(0, I)). Combining this with eq. (4) using another
regularization term β, we get the loss function for Representation Noising (RepNoise) which satisfies
Theorem 1.
LRepNoise = LAdversarial + α · ℓnoise = ℓstability + α · ℓnoise −β · ℓascent.
(5)

We use a layer-wise approach to minimize LRepNoise, with multi-kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD) as a replacement for KL divergence that allows us to estimate the distribution of harmful
representations. Full implementation details are in appendix B.1.

Experiments

We perform a series of experiments to evaluate how our defence meets the four immunization
criteria in Section 2: we compare RepNoise with existing defence mechanisms in their ability to
make llama-2-7b-chat resistant to HFAs § 4.1 as well as evaluate RepNoise on Stability § 4.2,
Trainability § 4.3, and Generalization § 4.4.

4.1
Resistance

Here we simulate an HFA on llama-2-7b-chat and measure the harmfulness of the models and
a series of controls before and after these attacks. Appendix K reports similar experiments on
llama-2-13b-chat and the safety-trained Qwen (0.5B to 7B) series of models. We perform HFAs in
two domains: harmful question-answering and toxic content generation2. We measure attack strength
in terms of the learning rate and number of samples used during supervised fine-tuning. Full details
on our attack settings including rationale on learning rate choice can be found in appendix C.

To fine-tune for harmful question-answering, we use the BeaverTails harmful QA dataset [36] since it
is a very large-scale dataset used in other attack literature [32], where the goal is to train an LLM to
generate compliant answers to questions belonging to 14 categories of harm such as animal abuse
and violent crime. For harmfulness evaluation, we use the logits of the harmful label after passing a
question-answer pair into the harmfulness classifier trained on the BeaverTails dataset. The scores
are computed as the mean of each individual logit score, for more details on how the classifier was
trained as well as the scores is computed see appendix D.1.1. For toxic content generation, we use
the DecodingTrust [62] split of Real Toxicity Prompts (RTP) [19] to fine-tune an LLM to generate
highly toxic continuations. We perform toxicity evaluation using the mean toxicity scores from the
Perspective API [39] (appendix D).

We compare RepNoise with several safety interventions and controls: the original model, a randomly
initialised model (using Kaiming initialization [22]), additional safety training, gradient ascent,
adversarial loss, and Security Vectors [70]. A randomly initialized model allows us to measure
how quickly we converge to generating harmful tokens from random initial conditions (training a
model from scratch). Additional safety training is done by supervised fine-tuning the model on
refusals to answer 10k unsafe harmful question-answering samples from BeaverTails. Gradient ascent
uses the loss function in eq. (3), (appendix J shows layer-wise implementation results) for defence.
Adversarial loss minimizes eq. (4), and RepNoise minimizes eq. (1). Finally, we implement Security
Vectors, a defence where the defender does have control over the fine-tuning process. We train a
LoRA adapter on our harmful dataset and use the frozen adapter during the HFA (appendix F).

Table 1 shows results for the harmful QA task. HFAs without any defence mechanism substantially
increase the harmfulness score (Base) on the base model. Attacks with higher learning rates and
more data tend to be stronger. This replicates previous results about the effectiveness of HFAs at

2We experimented with malicious code generation tasks [9] but observed base models did not guard against
malicious code generation to begin with which is a pre-condition of performing our defence.

---Page Break---
circumventing safety training in LLMs [8, 40, 49, 51, 66]. Evaluating our defence mechanisms,
Security Vectors provides some resistance but RepNoise is the only defence method to consistently
able to provide significant resistance across all attacks (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.001).3

Gradient ascent and adversarial loss offer some resistance for weak attacks, but they fail for stronger
attacks. We hypothesize that harmful text generation is recovered quickly with these approaches
because they leave the representation structure of harmful text sequeces intact (see § 5). Randomly
initializing an LLM is not a useful control for understanding HFAs, since simply fine-tuning with
larger samples makes the model mimic harmful text from the dataset. Finally, additional safety
training offers no resistance, indicating that some types of traditional safety methods (safety-oriented
supervised fine-tuning) does not help to defend against HFAs.

Table 2 presents similar results for the toxic content generation task. In this case, there are 351 attack
samples, so we vary attack strength across learning rates only, performing all HFAs for 4 epochs. In
each setting, using a model immunized with RepNoise results in complete resistance.

Stability

To evaluate if RepNoise causes a deterioration in unrelated harmless tasks compared to the base model,
we use standard LLM benchmarks from the Eleuther AI LM Evaluation Harness [18]: TruthfulQA
[41], MMLU [26], Hellaswag [69], and ARC-easy [13]. We also evaluate changes in the model’s
capabilities on domains related to harmfulness using the Ethics [25] and CrowS-Pairs [48] datasets.

Table 3: Evaluation of RepNoise on common language model capability benchmarks.

Table 3 shows that a llama2-7b-chat model immunized using RepNoise achieves similar scores as
the base model across all evaluations, indicating that RepNoise does not degrade capability. Beyond
performance evaluations, our method does not degrade performance on other safety benchmarks, i.e.
Ethics, or CrowS-Pairs. We perform further investigations on whether RepNoise has any effect on
fairness (appendix E.4), exaggerated safety (appendix E.5), or adversarial robustness (appendix E.6)—
with the general finding that RepNoise neither degrades nor improves inference-time safety over a
baseline safety-guarded model which implies that RepNoise would supplement rather than replace
other defence methods.

4.3
Trainability

Recall that Trainability is the defence condition from above that states that after applying defences
models should still be able to be trained effectively on harmless datasets. The reason for this is that
defences which remove or degrade training on harmless datasets are less useful than ones that do
not under our threat model where defenders want to release these models such that they can still be
trained on harmless tasks.

3We note that stronger attacks with thorough hyperparameter search can still succeed against RepNoise
which we discuss in Appendix E.1 so it should not yet be considered as a comprehensive defence.

6


---Page Break---
We evaluate Trainability by testing whether the defended model can still be trained towards harmless
tasks. To this end, we measure the ROUGE-1 unigram overlap score on several text-to-data tasks from
the GEM benchmark [20]. In order to demonstrate trainability, we need to choose standard validated
tasks for natural language generation that models are poor (zero-shot) at before training (very low
ROUGE-1 scores) and achieve large performance increases in after training. We observe this for the
base llama2-7b-chat model seeing consistently low initial scores in table 4. For this setting, we
train the base model and its post-RepNoise version using 1 epoch and a learning rate of 8 × 10−5,
using only the training splits of each dataset. We perform evaluations on the test splits of respective
datasets. Full details of each dataset are given in appendix D.

The results in table 4 show that a llama2-7b-chat model hardened using RepNoise retains the
capability to be further trained on harmless tasks, despite not being able to be trained on harmful
tasks.

BeaverTails.

We further evaluated whether fine-tuning on a harmless task results in undoing safety guards or makes
models more susceptible to HFAs. After fine-tuning on each GEM dataset, a HFA is performed with
3 × 10−5 with 1k samples from BeaverTails as above. Unlike the results of Qi et al. [51], both the
base model and RepNoise are not made more harmful after harmless fine-tuning on GEM. However,
training on GEM does seem to make the HFA more effective (readers can compare with the same
attack in table 1). Even for RepNoise we see a small increase in attack efficacy after training the
model on CACAPO which indicates the possibility that additional harmless fine-tuning could undo
the RepNoise defence, a vulnerability which future work should explore.

We replicated the benign and AOA attacks of Qi et al. [51] results in appendix E.3 and found that
RepNoise can mitigate them.

4.4
Generalization

The BeaverTails dataset categorizes samples into 14 types of harm. We evaluate the generalization
performance of RepNoise by withholding five categories of harm when performing the defence
training and then evaluate the attack by performing an attack using 1k samples from that subset. We
also perform an additional experiment (Half) where RepNoise is trained using 5k randomly selected
samples from BeaverTails and a subsequent attack is performed using 5k unseen samples.

that these attacks are still in-distribution since the unseen types of harm are still drawn from the same

against unseen sample out-of-distribution which we demonstrate in appendix E.2 using a distribution
shift in the attack set to the HEX-PHI attack set [51]. A comprehensive analysis of additional attacks
(appendix E) and ablations (appendix J) are presented so readers can clearly understand the limitations
of RepNoise.

Mechanistic Analysis

We conjecture that RepNoise works because it reduces the information about harmfulness in repre-
sentations across all layers of the neural network, making them harder to recover. This is inspired by
observations from previous studies, which found that popular safety methods merely route around the
harmful representations [38], that fine-tuning only learns a wrapper on top of existing representations
[35], and that harmful representations are easily recovered [64].

Model Weights
To illustrate the above conjecture, we measure the change in the weights of each
layer across various defence mechanisms (a method common in unlearning literature, see Tarun et al.
[58] for example). In Fig. 2, we plot layer-wise L2 differences between the weights of the original
model or a defence and the weights of a harmfully fine-tuned base model (using BeaverTails with LR
8 × 10−5 @ 10k samples). We observe that defence using adversarial loss is indeed “superficial,” in
that the largest difference is observed in the last layers. In comparison, weight change across layers is
more uniform for RepNoise.

However, we can’t be certain what these weight changes mean. In order to actually test our conjecture
about depth, we perform RepNoise but freeze the top layers, the middle 10 layers, and the earliest 10
layers (table 6). Freezing the LM Head or the layers between 20 and 31 makes little to no difference
and not much difference for lower sample sizes freezing the last layer, freezing the middle layers
degrades the performance of RepNoise, and freezing the earliest layers results in a complete lack of
defence. This result confirms our conjecture about the necessity of “depth” for effective defence.

Token Probabilities
To investigate the degree to which harmful representations are removed across
layers we can look at how harmful and harmless token sequences are promoted throughout the
network. We look at the mean log probability of 100 randomly selected harmful and harmless

samples throughout the layers by placing the language model head on the activations across each
layer [7]. Confirming our findings above (Fig. 3) adversarial loss leads to a shallow defence that
mostly reduces the likelihood of the harmful token sequences towards the last layer. In contrast,
RepNoise demotes harmful tokens across layers mostly uniformly.

indicating comprehensive and deep information removal.

Knowledge Representations
Fig. 4 illustrates the representation space learned by each model.
After shallow defences, harmful representations maintain distinct structures along each of the two
principal component directions. While RepNoise maintains separability between harmful and harm-
less sequences along one of the principal components, the “spread" of each harmful representation in
both directions is dramatically reduced compared other models. This corroborates that RepNoise
has reduced the representation quality of the harmful samples since we can’t find a projection that
illustrates any meaningful structure between these samples.

To further analyze the information about harmfulness contained in the representations of different
models, we train a linear probe to predict whether an input to a model was harmful or not, based
on the mean activations at each layer of the model. Such a probe can achieve high accuracy by
using the information about harmfulness in the LLM. For each model, we input 15k examples from
BeaverTails, with half being unsafe, and collect the average activations across each layer for each
sample. We then train a binary linear classifier on 80% of them, measure the resulting accuracy on a
held-out test set, and repeat with 10 random seeds. 4

Across all models, the probes perform best in the middle layers and very poorly in earlier layers.
Figure 5a shows that an HFA does not improve the probe’s accuracy compared to the base model.
Similarly, an attack on a model defended by RepNoise also does not increase the information about

harmfulness (Figure 5c). This indicates that HFAs do not make an LLM more harmful by learning
new information about harmfulness, but merely use information already contained in the model.

The probe achieves significantly (Student’s t-test, p < 5e −12) lower accuracy on the model
defended by RepNoise than for a model defended by adversarial loss or the base model (Figure 5b).
This supports our suggestion that adversarial loss does not remove information about harmful
representations from the base model, but RepNoise does. Lastly, Figure 5c illustrates that fine-tuning
using harmful data does not result in relearning the information removed by RepNoise.

Related Work

Preserving the effects of safety fine-tuning
Some prior work addresses the attenuation of safety
fine-tuning’s influence on model behavior which typically occurs during benign fine-tuning. [71]
achieve this for LLMs with an instruction fine-tuning dataset which contains safety material and
[44] do so for LLMs by modifying the prompt template used during fine-tuning. [28] use a modified
LoRA algorithm for fine-tuning which maintains safety influence and [68] use a model fusion-based
technique to get around the limitations of performing safety fine-tuning either before or after fine-
tuning on tasks. Other solutions could benefit from methods that correct the general tendency for
models to perform more poorly in some domains after being fine-tuned in others, such as the method
presented in [46]. Though these methods may be sufficient for their stated goals, our work aims to
mitigate the effects of harmful fine-tuning, regardless of whether they come about from benign or
harmful fine-tuning.

Defence against harmful fine-tuning
Few works have attempted to defend against HFAs. Meta-
learning approaches have been used to reduce the fine-tunability of Language Models for harmful
classification tasks [24] and prevent image classification models from being fine-tuned on restricted
domains [14]. However, meta-learning approaches can be uninterpretable and too computationally
expensive for LLMs. [70] added a security vector during training to trick a model into thinking
that it has already learned the harmful task. [32] keep embeddings close to the original embeddings
by adding a perturbation loss called ‘Vaccination’ and [31] provides a similar defence by ensuring
that weights don’t drift too far from original weights during training. While [31, 32, 70] assume the
defender retains control over the fine-tuning process, we focus on settings where the defender cannot
intervene after the weights are released or stolen. For a full review of current HFAs and threat models,
we refer readers to [53].

Limitations

The primary limitation of RepNoise is that it is still possible to find ways to defeat it at higher
learning rates and with more data (appendix E.1). It is also sensitive to variations in hyperparameter
choices (appendix J). We have evidence that RepNoise could be improved quite simply by doing
more comprehensive hyperparameter searches and constructing larger defensive datasets. However,
our method requires paired safe and unsafe examples which makes data collection more expensive
and complex. Finally, while we did demonstrate across in-distribution harmful subsets in BeaverTails,
we did not observe out-of-distribution generalization from defences on harmful question-answering
to attacks using toxic content generation. Even smaller distribution shifts such as from defence
using BeaverTails to an unseen harmful question-answering dataset HEX-PHI (appendix E.2) can
break RepNoise —as such, future work should focus on improving the generalization capabilities of
RepNoise as it is unlikely that defenders will have access to samples with significant in-distribution
overlap with attackers which limits the effectiveness of our proposed method.

While our empirical settings and attacks provide promising first directions for LLM immunization
research, future work should invest in stronger attack settings to emulate worst-case attacks and
investigate different types of harm. Finally, our work is limited to supervised fine-tuning attacks in
LLMs. Additional settings in different modalities such as evaluating attempts at developing malicious
agents through harmful reinforcement learning (e.g., “reverse DPO” [67]) are a critical topic for
future research. We explored the implications of RepNoise for inference-time adversarial attacks
(appendix E.6) but future work should explore the robustness of RepNoise to additional types of
attacks like latent adversarial attacks [11], activation engineering-based attacks [3] or adaptive attacks
such as using decoding-time modifications [42] to circumvent our defence.

A
Proofs and Mathematical Details

A.1
Preliminaries

There are a number of terms used throughout the paper that require precise definitions where the
main text is only able to provide a concise introduction. In this section, we will formally define the
notions important to understanding the RepNoise algorithm and it’s theoretical analysis. First, we
consider the weights of a deep neural network denoted θ as the parameters which are learned using
some optimization procedure like that of the harmful fine-tuning procedure described in the main text
in eq. (1), typically using stochastic gradient descent which we will return to shortly. We rely on the
information bottleneck [59] view which states that neural networks form a Markov chain between the
following random variables: the inputs of the network X, the representation of those inputs Z, and
the outputs Y which can predicted only from the representations Z. Here, we draw on the notion of
representation from [2] which states that Z is a representation of X if in the chain described above Z
provides desirable properties for tasks involving Y . Here, the task of interest is predicting tokens
ˆY such that those predicted tokens minimize some loss function L( ˆY , Y ) over a reference token
distribution Y . In this paper, the representations Z will take the form of intermediate activations that
are built up through linear transformations and activation functions in the transformer models that
we use. Precisely, the neural network is the function fθ(x) = ˆy parameterized by θ composed of
activation functions zi+1 = h(θi · zi) where zi=0 is an initial embedding of x such as through the use
of a learned token embedding matrix common to LLM architectures and the final layer consists of an
unembedding layer such as a weight matrix over a vocabulary space with a softmax function. In this
process, since ˆy is predicted through the intermediate zi activations then zi meets the criteria of being
a representation of the initial input x. While the subspace that these activations span is completely
determined by the weights θ themselves, we will not be referring to weights as representations in this
paper.

To connect these representations back to an information-theoretic perspective, we will say that the
information of any given representation Z is the typical Shannon entropy measure of discrete random
variables H(Z) = E[−log p(Z)] where p(x) = P(X = x). In this paper, we are concerned not
with the information content of representations themselves but with the notion of mutual information:
the amount of information one random variable gives us about another random variable. Formally,
the (shannon) mutual information I(X; Z) is given by the information content H(X) minus the
conditional entropy (or information content) H(X|Z) for the formula I(X; Z) = H(X) −H(X|Z).
An equivalent distributional view of mutual information, which will will use later, can be given by
the Kullback-Leibler divergence I(X; Z) = Ex∼Px[DKL(P(z|x)||P(z)].

Given these tools we can represent a neural network as an information bottleneck which means that
there is a Markov chain Y ←Z ←X that has what is called a data processing inequality given by:
I(Y ; X) ≤I(X; Z). We can also derive two ideal properties [2] of representations: sufficiency - the
representations Z have the same essential information in X to pick out Y i.e. I(Z; Y ) = I(X; Z);
and minimality - the representations Z should contain as little information of the input space as
possible min I(X; Z). Finally, we present one more notion to formalize the idea of removing
information from a representation. We say that a representation Z has no information about a random
variable Y when the mutual information I(Z; Y ) is 0. The process of removing information more
precisely means reducing the mutual information between these two random variables. As long as
the sufficiency condition is met, removing information of representations Z and outputs Y doesn’t
reduce the predictive capabilities of a neural network. In the context of unlearning and the mitigating
learning harmful text sequences, we want to remove mutual information between representations Z
and outputs Y such that the sufficiency condition is not met and this is what we will mean precisely
when we say removing information in the paper.

Finally, we need to present a few preliminaries from [1] in order to make the theoretical analysis
clear. Below we will present a transition probability p(s2, t2|s1, t1) model which is a model of the
likelihood of transitioning from one state s1 to another s2 at time step t1 and t2, readers familiar
with reinforcement learning will recall that this is similar to the notion of a dynamics model of the
environment. The transition probability model will consider the likelihood of transitioning between
one set of model parameters θ1 to another set of parameters θ2 during the process of stochastic
gradient descent over some loss function Lθi. The loss landscape is the space (R|θ|) of the value of a
loss function LD at every value of θ. For simiplicity we are assuming this loss function is computed

17


---Page Break---
over all of the samples of a given dataset D to construct our theoretical loss landscape object. We will
develop a transition probability based on the static potential and reachability between two parameter
sets. The difference LDθi −LDθj between the loss for one parameter configuration θi and θj will be
called the static potential below. Reachability will be developed precisely below. Paths or training
trajectories in the loss landscape are the sequence of parameter configurations θi during a training
procedure

A.2
Deriving the approximate transition probability

Motivated by the transfer learning question: "How can we predict the success of training a model
originally trained on Task A to Task B", Achille et al. [1] present a transition probability that
determines the likelihood an initial model with parameters θ0 can traverse the loss landscape to find
the parameters θ∗that minimize the loss function LD which represents a loss like causal language
modelling loss on some dataset D. Here a Task is defined as a token output distribution over some
dataset D.

They posit the following transition probability p(θ∗, t∗|θ0, θ0) as equal to:

p(θ∗, t∗|θ0, t0) = e−1

(6)

As mentioned in the preliminaries static potential [U(θ∗) −U(θ0)] measures how far an initial set of
parameters is from a final set of parameters that minimize some loss term is given as the difference
of loss between those two models LDθ∗−LDθ0. The stochastic factor D comes from the author’s
derivation of the original equation from a Wiener process. Minimizing the static distance alone
is where our Gradient Ascent loss comes from. Note that D refers to a dataset and D refers to a
stochastic factor.

Reachability measures the likelihood of traversing the loss landscape (as defined above). Reachability
is determined by integrating over the “difficulty” of reaching θ∗by integrating over all of the parameter
configurations between θ0 and θ∗as well as the time steps it takes to reach θ∗starting from each
initial θ given by the outer integral. “Difficulty” is measured by the terms ˙w(t)2 + V (w(t)). ˙w is a
stochastic differential equation that depends on the gradients of LD with respect to the parameters θ
with some stochastic function
p

2n(t) i.e. ˙w = ∇LD(θ)+
p

2D(t). This term simply expresses that
the difficulty of a path is determined by how large the gradients are between parameter configurations.
V (w(t)) is given by 1

2f(θt)2 + ∇· f(θt) where f(·) takes the gradients of the loss function with
respect to the parameters w at time step t. We also have an additional divergence term which measures
properties of gradient flow on the path at θt reaching θ∗.

Our simplified eq. (2) in the main paper consists of simplifying eq. (6) with the following steps and
assumptions:

We observe that we can construct a simpler presentation for the main paper removing stochastic
factors. If we properly estimate these factors this would only make the transition probability smaller
due to the stochastic factor D being the denominator of the reachability term as well as the stochastic
factor
p

2D(t) increasing the magnitude of the reachability term. In other words without stochastic
factors, it is even more likely to reach θ∗and a minimizer of the deterministic transition probability
would also minimize the stochastic transition probability.

Our second strong assumption is that the divergence across all paths is set to some constant, in our
case again it is replaced with 0. We realize that the divergence of the gradients of a loss function with
respect to some parameters might play a major role in the transition probability: for example, if the
divergence is always negative with a large magnitude, it is easy to rapidly traverse the loss landscape
to θ∗and the transition probability would be much larger than otherwise expected without this term.
Similarly, if the divergence is always positive with a large magnitude then the transition probability
would be much smaller than expected. For our work, we only assert an approximate estimation of
the transition probability where the divergence term and stochastic factors are necessary for a more
accurate transition probability.

Based on these modifications we get the following approximate simplification that we use in the main
paper and in the proof below:

(7)

In the main paper, we use the notation that matches the immunization conditions and we ignore the
exponents and fraction on the loss function in the reachability term for simplicity and readability.

We note that in order to construct a loss function which maximizes divergence we would need access
to information about the curvature of the loss landscape through the Hessian which we we leave to
future work. Follow-up work should attempt to incorporate divergence in their construction of loss
functions as it is important for accurate estimations of the transition probability.

A.3
Proof of Theorem 1

Theorem 1
Consider a set of initial weights θt=0 as well as weights θt∗that minimize a loss function
LD over the dataset D. The θt=0 that minimize the transition probability p(θt∗, t∗| θt=0, t = 0) are
given by the weights θt=0 that minimize the mutual information I(X; Zθ) between the inputs to a
neural network X drawn from D and the intermediate activations of that neural network Zθ used to
represent those inputs given the model weights θ. For which we have the minimizer argmin
θ
I(X; Zθ).

Recall from above that the magnitude of the gradient of the loss function LD with respect to the
model parameters θ determines the reachability term in eq. (7).

This quantity can be connected with mutual information using theorem 2 which is from Wang et al.
[63] where we direct readers to for its proof:

Theorem 2. Let ˆY be the predicted label output by an neural network with input X, and suppose
that Y is a ground truth next token label (in the form of a one-hot vector over a vocabulary) for the
input X. If the KL divergence loss DKL(P( ˆY )∥P(Y )) increases, the mutual information between the
representations Z and ground truth outputs Y , I(Z; Y ) will decrease.

First we point out that, in this context, the KL divergence loss over a one-hot target vector is the same
as the cross entropy loss (see the equivalence in appendix A.4). So we will refer to cross entropy loss
increase as a way to decrease I(Z; Y ).

Second, observe that we maximize cross entropy loss by taking the following gradient steps: θt+1 =
θt + η∇LDθ. By theorem 2, increasing cross entropy loss increases the magnitude of the gradient of
the loss function LD with respect to the model parameters θ. As established above, this magnitude
is equivalent to the reachability term and therefore increasing cross entropy loss increases the
reachability term which in turn minimizes the transition probability of finding the parameters θ that
minimize LD.

By definition, maximizing cross entropy loss also increases the static potential term of the transition
probability since it increases the loss of the initial parameters θ which will be used to attempt to train
towards θ∗.

The final step assumes the markov chain Y ←Z ←X and the data processing inequality introduced
in the preliminaries. We also assume that minmizing I(Z; Y ) also minimizes the cross entropy
loss resulting in an increase in static potential and reachability, this can be seen from the definition
of mutual information above. We must now to connect increase cross-entropy loss to a minmizer
of I(X; Z) and the minimization of I(X; Z) to the minimization of both the static potential and
reachability. From information bottleneck theory [65], we have the data processing inequality,
I(X; Y ) will always be less than or equal to I(X; Z) and therefore a minimizer of I(X; Z) is a
minimizer of I(X; Y ) which in turn is a minimize of I(Z; Y ). By theorem 2 we saw that increasing
cross entropy (CE) loss decreases the quantity I(Z; Y )

We can then deduce that argmin
θ
I(X; Zθ) is also then a maximizer of the reachability term, the

static potential term, and therefore minimizes the transition probability in eq. (7). This completes the
proof ■.

We note that by the data processing inequality again, we have the added benefit that we can continue
to reduce I(X; Z) even when I(Z; Y ) is fully reduced which could assist us in tasks where we want
to fully reduce both the predictive (I(Z; Y )) and representative (I(X; Z)) information for Z.

A.4
Equivalence of KL and Cross Entropy

In some contexts minimizing the KL divergence loss and the cross entropy loss are equivalent. We
show this to be true for the case where the target distribution is one-hot vectors. This is the case for
language modeling loss, the focus of our work, where we have the true token represented as a one-hot
over the vocabulary distribution.

The KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions P and Q:

DKL(P||Q) =
X

i
P(i) log P(i)

Q(i),
(8)

Cross entropy loss is a measure of the error between a true distribution P and a predicted distribution
Q is:

H(P, Q) = −
X
P(i) log Q(i),
(9)

For one hot vectors the true distribution P is represented as P(c) = 1 and P(i) = 0 for i ̸= c where
c in the true class index and i indexes all other classes over a distribution of class labels (in the case
of LLMs this is the label of the true token in a distribution over a vocabulary of tokens).

Since P is a one-hot vector we can rewrite the KL eq. (8) as:

DKL(P||Q) =
X

i
P(i) log P(i)

Q(i)
(10)

= 1 · log
1
Q(c) +
X

i̸=c
0 · log
0
Q(i)
(11)

= −log Q(c),
(12)

Similarly we can rewrite the cross entropy loss as:

H(P, Q) = −
X
P(i) log Q(i)
(13)

= −1 · log Q(c) +
X

i̸=c
0 · log Q(i)
(14)

= −log Q(c),
(15)

Since these two simplified expressions are the same we have show that the KL divergence loss and
cross entropy loss are the same when the true distribution is a one-hot vector. ■

B
Implementation

B.1
Implementation of Representation Noising

This section provides further details about the implementation of the RepNoise method.

Since we don’t have access to the true distribution of harmful representations Zharmful, we need an
estimator of this distribution using samples from our dataset. Additionally, since the KL divergence
is not a distance metric itself, it may not be the best way to minimize the distributional difference
between harmful representations and Gaussian noise. Because of this, we use multi-kernel Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with a Gaussian kernel (as in Wang et al. [63]) which estimates a
distribution over harmful samples. We can further sample from Gaussian noise in N(0, I) and
measure the distributional distance from harmful samples in a manner that is differentiable with
MMD.

20


---Page Break---
Finally, we implement the gradient ascent ℓascent and representation noising ℓnoise parts of our loss
function layer-wise in order to minimize the mutual information I(X; Z) as much as possible. For
each training step of RepNoise, we perform this across all of the post-MLP but pre-residual activations
of each layer. The pre-residual activations were chosen because the representations become similar
to the previous layer after adding the residuals thereby losing unique information about the given
layer. We experimented with incorporating activations at various parts such as post-attention but
the pre-residual activations were most effective. For our layer-wise gradient ascent losses, we use a
similar approach to the tuned lens [7] and use the language model head on top of each activation to
compute language modelling loss at each layer. The full implementation of our approach is given
below in algorithm 1. We also draw the reader’s attention to the MASK operation. This is because
we use paired refusal data for our method where the first part of a question or prompt is shared
between the harmful and harmless target text. We don’t want to perform gradient ascent or noise
the representations of these shared tokens which is why a mask is required. The mask is simply the
tokens that a paired sample has in common. Finally we mention that in practice ℓascent can be very
large and dominate the loss function, this is why we take the log of ℓascent.

Training details for the main results

For the results presented in § 4 and § 5, we use the following settings unless otherwise stated. For
Table table 1 and table 2 we perform RepNoise and other defences on the same samples as the attack.
This is the best-case defence scenario when the defender has access to the same samples as the
attacker. For Table table 5 and table 20 we perform RepNoise on samples that are not used for the
attack to show the ability to generalize where we see that there is very little difference made whether
we immunize on the same samples as the attack or not illustrating that RepNoise still works when the
defender does not have access to the same samples as the attacker but has access to the same domain.
Post-attack evaluations are always performed on unseen samples.

For the BeaverTails attack, we train RepNoise for 1 epoch on 10k paired samples (10k harmful
questions with harmful answers and 10k of the same questions with safe answers or refusals)
using α = 1, β = 0.001, learning rate (LR) 2 × 10−5. A batch size of 8 is used throughout the
experiments. These settings were found after performing a grid search over α ∈{4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1},
β ∈{2, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001}, lr ∈{8 × 10−8, 1 × 10−5, 2 × 10−5, 3 × 10−5, 8 × 10−5, 1 ×
10−4, 1 × 10−3}, and 1, 2, and 4 epochs. The results of this search are presented in appendix J. For
Decoding Trust RTP split, we used 4 epochs for immunization, a learning rate of 2 × 10−5, α = 2
and β = 4. A random seed of 42 is used for all experiments unless otherwise stated, this number
was chosen randomly and not optimized against. We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a 10%
warmup and use the Adam optimizer without any weight decay. Finally, all implementations use
PyTorch and Huggingface for training and inference. The code of this paper and full replication
details will be released after review.

C
Attack Setting Details

For the attack, we perform supervised fine-tuning to reduce causal language modelling loss on a
harmful dataset (see section 2). We also evaluate the attacks from Qi et al. [51] and find that they
do not increase the harmfulness of our base model appreciably (0.04 →0.06 harmfulness on our
classifier using all the same settings for the 100-shot attack)5. Therefore we construct a set of stronger
attacks. The strength of our attack depends on the number of samples and a chosen learning rate. For
the main paper results we present a sampling of learning rates at the order of magnitude 10−5 since
we observed that optimization using learning rates at lower than (3 × 10−5) did not result in harmful
models. Using learning rates at a higher order of magnitude (5 × 10−4) often resulted in models with
disfluent outputs. For the sake of convenience and concision, we arbitrarily select three learning rates
({3 × 10−5, 6 × 10−5, 8 × 10−5) but we present a more comprehensive analysis across learning rates
in table 7. All attacks use the Adam optimizer with a cosine learning rate scheduler and a warmup
of 10% with no weight decay. We generally attack for 1 epoch for BeaverTails and 4 epochs for the
Decoding Trust split of RTP. As in Qi et al. [51] greedy sampling is used in all attacks. We illustrate
the effects of sampling on our attacks in appendix J.

disfluency.
The harmful dataset used for attack and defence consists of 10k randomly sampled harmful question-
answer pairs from the BeaverTails HarmfulQA Dataset [36]. This dataset samples questions from 14
domains such as ‘hate speech’ and ‘animal abuse’ and contains responses generated by a model that
was not safety trained which human annotators then labelled as safe or unsafe. We discuss the full
details for this dataset in appendix D.

To evaluate an LLM’s propensity for harmful outputs, we evaluate it on unseen prompts from the
BeaverTails dataset and measure the mean probability of the harmfulness labels across all responses.
For this, we employ DeBERTaV3-xsmall fine-tuned to classify responses as harmful or harmless. We
do this based on the observation by [36] that standard content moderation and harmfulness evaluators
such as OpenAI’s content moderation or the Jigsaw Perspective API classifier fail to adequately
classify harmful question-answering. We don’t consider more general evaluation techniques such as
zero-shot by GPT-4 or by LlamaGuard since we preferred a lighter-weight alternative trained and
validated specifically on BeaverTails 6.

Classifier training and results are presented in appendix D.

Dataset and Model Details

BeaverTails

BeaverTails [36] is a harmful question-answering dataset that was constructed for AI safety and
alignment research consisting of 333,963 question-answer pairs annotated by crowdworkers as safe
or unsafe. Unsafe pairs are categorized into 14 types of harm. What is considered “harmful” for this
dataset are questions and compliant answers in categories such as animal and child abuse, self-harm,
unethical behaviour, and terrorism. The questions are based on the prompts from [17] where the

authors of BeaverTails used Alpaca-7b to produce harmful responses. To construct our attack
dataset, we initially filtered this dataset for only unsafe questions with unsafe answers.

Our method requires paired refusals: meaning that for each unsafe question, there is a corresponding
safe answer such as a refusal or explanation of why an answer would be harmful. Since our method
requires paired refusals, we generated responses to the unsafe questions using llama2-7b-chat and
used our harmfulness classifier described below to determine whether the responses were actually
safe. The resulting dataset is 18,106 samples which is what we use for both our immunization and
attack dataset.

D.1.1
Harmfulness Classifier

From the observations of [36], typical harmfulness evaluation techniques such as using the OpenAI
content moderation API 7 or the Jigsaw Perspective API classifier [39] don’t work well for determining
whether a question-answer pair is harmful. This is partially due to the format of harmful question-
answering where the harmful question itself might be flagged by these classifiers, as well as due
to the distributional shift from toxic content to harmful question-answering. While some works
[32, 51, 70] have relied on GPT-4 for harmfulness evaluation, we feel this approach is not well
validated empirically and can be very expensive for extensive evaluations. Instead, we use the same
approach as [36] and train our own harmfulness classifier on the 330k samples of safe and unsafe
question-answer pairs from BeaverTails which allows us to compare our classifier performance with
human annotations. We train a deberta-v3-xsmall [23] model for 4 epochs on this dataset using a
batch size of 128, Adam optimizer, and learning rate of 6 × 10−6. Our classifier achieves an F1 score
of 0.87.

In the main text we compute the harmfulness score based on the trained harmfulness classifier in
the following way. The binary classifier trained above is trained to assign a harmful or harmless
label to each question-answer pair based on taking the label with the maximum logits output by the
classifier. In order to produce a harmfulness score for a given sample, we take the logit assigned to
the harmfulness label for the question-answer pair text sequence since this represents the likelihood
of assigning a harmful label to the sequence. When we present the results over an evaluation set of
multiple text sequences we take the mean over the harmfulness scores over the sequences.

To validate our approach we present the supplementary study in table 8. This study is performed on the

three models. We use responses from the base llama2-7b-chat before any attack, a successfully

same attack. We leverage the code from [51] for using a LLM-as-judge for harmfulness. This judge

rates (on a 5-point scale) whether GPT-4 8 agrees or disagrees with the generated answer to a harmful
question violates OpenAI’s model usage policy which is given in the judge instructions. The OpenAI
content moderation API and Perspective API are free to use content moderation tools that have been
used in the past for conducting harmfulness evaluation [36]. We find that table 8 in particular [51]’s
LLM-as-judge correlates well with our harmfulness classifier (Spearman’s ρ = 0.77), the other two
metrics have moderate to weak positive correlations (Spearman’s ρ = 0.42 for Perspective API and
Spearman’s ρ = 0.17 for OpenAI’s content moderation API).

D.2
Decoding Trust Toxicity Split

For the “toxicity” fine-tuning attacks and defences we used the RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) [19] split
from the DecodingTrust benchmark [62] since it filters RTP for toxic and non-toxic continuations
and provides a framework for evaluating toxicity generation in LLMs by using a prompt asking the
LLM to continue a toxic snippet. As above, since we need paired refusals for our method, we filter
the content for toxic continuations only and generate continuations from llama2-7b-chat resulting
in 351 samples. To evaluate the toxicity of continuations, we use the same approach as [62] and
leverage the Jigsaw Perspective API [39]. This toxicity evaluator was originally designed for content
moderation purposes for text very similar to RTP and is widely used for toxicity evaluation in similar
contexts.

Eleuther LM Harness

For stability evaluations (Table 3), we use tasks drawn from the Eleuther LM Harness9 which
is a common tool for the evaluation of LLMs general zero and few-shot capability post-training.
We selected the top tasks used for evaluating language models on the Huggingface open LLM
leaderboard 10. These were TruthfulQA [41], MMLU [26], Hellaswag [69], and ARC (easy) [13]. We
also evaluate changes in the model’s capabilities on domains related to harmfulness on the Ethics [25]
and Crows S pairs [48] that are found in the LM harness (additional safety evaluations are performed
in appendix E).

D.4
GEM

For trainability (whether the defended model can be continued to be trained on harmless tasks), we
select two datasets from the GEM benchmark [20] which is designed to evaluate natural language
generation. The datasets we selected were ViGGO (video game review [37] 5.1k train/1.08k test),
E2E NLG (restaurant dialogue [15] 33.5k train/1.85k test), DART (Multiple [47] 62.7k train/5.1k

(Weather Reports [5] 25.4k train/3.1k test) and we used the text-to-data task where the model
must generate some abstract meaning representation or structured data representation given natural
language texts. We chose this because it wasn’t something llama2-7b-chat was good at doing
before training and training produced a large increase in the ROUGE-1 scores (see the low initial
scores in table 4). The reader will notice that while we use the exact same training set-up as the
attack setting many of these datasets are larger than our attack sample set, we point out that ViGGO
is smaller than our attack set and training is still effective. For some examples of what these tasks
look like, see below:

Additional Safety and Harmfulness Evaluations

In order to understand the impact of our method on more general LLM Safety we performed three
additional evaluations: benign and identity-shifting fine-tuning attacks (appendix E.3), language
model bias evaluation (appendix E.4), exaggerated safety evaluations (appendix E.5), and adversarial
attacks (appendix E.6). We also present empirical results on a few successful attacks on RepNoise-
hardened models (appendix E.1), and cross-domain generalization (appendix E.2)

E.1
Stronger Attack on RepNoise

Beyond the results in table 1 we were able to find an attack that defeats our method starting at
3 × 10−4 @ 10k (resulting in a post-attack score of 0.74). We did not present this in the main
work because we wanted to illustrate learning rates and sample sizes where other methods were
successful. Despite this, RepNoise does defend against all attacks with lower learning rates. We
observed that learning rates higher than 8 × 10−4 ruined the model’s text generation quality. We
also found successful attacks when increasing the epoch number to 2 but only for learning rates at
8 × 10−5 and above at 10k samples. Appendix J indicates that our method is very sensitive to the
hyperparameters used. For instance, when setting the random seed to 17, RepNoise is able to defend
up to 3 epochs at 8 × 10−5 and can defend against all learning rates with 10k samples for 1 epoch
until the degeneration learning rate. Yet for a random seed of 7 RepNoise is defeated at 8 × 10−5
for 1 epoch but not at learning rates before. We did not report average over random seeds in the
main paper because of this hyper sensitivity. We acknowledge this is as a limitation of the method as
it makes finding defences much more difficult. However, the random seeds were cherry-picked as
the standard seed of 42 was used in all reporting. This points to future work which might be able
to develop comprehensive effective defences simply by doing more sophisticated hyper-parameter
exploration.

E.2
Cross-Domain Generalization

While we demonstrated that our method can generalize across different subsets table 5 and number of
samples used table 20, we were additionally curious whether our method provides a ‘cross-domain’
defence, meaning that performing the RepNoise defence using samples from one task could provide
defence against samples drawn from an unrelated task.

We evaluate how well our method generalizes between the BeaverTails dataset and the RealTox-
icitiyPrompts (RTP) split from the DecodingTrust benchmark [62]. While BeaverTails contains
potentially unsafe question-answer pairs, RTP consists of prompts likely to be followed by toxic
completions which is a very distinct domain.

Table 9: Cross-domain generalization: Harmfulness scores after attacks with learning rates ∈{3 × 10−5,
6 × 10−5, 8 × 10−5} and immunization using RepNoise on different datasets.

Table 9 illustrates that defence trained on DecodingTrust improves upon the base model’s resistance
against weak attacks using BeaverTails. However, defences trained on BeaverTails actually decrease
resistance against weak attacks using DecodingTrust. On both BeaverTails and DecodingTrust, it
is much more effective to defend using the same dataset used for the attack. This means that while
RepNoise does provide generalization where the defender doesn’t have access to the same samples as
the attacker, RepNoise does not appear to provide resistance to cross-distribution attacks where we
have no samples at all from the domain of the attack. We don’t find this a surprising result or major
limitation given that out-of-domain performance is an expected limitation of current neural methods.
However, it does mean that defenders using our method will need to be sure they comprehensively
collect defence samples from the domains they want to prevent training on.

We perform another distribution shift attack by leveraging the HEX-PHI dataset [51] consisting of
330 harmful questions drawn from 11 harmful categories such as Economic or Physical Harm. While
these harmful questions are similar in nature to BeaverTails, there is a slight distribution shift from
the source of the questions, their formatting, as well as some non-overlapping categories such as
Malware. Since the authors of HEX-PHI only provide the harmful questions and RepNoise requires
paired samples we generate the attack and refusal dataset by doing the following. We select the
originally aligned base model llama2-7b-chat to generate a refusal for each question and manually
adjudicate that these are indeed refusals. We select the attacked base model from table 1 (8 × 10−5)
to generate the unsafe answers and manually adjudicate that these are indeed unsafe answers. Using
this dataset we perform an attack using the following setup. Instead of using vanilla PyTorch as is
done in the rest of the paper, we use the supervised fine-tuning trainer from the TRL library11. We
use the following training parameters: we use an AdamW optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999,
ϵ = 1e −8 with no weight decay. We use a learning rate starting from 2e −5 with a linear decay.
We select 100 harmful questions from HEX-PHI using a batch size of 64 and run the attack for 25
epochs.

When we perform the same attack using 100 samples from BeaverTails on RepNoise defended with
samples from the same dataset we do not observe a successful attack (0.06 harmfulness). However,
we find that training the RepNoise defence on BeaverTails using the same set up as appendix B.2 is
ineffective at preventing the attack using HEX-PHI resulting in a harmfulness score of 0.74. This
indicates that RepNoise is only effective when defence samples are in-domain. To further test this
claim, we perform the RepNoise defence using 230 non-overlapping samples from HEX-PHI for 1
epoch using a learning rate of 3 × 10−4 with the rest of the settings the same as appendix B.2. After
extending the RepNoise defence we achieve 0.01 harmfulness on the held-out 100 samples used for a
HEX-PHI attack.

E.3
Benign and Identity Shifting fine-tuning Attacks

Qi et al. [51] observed that even benign fine-tuning could accidentally make models more harmful by
increasing the likelihood of following harmful instructions. Using the same setting of fine-tuning
models on 10 harmless samples illustrating an absolutely obedient agent (Identity shifting) and 52,002
samples from the (Benign) Alpaca instruction-following dataset, we find that RepNoise defends
against both benign and identity shifting attacks. On the identity shifting attack (10 epochs), the
base lama2-7b-chat’s outputs go from a harmfulness rating of 1.02 to 4.2 when using [51]’s GPT-4
to judge (on 5 point scale where 1 is not harmful and 5 is completely harmful) on their harmfulness
evaluation dataset. In contrast, RepNoise (α = 2, β = 4, LR= 2 × 10−5) goes from 1.03 to 3.4. We
also performed the benign fine-tuning attack training the model on Alpaca instruction following [57]
where the base model went from 1.02 to 1.68, RepNoise was slightly more susceptible to the benign
fine-tuning attack where the model went from 1.16 to 2.13 which is still far from a large increase in
harmfulness.

E.4
Bias Evaluation with ROBBIE

The ROBBIE suite of robust bias evaluation [16] allows us to ask whether our defence has any
impact on the overall demographic bias of the model. We used 100 random samples drawn from each
ROBBIE benchmark and the Jigsaw Perspective API evaluator [39] to evaluate bias (in addition to
the other evaluation procedures presented in [16]). Using the RepNoise defence with the settings
presented in the main paper, we find that our method doesn’t have any significant impact on the bias
of the original model (Mann-Whitney U-test, p ∈[0.15, 0.72]). Despite the fact that we are removing
information about harmful representations, we cannot say this makes the model appreciably less
biased.

E.5
Exaggerated Safety with XSTest

Röttger et al. [54] provides a set of evaluations for understanding "exaggerated safety" where models
might refuse to answer harmless questions which only superficially seem unsafe for example asking
about the definition of a bomb rather than how to construct a bomb. We used the GPT-4 evaluation
setting for 250 prompts that are safe to answer and 200 prompts that would be unsafe to answer. In
table 11, we observed that applying RepNoise does result in a small but significant increase in safe
refusals (χ2-test, p < 0.01). While there is a similar slight decrease in unsafe question compliance,
this result was not significant (χ2-test, p = 0.09). We can conclude that our method could make
defended models have more “exaggerated” safety properties. Notably RepNoise increases the number
of partial refusals (a combination of safe and unsafe answer such as intructions given but an ethical
concern expressed) for both safe and unsafe questions. We include baselines from SmoothLLM
[52] as well as a Paraphrase baseline [34] in order to illustrate the effectiveness of popular baseline
methods for defending against inference-time adversarial attacks. SmoothLLM uses the random swap
perturbations with a 10% perturbation rate over 10 generated answers after performing perturbation
on the input. The Paraphrase baseline, uses gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 to construct a paraphrase
of the given input using the instructions "paraphrase the following sentence:" before inputting the
prompt into the model. We see that while these methods arre effective at improving safe compliance
rate, they improve compliance including for unsafe answers.

E.6
Adversarial Attacks with HarmBench

How does our method impact inference-time adversarial attacks like jailbreaks?
We examine
this question using the HarmBench [45] benchmark with the following methods GCG [72], ZeroShot
[50], HumanJailbreak [43, 56], and DirectRequest [50]. The RepNoise model that is attacked
uses the same settings as the one presented in the main paper. For demonstration purposes, we use
the “harmful” and “illegal” subsets of HarmBench which consists of 64 test cases that a language

model should normally refuse to answer since the answer would be harmful. Table 12 illustrates
that our method does provide a small decrease in susceptibility to GCG-based attacks but it is not
statistically significant (χ2-test, p = 0.32). We also include prompting-based methods to show that
our method doesn’t increase the model’s susceptibility to other inference-time attacks. Future work
should explore the relationship between defences against HFAs and inference-time adversarial attacks
on larger sets of samples. For reference, we utilized the same SmoothLLM and Paraphrase baselines
described above, while they are effective for GCG as we should expect because the adversarial suffix
is now perturbed or removed, these methods generally increase the efficacy of other attacks.

F
Security Vectors

Security Vectors [70] is a defence where the defender has access to and complete control over
the fine-tuning process. The defence consists of training a LoRA adapter [29] represented by the
parameters θs, the so-called “security vector”, using the harmful causal language modelling loss
outlined above in eq. (1) while the rest of the language model’s parameters are frozen. During the
HFA (see § 2), the defender activates the adapter θs during all forward passes. However, the security
vector is frozen while the rest of the parameters θ from the base model are being trained. The authors
base their method on the observations from [30] that if the training loss is already very small to begin
with, then little learning will take place.

For our experiments, we trained the LoRA adapter with a 1 × 10−3 learning rate as suggested in the
paper and trained the model for 1 epoch on eq. (1) to minimize causal language modelling loss on our
10k harmful samples from the BeaverTails dataset. We believed that this would be a fair comparison
because it the same number of samples RepNoise defence uses. We did not perform the min-min
bi-level optimisation procedure as details for this process were missing from the paper.

G
Harmfulness probes

We repeat the probing experiments from Section 5 for RepNoise when we use β = 0.001 instead
of β = 4. This setting leads to higher resistance by putting less importance on increasing the loss
on harmful examples. Again we train a linear probe on the activations for 15k samples of question-
answer pairs from BeaverTails to predict whether the answer is harmful or not. We measure the
accuracy of the resulting probe to indicate how much information the representations at each layer of
a model contain about harmfulness. However, it should be noted that probes have been criticised as a
interpretability method [6] due to their susceptibility to spurious correlations.

Figure 6a shows that RepNoise slightly reduces the information about harmfulness compared to the
base model and the model defended by the Adversarial Loss. The average accuracy across layers
of RepNoise was 0.003 lower than for the base model (Students t-test, p = 0.065). This differs
from Figure 5b since RepNoise with β = 0.001 reduces the information about harmfulness less than
RepNoise with β = 4. This might imply that the ℓascent term plays an important role in removing
information about harmfulness.

Figure 6b underlines the finding from Section 5 that HFAs do not increase the amount of information
about harmfulness. However, in the setting with β = 0.001 we find that attacking the defended model
even reduces the information about harmfulness. Compared to the RepNoise model the RepNoise +
Attack model a probe achieves 0.006 accuracy less (Students t-test, p = 0.0004). This might imply
that RepNoise with β = 0.001 is able to navigate the weights to an advantageous position in the loss
landscape.

Table 13: Freezing earlier layers prevents effective defence indicating that the “depth” of the defence is critical.

In the main paper, we hypothesize that the effectiveness of our defence is due to its depth. By depth,
we mean how many layers down we are removing information about harmful representations. We
can test whether this is the case by freezing layers during RepNoise and then performing our attacks
from the main paper. Using a 32-layer LLM (llama2-7b-chat we freeze the LM Head, the last
layers (32, 20-31), the middle layers (10-20) and the last layers (0-10). table 6 shows that freezing
the LM head or “unembed” layer makes little difference. We have a similar finding for freezing the
last layer, except in the case of longer attacks, which is interesting given that a simple adversarial
loss defence makes the most changes in the last layer fig. 2. Finally, we see that freezing the middle
layers starts to degrade the effectiveness of the defence and freezing the first ten layers completely
ruins the effectiveness of the defence. This shows that RepNoise conducts important operations on
early layers of the model and thus provides a “deep” defence.

Analysis of Attacked Models

We extend our analysis from § 5 by presenting an illustration of what the token probability distributions
and PCA characterization look like on successfully attacked models after performing a defence. These
results use the same setting from § 5 using 100 harmful and harmless samples from the BeaverTails
harmfulQA task. The defence performed with adversarial loss is successfully attacked at 8 × 10−5
@ 10k. RepNoise is successfully attacked at 3 × 10−4 @ 10k. Figure 7 reveals that the probability
distribution of drawing harmful token sequences after a successful attack is largely the same as the
distribution from the original attacked model.

Figure 7: Log probability of harmful and harmless sequences across layers. Notice how adversarial loss mostly
depromotes harmful tokens towards the last layer, while this is done more evenly across layers for RepNoise.

Figure 8 shows a PCA of 100 harmful and harmless samples. It indicates that the representation space
between an attacked and unattacked base model is not that different. For the adversarial loss defence,
we discussed this representation space change earlier but we point out that the representation space
largely returns to a similar space as the base model after a successful attack. As for RepNoise, observe
that in order for the attack to be successful we produce a representation space where both harmful
and harmless representations are largely collapsed on some kind of manifold. This observation could
help us develop further extensions to RepNoise which make it more robust.

Is noise loss necessary?
We performed an ablation study (table 14) removing the noise term and
the gradient ascent terms. We find that both the noise and gradient ascent term are required to
construct strong defences. Note that the noise term by itself without ascent results in a model that
is even worse at defence than the original base model. We believe that this is the case because
simply noising harmful representations without explicitly trying to remove their predictive power
could be contributing to improving the minimality properties of the representations themselves (the
ideal property that representations contain as little information about the input as possible are more
effective), see the relationship between learnability and minimality for representation learning in
[65].

Table 15: Harmful fine-tuning attacks on RepNoise without masking or layer-wise gradient ascent.

Is masking and layer-wise ascent necessary?
In appendix B.1 we introduce two components to
our algorithm which we ablate in table 15. These are a mask that masks out the harmful question
common to both the harmless and harmful text sequence. We do this to avoid sending gradient signals
back through the noise and gradient ascent terms over the harmful question itself as we want to
maintain the ability to understand and appropriately answer harmful requests with safe answers. We
also introduce layer-wise ascent over predicted harmful text sequences using the activation at each
layer. This is a mechanism to remove the mutual information between representations and harmful
text sequences across model layers. In the ablation study in table 15 we see that both mechanisms
are essential. Without masking, the algorithm is less stable as the representations of the harmful
question itself are now incorporated into the the harmless loss and the harmful ascent loss creating
contradictory gradient signals as well as the noise term which encourages unwanted noising of the
representations of the question. Without the layer-wise ascent loss, RepNoise is not as effective for
removing harmful information.

RepNoise is very sensitive
During our investigations we found that our method is unfortunately
very sensitive to hyperparameter variations, requiring extensive hyperparameter search to be effective.
We illustrate these shifts in Table 16,17,18, and table 19 while searching for the hyperparameters
for the model whose results are in the main body of the paper. Generally, the α value for ascent
made little impact so it is not recorded here. We believe this is due to the high dimensionality
of the representations that we are removing information from with our noise term. Since we are
composing a matrix of representations that consist of the token embedding size by the number of
tokens in the context, this is a very large object we are noising. Additionally we are doing this
for each layer. Such a large scale noising procedure would naturally be subject to high variance
depending on hyperparameters used. In the future, we could mitigate this issue by projecting the
harmful representations down to a much smaller space that preserves the most important information
such as by taking the top-k singular values. By applying noising to this much smaller object, we
are reducing the variance in the training process while still removing harmful information from
representations.

the number of samples has a major impact on the quality of defence. We show this in the sample

experiment with more extensive data collection and augmentation to improve our defence. Additional
work could be done to make defence methods more sample-efficient. Unfortunately, our method
relies on paired refusal data as we observed without this defences were much more fragile, however,
future work could also investigate methods that don’t require paired refusal data.

the number of samples used to train the defence.

What if we use nucleus sampling?
Finally, we investigate the effect of sampling on our defence.
In table 21 we compare the effect of using greedy or nucleus [27] sampling on attack effectiveness.
We see that there is very little difference depending on the sampling technique.

Table 21: Sampling study comparing the use of greedy or nucleus sampling, there is very little difference of the
attack effectiveness and the sampling method used.

We corroborate this finding by illustrating the mean log probabilities of 100 harmful and harmless
sequences at the last layer of our base llama model, a superficial defence like adversarial loss and our
method (fig. 9). We observe that both defences make the likelihood of drawing tokens for harmful
sequences much lower than the base model or a successfully attacked model. Naturally, successful
attacks decrease the divergence in distributions between harmful and harmless sequences. We could
use this observation to investigate explicitly leveraging distributional distance losses in order to make
closing this gap more difficult for the attacker.

K
Additional Models

We validated our approach for additional models by performing RepNoise on the larger
llama2-13b-chat model and a series of smaller Qwen 1.5 models (0.5B to 7B) [4]. We evaluate
these models using the same attack settings as table 1. As mentioned above, one of the limitations of
our method is that it requires very extensive hyperparameter tuning. For each model, we performed a
grid search across the following learning rates (1 × 10−3, 5 × 10−4, 1 × 10−4, 5 × 10−5, 1 × 10−5)
and β values (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.25, 1). For the Qwen 1.5 series of models, we found
1 × 10−3 with β = 0.25 to be the most effective. For llama-13b-chat, we similarly found a higher
learning rate of 1 × 10−3 most effective with β = 0.001. While our results are effective in these
settings, we highlight the need for stronger more comprehensive attacks as well as future work that
makes RepNoise require less extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Table 22: Results from various models with and without RepNoise applied. RepNoise is effective across a

For the cases where the harmfulness score is very low this is often the case of a “self-destructing”
model [24] where the modes outputs completely degrade as a result of training which is in contrast to
a model that preserves fluency across the attack. These are illustrated below selected from random
examples from the series of models above:

Impact of RepNoise on models without safety guards

While the purpose of RepNoise is to preserve the safety guarding behaviour that has already been
developed in LLMs before their release, in this section we provide an analysis of the effects of
RepNoise on unaligned models. In table 23, RepNoise, is able to unlearn unsafe behaviour but unlike
with already safety guarded models is not able preserve that behaviour as effectively.

Statement on Compute Usage and Cost of RepNoise

We primarily used a single node with 4XA100 (80GB VRAM) GPUs for our results. Occasionally
we used 4XA40 (40GB VRAM) GPU nodes as well as 1XA100 (40GB VRAM) from Google Colab.

To compute the runtime and cost of RepNoise and associated attacks we present the following analysis.
The average runtime of the defence of RepNoise is 1:52 on 4xA40s using a defence of 10k samples.
As of July 31st 2024 the cost on RunPod12 with $0.35 CAD/hr would be roughly $2.80 if we take two
full hours. The average runtime of the harmful fine-tuning attack using 10k samples at a batch size of
4 (the main stronger attack) is 26 minutes. This would be $1.40 on RunPod if we took the whole
hour. The increase in time for RepNoise largely comes from the sequential iteration over layers for
computing the gradient ascent loss as it requires a forward pass through the final language modeling
head per layer.

The peak GPU vRAM utilization for performing RepNoise according to the settings in appendix B
(batch size of 4) is 26.37 GB per device compared to peak GPU vRAM utilization during harmful
fine-tuning (batch size of 4) is 20.81 GB.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We believe all the claims are clearly reflected in the abstract, introduction, and
conclusion. We believe they all accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope and
believe that all claims are satisfactorily tested by a variety of tests which converge to the
same results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Throughout the whole paper we illustrate limitations with our method such as
sensativity to hyperparameter variation, defeat of our method at higher learning rates and
epochs, lack of more harmful tasks to evaluate on, limitation of our domain authorization
method to harmful tasks only, etc. We also repeated these explicitly in a limitations section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

35


---Page Break---
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide a proof sketch in the inital paper as well as a full proof in the
appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide extensive details on all of the settings, datasets, hyperparameters
etc that are used such that the paper should be easily reproducable. To our knowledge there
are no missing details that would prevent replication.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

36


---Page Break---
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We will be providing the code for our method and complete instruction for
replication shortly but it is not provided with submission since we need more time to make
sure the code is easy to understand and run. We don’t believe this is a blocker to review
because our method should be completely reproducible with ease given details from the
paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We took great lengths to make sure these are all very clearly stated in the
appendices.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

37


---Page Break---
Justification: For all the major results we performed Mann-Whitney U-tests as well as X2
tests where appropriate.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: A seperate appendix is given for these.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed the code of ethics and are sure our paper conforms to it.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

38


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We attempted to give a convincing overview of this in the introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defences in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper is about constructing safe guards!
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No assets requiring licenses are provided with this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

39


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets were created in the paper that can’t be easily reproduced given
the details of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

40


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
