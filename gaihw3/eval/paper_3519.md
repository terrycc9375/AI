Abstract

Recent advances in real-time neural rendering using point-based techniques have
enabled broader adoption of 3D representations. However, foundational approaches
like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose substantial storage overhead, as Structure-from-
Motion (SfM) points can grow to millions, often requiring gigabyte-level disk
space for a single unbounded scene. This growth presents scalability challenges
and hinders splatting efficiency. To address this, we introduce LightGaussian,
a method for transforming 3D Gaussians into a more compact format. Inspired
by Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussians with minimal global
significance on scene reconstruction, and applies a pruning and recovery process
to reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality. Knowledge distillation and
pseudo-view augmentation then transfer spherical harmonic coefficients to a lower
degree, yielding compact representations. Gaussian Vector Quantization, based on
each Gaussian’s global significance, further lowers bitwidth with minimal accuracy
loss. LightGaussian achieves an average 15× compression rate while boosting
FPS from 144 to 237 within the 3D-GS framework, enabling efficient complex
scene representation on the Mip-NeRF 360 and Tank & Temple datasets. The
proposed Gaussian pruning approach is also adaptable to other 3D representations
(e.g., Scaffold-GS), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Introduction

Novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to generate photo-realistic images of a 3D scene from unobserved
viewpoints, given a set of calibrated multi-view images. This capability has widespread applications

in virtual reality [1], augmented reality [2], digital twins [3], and autonomous driving [4]. Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [5–7] have shown promise in 3D modeling from multi-view images by
mapping 3D locations and view directions to view-dependent color and volumetric density, with pixel
intensity rendered through volume rendering [8]. However, NeRF and its variants face limitations
in rendering speed, limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, voxel-based
representations [9–13], hash grids [14], and neural light fields [15] have been developed. Despite
improvements, these methods often compromise between quality and speed.

Recent progress in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) [16] has enabled real-time rendering
with photo-realistic quality for complex scenes. By representing the scene with explicit 3D Gaussians
and using a splatting technique [17], 3D-GS balances speed and quality, making it suitable for
large-scale scenarios like digital twins and autonomous driving. However, point-based methods incur
high storage costs, as each point and its attributes require independent storage. Additionally, heuristic
densification of sparse SfM points into dense Gaussians often results in overparameterization, leading
to excessive storage and slower rendering speeds. For instance, a typical unbounded 360-degree
scene in 3D-GS [7] may require over 1GB of storage (e.g., 1.4GB for the Bicycle scene).

In this paper, we address storage and rendering speed issues by developing a compact representation
that retains the original rendering quality. The heuristic densification process in 3D-GS results in
significant redundancy. Our method, LightGaussian, reduces redundancy by targeting both Gaussian
count (N) and feature dimension (F) through a comprehensive pipeline:

• To reduce Gaussian count (N), we propose a Gaussian Pruning and Recovery step, identi-
fying and removing Gaussians with minimal impact on visual quality, followed by recovery
to ensure smooth adaptation.

• For compressing features (F), we introduce an SH Distillation process to compact higher-
degree spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients, supported by pseudo-view augmentation.
Additionally, we employ Vector Quantization (VQ) to adaptively select a codebook of Gaus-
sian attributes (e.g, positions, scales, and rotations), reducing precision for less significant
features and applying quantization-aware fine-tuning to maintain quality.

In summary, LightGaussian achieves substantial compression (e.g., from 782MB to 45MB) while
maintaining visual fidelity (SSIM decrease of only 0.007 on Mip-NeRF 360). Rendering speed also
improves, reaching over 200 FPS on complex scenes. Our Gaussian Pruning and Recovery method
generalizes well, enhancing performance across different 3D Gaussian formats, such as Scaffold-GS.

Efficient 3D Scene Representations.
Neural radiance fields (NeRF) [5] use multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) to represent scenes, setting new standards for view synthesis quality. However, NeRF
models face challenges with slow inference speeds, limiting practical use. Efforts to address this
have explored ray re-parameterizations [6, 7], explicit spatial data structures [18–21, 9, 14, 13],
caching and distillation techniques [15, 22–24], and ray-based representations [25, 26]. Nevertheless,
achieving real-time rendering remains challenging for NeRF methods, especially for large-scale
scenes where multiple queries per pixel hinder performance.

Point-based representations, like Gaussians, have been explored in various applications, such as
shape reconstruction [27], molecular modeling [28], and point-cloud replacement [29], as well as in
shadow [30] and cloud rendering [31]. Pulsar [32] demonstrated efficient sphere rasterization, while
3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) [16] applies anisotropic Gaussians [33] with tile-based sorting to
achieve real-time speed and quality comparable to MLP-based methods like Mip-NeRF 360 [7].

Despite its strengths, 3D-GS has high storage demands due to the extensive attributes stored with each
Gaussian, often requiring gigabytes per scene and hindering rendering efficiency. Recent concurrent
works address these issues by using region-based vector quantization [34], K-means codebooks [35],
view-direction exclusion [36], or learned binary masks and grid-based neural networks instead of
spherical harmonics (SHs) [37] to reduce model size.

with the least significance. Next, SH coefficients are distilled into a compact format using synthesized
pseudo-views. Finally, vector quantization, including codebook initialization and assignment, reduces
model bandwidth.

pruning [39, 40] eliminate parameters at the weight level and neuron/channel levels, resulting in a
smaller, more efficient architecture. Iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), where low-magnitude weights
are progressively removed, has proven effective in methods like lottery ticket rewinding [41, 42].

Vector quantization (VQ) [43] compresses data by representing it with discrete codebook entries
(tokens), using mean square error (MSE) to select the closest match in the codebook for each data
vector. Prior studies [44–46] have shown that learning discrete, compact representations enhances
visual understanding and model robustness. VQ has thus been widely applied in image synthesis [47],
text-to-image generation [48], and novel view synthesis [18, 49, 50].

Knowledge Distillation.
Knowledge Distillation (KD) [51–54, 15] trains a smaller student model
by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model [55]. In 3D vision, KD has been applied
to neural scene representations, leveraging view renderings to incorporate 2D priors. For example,
DreamFusion [56] and NeuralLift-360 [57] use pre-trained diffusion models for 3D generation, while
models like DFF [58], NeRF-SOS [59], INS [60], and SA3D [61] distill 2D image feature extractors
to 3D tasks. KD has also been central to compressing scene representation models [15, 24].

Methods

Overview.
The LightGaussian framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. The 3D-GS model is trained on
multi-view images, initialized from SfM point clouds, and expanded to millions of Gaussians to
represent the scene comprehensively. Our pipeline then processes the 3D-GS model into a compact
format using Gaussian Prune and Recovery to reduce the number of Gaussians, SH Distillation to
eliminate redundant SHs while retaining key lighting information, and Vector Quantization to store
Gaussians with lower bit-width.

3.1
Background: 3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) [16] is an explicit point-based 3D scene representation, utilizing
Gaussians with various attributes to model the scene. When representing a complex real-world scene,
3D-GS is initialized from a sparse point cloud generated by SfM, and Gaussian Densification is
applied to increase the Gaussian counts that are used for handling small-scale geometry insufficiently
covered and over reconstruction. Formally, each Gaussian is characterized by a covariance matrix Σ
and a center point X, which is referred to as the mean value of the Gaussian:

  \l a be l

 {f ormul a : gaus si an's formula} \text {G}(\boldsymbol {X})=e^{-\frac {1}{2}\boldsymbol {X}^T\boldsymbol {\Sigma }^{-1}\boldsymbol {X}}, \boldsymbol {\Sigma } = \mathbf {R}\mathbf {S}\mathbf {S}^T\mathbf {R}^T, 
(1)
where Σ can be decomposed into a scaling matrix S and a rotation matrix R.

The complex directional appearance is modeled by an additional property, Spherical Harmonics (SH),
with n coefficients,

ci ∈R3|i = 1, 2, . . . , n
	
where n = D2 represents the number of coefficients
of SH with degree D. A higher degree D equips 3D-GS with a better capacity to model the view-
dependent effect but causes a significantly heavier attribute load.

When rendering 2D images from the 3D Gaussians, the technique of splatting [62, 17] is employed
for the Gaussians within the camera planes. With a viewing transform denoted as W and the Jacobian

opacity values (top). Simply utilizing Gaussian opacity as an indicator for pruning the least important
Gaussians results in the rendered image losing intricate details (bottom), with the PSNR dropping
from 27.2 to 25.3. This has inspired us to find better criteria to measure global significance in terms
of rendering quality. The accumulated Probability Density Function(PDF) is equal to 1.

of the affine approximation of the projective transformation represented by J, the covariance matrix
Σ′ in camera coordinates can be computed as Σ′ = JW ΣW T JT . Specifically, for each pixel, the
color and opacity of all the Gaussians are computed using the Gaussian’s representation Eq. 1. The
blending of N ordered points that overlap the pixel is given by the formula:

Here, ci, αi represents the view-dependent color and opacity, calculated from a 2D Gaussian with
covariance Σ multiplied by an optimizable per-3D Gaussian’s opacity. In summary, each Gaussian
point is characterized by attributes including: position X ∈R3, color defined by spherical harmonics
coefficients SH ∈R(k+1)2 × 3 (where k represents the degrees of freedom), opacity α ∈R, rotation
factor R ∈R4, and scaling factor S ∈R3.

3.2
Gaussian Pruning & Recovery

Gaussian densification [16], which clones and refines the initial SfM point cloud, enhances small-scale
geometry and detailed scene appearance by improving coverage. While this approach significantly
boosts reconstruction quality, it increases the number of Gaussians from thousands to millions
after optimization, resulting in substantial storage demands.Inspired by neural network pruning
techniques [63] that remove less impactful neurons while preserving overall performance, we propose
a tailored pruning strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting to reduce over-parameterized points while
maintaining accuracy. Identifying redundant yet recoverable Gaussians is essential to our approach.
However, pruning Gaussians based on simple criteria (e.g., point opacity) risks degrading modeling
performance, as it may eliminate essential scene details, as shown in Fig. 3.

Global Significance Calculation.
Inspired by Eq. 2, we go beyond using Gaussian opacity alone
to assess significance by evaluating 3D Gaussians within the view frustum, projecting them onto the
camera viewpoint for rendering. The initial significance score of each Gaussian (denoted as G(Xj))
can then be quantified based on its contribution to each pixel (ray, ri) across all training views using
the criteria 1(G(Xj), ri) whether they intersect or not. Consequently, we iterate over all training
pixels to calculate the hit count of each Gaussian. The score is further refined by the adjusted 3D
Gaussian’s volume γ(Σj) and 3D Gaussian’s opacity σj, as they all contribute for the rendering
formula. The volume calculation equation of the j-th 3D Guassian is V(Σj) = 4

3πabc, where abc are
the 3 dimensions of Scale (S). We also consider the transmittance T is calculated with one subtract
all the 3D Gaussian’s opacity the ray hit before the j-th 3D Gaussian, T = Qj−1
i=1 (1- σi). Finally, the
global significance score can be summarized as:

 \l a

(3)

where j is the Gaussian index, i denotes a pixel, and M, H, and W represent the number of training
views, image height, and width, respectively. 1 is an indicator function that determines whether a
Gaussian intersects a given ray. However, using Gaussian volume alone tends to overemphasize
background Gaussians, leading to excessive pruning of Gaussians modeling fine geometry. Thus, we
propose a more adaptive approach to measuring volume dimensions:

 \la b el {eq:vo

g amma

 (\Mat
 {
\Sigma }) &= (\text {V}_{\text {norm}})^\beta , \\ \nonumber \text {V}_{\text {norm}} &= \text {min}\left (\frac {\text {V}(\Mat {\Sigma })}{\text {V}_{\text {max90}}}, 1\right )
.

Here, the calculated Gaussian volume is firstly normalized by the 90% largest of all sorted Gaussians,
clipping the range between 0 and 1, to avoid excessive floating Gaussians derived from vanilla 3D-GS.
The β is introduced to provide additional flexibility.

Gaussian Co-adaptation.
We rank all Gaussians by their global significance scores to quantitatively
guide pruning of the lower-ranked Gaussians. The remaining Gaussians are then jointly adapted by
fine-tuning their attributes—without additional densification—to offset the minor loss from pruning.
This adaptation is performed using photometric loss on the original training views, aligned with
3D-GS training for 5,000 iterations.

3.3
Distilling into Compact SHs

In the uncompressed Gaussian Splat representation, a substantial 81.3 percent of the feature dimension
is occupied by Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients, requiring (45+3) floating-point values per
splat. Directly reducing the SH degree can save disk space but also diminishes surface “shininess”
and affects specular reflections.

To balance model size with scene quality, we introduce a knowledge distillation approach. Knowledge
is distilled from a teacher model with full-degree SHs to a student model with truncated, lower-degree
SHs. Supervision is based on the difference in predicted pixel intensities between the two models,
with images synthesized at camera positions by sampling around each training view according to a
Gaussian distribution:

  \mathc a

} \left  \lVert  \Mat  {C}_{\text {teacher}}(r_i; [\mathbf {R}|\mathbf {t}]) - \Mat {C}_{\text {student}}(r_i; [\mathbf {R}|\mathbf {t}]) \right \rVert _2^2. \\ \mathbf {t}_{\text {pseudo}} &= \mathbf {t}_{\text {train}} + \mathcal {N}(0, \sigma ^2),
(6)

where R and t denote rendering camera rotation and position, tpseudo and ttrain represent the newly
synthesized and training camera positions, respectively. N denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean
0 and variance σ2, which is added to the original position to generate the new position.

3.4
Gaussian Attributes Vector Quantization

Vector quantization (VQ) clusters voxels into compact codebooks, enabling high compression rates.
However, quantizing Gaussian attributes in a point-based, inherently non-Euclidean representation
poses notable challenges. Our empirical findings indicate that applying quantization across all
elements—especially for attributes like position, rotation, and scale—results in significant accuracy
losses and a marked reduction in precision when represented discretely.

We propose applying VQ to the Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients, based on the assumption that
a subgroup of 3d Gaussians typically exhibits a similar appearance. Fundamentally, VQ segments
the Gaussians  \ math cal  { G }  = \{ \mathbf {g}_1, \mathbf {g}_2, \ldots , \mathbf {g}_N \} (here we apply it on SH) to the K codes in the codebook
 \ math cal  { C }  = \{ \mathbf {c}_1, \mathbf {c}_2, \ldots , \mathbf {c}_K \} , where each  \m at h bf {g}_j, \mathbf {c}_k \in \mathbb {R}^{d} and K ≪N. d means SH dimension. We aim to
strike a balance between rendering quality loss and compression rate by leveraging the pre-computed
significance score from Eq. 3. Based on this, we apply VQ selectively on the least significant elements
in the Spherical Harmonics (SHs). Specifically, we initialize C via K-means, iteratively sample a
batch of G, associates them to the closest codes by euclidean distance, and update each ck via moving
average rule: ck = λd · ck + (1 −λd) · 1/Tk · P

gj∈R(ck) GSj · gj, where Tk = P

gj∈R(ck) GSj
is the significance score (Eq. 3) which is assigned to the code vector ck, R(ck) is the set of Gaussians
associated to the k-th code. λd = 0.8 represents the decay value, which is utilized to update the

Global Significance (GS) to target less crucial Gaussians mitigates this loss. Some attributes (e.g.,

scores, LightGaussian achieves an effective balance between model size and quality.

Implementation Details.
Our framework is implemented in PyTorch and integrates the differen-
tiable Gaussian rasterization technique from 3D-GS [16]. All performance evaluations are conducted
on an A6000 GPU. In the Global Significance Calculation phase, we assign a power value of 0.1 in
Eq. 4 and proceed to fine-tune the model for 5,000 steps during the Gaussian Co-adaptation process.
For SH distillation, we downscale the 3-degree SHs to 2-degree, thereby reducing 21 elements for
each Gaussian. This is further optimized by setting σ to 0.1 in the pseudo view synthesis stage.
In the Gaussian VQ step, the codebook size is configured to 8192, selecting SHs with the least
60% significance score for the vector quantization (VQ ratio), to balance the trade-off between
compression efficiency and fidelity.

Experimental Results

Quantitative Results.
We assess the performance of various methods for novel view synthesis,
with quantitative metrics summarized in Tab. 1. This includes efficient voxel-based NeRFs like
Plenoxel [12] and Instant-NGP [14], the compact MLP-based Mip-NeRF360 [7], vector-quantized
NeRF [49], and 3D Gaussian Splatting [16].

On the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, MLP-based NeRF methods achieve competitive accuracy with compact
representations but suffer from slow inference speeds (0.06 FPS), limiting their practicality. Voxel-
based NeRFs improve rendering efficiency but still fall short of real-time performance; for example,
Plenoxel requires 2.1GB for a single large-scale scene. In contrast, 3D-GS offers a good balance
between quality and speed but demands substantial storage per scene.

Our method, LightGaussian, exceeds existing techniques with rendering speeds over 200 FPS, enabled
by efficient rasterization that prunes insignificant Gaussians. This approach reduces 3D Gaussian
model redundancy, cutting storage from 782MB to 45MB on Mip-NeRF360—a 15× reduction.
LightGaussian also outperforms 3D-GS on the Tank & Temple datasets, nearly doubling rendering
speed and reducing storage from 380MB to 22MB.

Qualitative Results.
We conducted a comparative analysis of rendering results between 3D-GS and
LightGaussian, focusing on intricate details and background regions, as shown in Fig. 4. Both 3D-GS
and LightGaussian exhibit comparable visual quality, even in challenging scenes with thin structures,
showing that LightGaussian effectively removes redundancy while preserving reconstruction fidelity.

Generalization to Other Point-based Representations
We further apply our Gaussian Pruning
approach to Scaffold-GS [67], an advanced neural Gaussian-based 3D representation. In this method,
we prune Gaussians that contribute minimally to scene reconstruction, reducing redundancy while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments on the MipNeRF360 dataset demonstrate that pruning 80%
of neural Gaussians increases the rendering speed from 152 to 178 FPS, as shown in Tab. 5. These
results underscore LightGaussian’s potential as an effective optimization tool for other Gaussian-based
representations.

4.3
Ablation Studies

We performed ablation studies on each component of our method to evaluate their individual impacts.
Results show that Gaussian Pruning and Recovery effectively removes redundant Gaussians, retaining
only those crucial for scene representation. SH Distillation reduces the Spherical Harmonics degree,
simplifying the lighting model with minimal quality loss. Furthermore, Vector Quantization efficiently
compresses the feature space, creating a more compact representation. Combined, these modules
substantially improve the overall efficiency and performance of our framework.

Significance Criteria
To identify the optimal criteria for measuring each Gaussian’s global sig-
nificance, we evaluated key characteristics: Gaussian-ray interaction count, Gaussian opacity, and
functional volume. Tab. 3 illustrates that integrating these three factors — by weighting the hit count
with opacity and Gaussian volume — yields the highest rendering quality post zero-shot pruning. A
quick Gaussian Co-adaptation (the last row) which optimizes the remaining Gaussians, can effectively
recover the rendering accuracy to its pre-pruning level. The visual comparison of rasterized images,
before and after pruning, alongside the depiction of pruned Gaussians, is presented in Fig. 5.

knowledge distillation from the full model (Exp #4 →5) allows for size reduction while preserving
essential viewing effects. Additionally, incorporating pseudo-views during training (Exp #5 →6)
demonstrates the effectiveness of simulated views in enhancing the learning of specular reflections.
While applying VQ to all attributes yields poorer results (see Tab. 4), this impact is mitigated by
leveraging Gaussian Global Significance.

as Gaussian Pruning & Recovery, SH Distilling, and VQ. As depicted in Fig 6, we note a marked
decline in rendering quality when the pruning ratio reaches 70%, with a more rapid deterioration as
the VQ ratio approaches 65%. In Tab 6, we observe that 2-degree SH compactness reduces the SSIM
from 0.927 to 0.926, while 1-degree SH compactness further reduces it to 0.923.

Conclusion, Limitations, and Broad Impact

We present LightGaussian, a novel framework that transforms heavy point-based representations
into a compact format for efficient novel view synthesis. Designed for practical use, LightGaussian
leverages 3D Gaussians to model large-scale scenes, effectively identifying and pruning the least
significant Gaussians generated through densification. It achieves over 15× data reduction, boosts
FPS to over 200, and minimally impacts rendering quality. Exploring zero-shot compression across
various 3D-GS-based frameworks remains a promising direction for future research.

Broadly, LightGaussian’s compact representation has the potential to democratize high-quality 3D
content for applications in VR, AR, and autonomous driving by reducing resource demands, enabling
more accessible and scalable deployment across industries. While we do not foresee any significant
risk from this specific technique, 3D reconstruction may infringe on personal privacy when applied in
public spaces or with drone footage, contradicting our ethical intentions.

Post-Finetuning of Vector Quantization.
Applying vector quantization (VQ) based on the sig-
nificance score facilitates a reduction in the required codebook size compared to the full model.
Nonetheless, this method results in a decrease in accuracy as it groups the attributes into several
clusters (codes). We observe that the SSIM decreases from 0.923 (#6) to 0.915 (#7), as illustrated
in Table 2 of the main draft. This observation motivates us to joint optimize all other attributes and
the codes post the VQ. Specifically, by assigning a unique code to each Gaussian, we proceed to
implement differentiable finetuning using photometric loss, which is similar to the methodology

precise adjustments to the codebook and the rest attributes, improving its alignment with the training

More Experiment Results

In addition to realistic indoor and outdoor scenes in the Mip-NeRF360 [7] and Tank and Temple
datasets [65], we further evaluate our method on the synthetic Blender dataset [5], and provide a
scene-wise evaluation on all datasets, accompanied by detailed visualizations.

Results on NeRF-Synthetic 360°(Blender) Dataset.
The synthetic Blender dataset [5] includes
eight photo-realistic synthetic objects with ground-truth controlled camera poses and rendered
viewpoints (100 for training and 200 for testing). Similar to 3D-GS [16], we start training the model
using random initialization. Consequently, we calculate the Global Significance of each Gaussian,
work to reduce the SH redundancy, and apply the Vector Quantization (codebook size set at 8192) to
the learned representation. Overall comparisons with previous methods are listed in Table 7, where
we observe our LightGaussian markedly reduces the average storage size from 52.38MB to 7.89MB,
while improving the FPS from 310 to 411 with only a slight rendering quality decrease.

Additional Qualitative Results on Mip-NeRF360.
We provide extra visualizations for 3D-GS [16],
LightGaussian (ours), and VQ-DVGO [49], accompanied by the corresponding residual maps from the

ground truth. As evidenced in Figure 8 and Figure 9, LightGaussian outperforms VQ-DVGO, which
utilizes NeRF as a basic representation. Furthermore, LightGaussian achieves a comparable rendering
quality to 3D-GS [16], demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed compact representation.

Additional Quantitative Results on Mip-NeRF360.
Tables 8, 9, and 10 present the comprehensive
error metrics compiled for our evaluation across all real-world scenes (Mip-NeRF360 and Tank and
Temple datasets). Our method not only compresses the average model size from 782MB to 45MB,
but also consistently demonstrates comparable metrics with 3D-GS on all scenes. LightGaussian
additionally shows better rendering quality than Plenoxel, INGP, mip-NeRF360, and VQ-DVGO.

Implementation Details of VQ-DVGO.
In the implementation of VQ-DVGO [49], we initially
obtain a non-compressed grid model following the default training configuration of DVGO [9]. The
pruning quantile βp is set to 0.001, the keeping quantile βk is set to 0.9999, and the codebook size is
configured to 4096. We save the volume density and the non-VQ voxels in the fp16 format without
additional quantization. For the joint finetuning process, we have increased the iteration count to
25,000, surpassing the default setting of 10,000 iterations, to maximize the model’s capabilities. All
other parameters are aligned with those specified in the original VQ-DVGO paper [49], ensuring a
faithful replication of established methodologies.

Overall Analysis.
We report the performance of the investigation on the proposed modules in
Tab. 2 and Fig. 7. We verify that our design of Gaussian Pruning & Recovery is effective in removing
redundant Gaussians (Exp #1→3) with negligible quality degradation while preserving rendering
accuracy. This proves that the proposed global significance, based on principle of splatting, accurately
represents the critical aspects of each Gaussian. By removing the high-degree SHs and transferring
the knowledge to a compact representation (Exp #3 →5), our method successfully demonstrates the
benefits from using soft targets and extra data from view augmentation, results in negligible changes
