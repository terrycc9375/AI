Abstract

Accurate motion forecasting for traffic agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query
corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While
straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future tra-
jectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically
evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that
decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing
distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent’s dynamic states
over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality
and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and
state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representa-
tion of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce
combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation
and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths. Extensive ex-
periments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
our DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting.

Introduction

Motion forecasting [29, 58, 67] empowers self-driving vehicles to anticipate how surrounding agents
will move and affect the ego car, providing references and conditions for the ego-action. It is critical
for maintaining safety and dependability, enabling vehicles to comprehend the dynamics of driving
environments and make calculated decisions. The challenges and complexities of this task arise
from various factors, including unpredictable road conditions, varied movement patterns of traffic
participants, and the necessity to simultaneously analyze the states of observed agents along with the
road maps.

The research community has witnessed significant progress in the representation of driving
scenes [18, 36, 44] and the paradigm of trajectory decoding [26, 38, 54, 77]. These methods
have achieved substantial advancements in prediction accuracy, primarily following a certain pattern
inspired from detection [4, 40], i.e., the one-query-one-trajectory paradigm [38, 54, 59, 77]. This
paradigm utilizes several queries to represent different estimated trajectories, as shown in Figure 1 (a),
covering the possibilities of distinct motion intentions. Although effective, these approaches can only
approximately provide a direction and collect surroundings to generate various trajectory waypoints
in a one-shot fashion, overlooking the detailed relationships with scenes. The lack of concrete
representation for trajectories and comprehensive spatiotemporal interactions with the surrounding

Figure 1: The primary distinction between previous methods and ours lies in the representation of
future trajectories. Previous methods, as depicted in (a), use only one mode query for each trajectory.
Our approach, illustrated in (c), utilizes decoupled mode queries, as shown in (a), and state queries,

environment and among each other might lead to a decline in accuracy and consistency across varying
time steps.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework dubbed DeMo, which provides a detailed
representation of multi-modal trajectories. Specifically, we decouple forecasting queries into two
types: besides the original motion mode queries to capture different directional intentions as shown
in Figure 1 (a), we introduce the dynamic state queries for future trajectories to track the agent’s
dynamic states across various time steps, as shown in Figure 1 (b). This approach allows us to
achieve a comprehensive query representation within our framework, as illustrated in Figure 1 (c).
Mode queries and state queries are processed using the Mode Localization Module and the State
Consistency Module, respectively. These modules enable the explicit interactions of queries with the
surrounding environments and among each other, by which the directional accuracy and temporal
consistency of future trajectories are significantly optimized. Subsequently, two types of queries
are integrated by our Hybrid Coupling Module to achieve a comprehensive representation of future
trajectories. Due to the sequential nature of trajectory states, Mamba is particularly well-suited
for modeling the temporal consistency of dynamic states. Therefore, we utilize a combination of
Attention and Mamba in our modules to effectively and efficiently aggregate global information and
model state sequences, leveraging the strengths of both techniques.

Our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) We propose a motion forecasting framework that
decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into mode queries and state queries to represent directional
intentions and dynamic states, respectively. (ii) We design three modules based on integrated
Attention and Mamba to process decoupled mode queries, state queries, and coupled mode and state
queries. (iii) Extensive experiments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate
that DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motion forecasting.
In recent advancements in autonomous driving, it is critical to effectively
predict the movements of relevant agents by accurately representing scene components. Tradi-
tional methods [5, 20, 48] transformed driving scenarios into image formats and used conventional
convolutional networks for scene context encoding. However, these techniques often failed to suffi-
ciently capture intricate structural details. This challenge has led to the adoption of vectorized scene
representations [26, 60, 75, 79], exemplified by the introduction of VectorNet [18]. Additionally,
graph-based structures are also widely utilized to represent the relationships between agents and their
environments [14, 21, 30, 31, 36, 50, 69].

Existing methodologies have delved into a variety of frameworks to predict multi-modal future
trajectories given the scene features. Initially, prediction techniques were centered on goal-oriented
methods [26, 71] or employed probability heatmaps to sample trajectories [20, 21]. However,
contemporary strategies, such as MTR [54] and QCNet [77], among others [41, 43, 44, 73], utilize
Transformer [61] models to analyze relationships within the scene. Additionally, the introduction

Figure 2: Overview of our DeMo framework: The HD maps and agents are first processed by the
encoder to obtain the scene context. The decoding pipeline includes: (a) the Mode Localization
Module, which processes mode queries by interacting with the scene context from the encoder and
among themselves; (b) the State Consistency Module, which processes state queries; and (c) the
Hybrid Coupling Module, which combines these queries to generate the final output. The feature

of novel paradigms such as pre-training [7, 8, 34], historical prediction design [46, 59], GPT-style
next-token prediction [49, 53], and post-refinement [9, 76] in some techniques has led to remarkable
advancements in performance.

Furthermore, the advancements in multi-agent forecasting aim to enhance the applicability of pre-
dicted trajectories for various agents in real-world scenarios. Several approaches [22, 55, 79] follow
an agent-centric model, where trajectories are forecasted individually for each agent, a process that
might be slow. On the other hand, alternative approaches [44, 78] utilize a scene-centric model that
allows for simultaneous forecasting across all agents, introducing an innovative approach to trajectory
prediction.

Inspired by the progress in object detection and motivated by its significant success [4, 40], main-
stream methods [38, 54, 59, 77] have adopted a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm to achieve high
performance in motion forecasting benchmarks [6, 58, 67]. These methods use transformers to model
the relationship between each trajectory query and its environment but lack detailed representa-
tion. We propose decoupled mode queries and state queries for a more detailed and comprehensive
representation of multi-modal trajectories.

State space models.
Originally developed for modeling dynamic systems with state variables in
fields such as control theory, state space models (SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives
to Transformers [61] in sequence modeling, particularly due to their effectiveness in addressing
attention complexity and capturing long-term dependencies. As SSMs have evolved [17, 25, 56],
a new class termed Mamba [24], which incorporates selection mechanisms and hardware-aware
architectures, has recently demonstrated significant promise in long-sequence modeling. Several
studies have explored Mamba’s substantial potential across a range of fields, including natural
language processing [27, 37] and computer vision [28, 35, 74, 80]. Notably, in the vision domain,
Mamba has demonstrated superior GPU efficiency and effectiveness compared to Transformers
in tasks such as visual representation learning [80], video understanding [35], and human motion
generation [74]. Building on these achievements, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first method
to combine the strengths of Mamba with mainstream Transformer-based architecture to achieve
impressive performance.

Methodology

In this section, we present DeMo, which utilizes decoupled mode queries and state queries for
directional intentions and dynamic states to predict future trajectories. We also employ a hybrid
architecture combining Attention and Mamba, along with two auxiliary losses for feature modeling.

Problem formulation

Given HD map and agents in the driving scenario, motion forecasting aims to predict the future
trajectories for the interested agents. The HD map comprises several polylines of lanes or crossings,
while agents are traffic participants like vehicles and pedestrians. To transform these elements into
easily processable and learnable inputs, we utilize a popular vectorized representation following [18].
Specifically, the map M ∈RNm×L×Cm is generated by dividing each line into several shorter
segments, where Nm, L, and Cm denote the number of map polylines, divided segments and feature
channels, respectively. We represent the historical information of agents as A ∈RNa×Th×Ca, where
Na, Th, and Ca are the number of agents, historical timestamps, and motion states (e.g., position,
heading angle, velocity). Additionally, the future trajectories Af ∈RNaoi×Tf×2 for agents of interest
are estimation objectives, with Naoi, Tf indicating the number of selected agents and the future
timestamps, respectively.

3.2
Scene context encoding

Given the vectorized representations A for agents and M for HD map, we first employ individual
encoders to process them separately. Specifically, we use a PointNet-based polyline encoder, as
described in [8, 54, 55], to process the map representation M, generating the map features Fm ∈
RNm×C. For the agents A, we replace generic Transformer [61] or RNN with several Unidirectional
Mamba [24] blocks, which are more efficient and effective for sequence encoding, to aggregate
the historical trajectory features Fa ∈RNa×C up to the current time. Subsequently, the scene
context features Fs ∈R(Na+Nm)×C are formed by concatenating them and further propagated to a
Transformer encoder for intra-interaction learning. The overall process can be formulated as:

Fm = PointNet(M),
Fa = UniMamba(A),
Fs = Transformer(Concat(Fa, Fm)).
(1)

3.3
Trajectory decoding with decoupled queries

After obtaining the scene context features, we aim to decode multi-modal future trajectories for
each interested agent based on our proposed decoupled queries. As illustrated in Figure 2, the
decoder network comprises a State Consistency Module that enhances the consistency and accuracy
of dynamic future state queries, a Mode Localization Module for learning distinct motion modes,
and a Hybrid Coupling Module to integrate the decoupled queries and generate the final output. The
detailed description of these components are provided in the following.

Dynamic state consistency.
Considering the recurrence and causality of the future trajectories
Af, we propose to represent them as a series of dynamic states across various time steps, distinct
yet interconnected. To preserve precise time information, the state queries Qs ∈RNaoi×Ts×C are
initialized with an MLP module for real-time differences. It is notable that the steps Ts can differ from
Tf to balance the effectiveness and efficiency, especially when predicting long-term future trajectories
or a higher frequency of future trajectories. The State Consistency Module is then employed to
enhance the consistency of the state queries and aggregate the specific scene context, which can be
formulated as follows:

Qs = MLP([t1, t2, · · · , tTs]),
Qs = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qs, K = Fs, V = Fs),
Qs = BiMamba(Qs).
(2)

Specifically, cross-attention is first applied to enable state queries to interact with the scene context,
followed by a Mamba block to model sequence relationships with linear-time complexity. Simultane-
ously, to account for the influences of rear state queries on the front ones, we adopt the bidirectional
Mamba [35, 80] for both forward and backward scanning. Additionally, a simple MLP module is
utilized to decode the state queries Qs into a single future trajectory for explicit supervision of time
consistency.

---Page Break---
Directional intention localization.
Mode queries Qm ∈RNaoi×K×C represent different motion
modes, with each query responsible for decoding one of the K trajectories. We utilize the Mode
Localization Module to localize the potential directional intentions, as shown below:

Qm = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qm, K = Fs, V = Fs),
Qm = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qm, K = Qm, V = Qm).
(3)

For spatial motion learning, two Multi-Head Attention blocks are employed to enable interactions
among mode queries and with the scene context. Additionally, we also employ simple MLPs to
decode the future trajectories and probabilities. Similarly, we introduce another auxiliary supervision
to endow mode queries with distinct motion intentions.

Hybrid query coupling.
To incorporate dynamic states and directional intentions, we simply add
Qm and Qs together to form the hybrid spatiotemporal queries Qh ∈RNaoi×K×Ts×C. Then, the
Hybrid Coupling Module is utilized to further process Qh and yield a comprehensive representation
for future trajectories, as formulated below:

Qh = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Fs, V = Fs),
Qh = HybridMultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Qh, V = Qh),
Qh = ModeMultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Qh, V = Qh),
Qh = BiMamba(Qh).

(4)

Besides the Attention and Mamba modules for interaction with the scene context, among modes, and
across time states, we additionally introduce a hybrid self-attention layer, which connects queries
across both time and modes, boosting the diversity of predicted trajectories. The change in feature
dimensions in this module is shown in Figure 2. The final predictions are generated by decoding the
output Qh into trajectory positions and probabilities with MLPs.

3.4
Training losses

DeMo is trained with three component losses in an end-to-end manner. Primarily, the regression loss
Lreg and the classification loss Lcls are employed to supervise the accuracy of predicted trajectories
and their associated probability scores. Additionally, we introduce two auxiliary losses, Lts and Lm,
for intermediate features of time states and motion modes, respectively. The former enhances the
coherence and causality of dynamic states across various time steps, while the latter endows mode
with distinct directional intentions. The overall loss L is a combination of these individual losses
with equal weights, formulated as follows:

L = Lreg + Lcls + Lts + Lm.
(5)

We adopt the cross-entropy loss for probability score classification and the smooth-L1 loss for
trajectory regression tasks. The winner-take-all strategy is employed, optimizing only the best
prediction with minimal average prediction error to the ground truth.

Evaluation metrics.
We adopt the common metrics: minADE, minFDE, MR, and b-minFDE.
For multi-agent scenarios, we use avgMinADE, avgMinFDE, and actorMR. The Argoverse 2
dataset is evaluated across six prediction modes, while nuScenes is evaluated across ten prediction
modes. We typically follow the evaluation metrics from the official leaderboard, setting K to 1 and 6
for the Argoverse 2 dataset, and K to 5 and 10 for the nuScenes dataset.

Implementation details.
Our models are trained for 60 epochs using the AdamW [42] optimizer,
with a batch size of 16 per GPU. The training is conducted end-to-end with a learning rate of 0.003
and a weight decay of 0.01. We adopt an agent-centric coordinate system and sample scene elements
within a 150-meter radius of the agents of interest. All experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA
GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. Additional details and further experiments are provided in Appendix A
and Appendix B.

4.2
Comparison with state of the art

We first compare our method, DeMo with several models on the Argoverse 2 [67] motion forecasting
benchmark for the single-agent setting as demonstrated in Table 1. To ensure a comprehensive and
fair comparison, we separately evaluate the performance of different methods with and without the
model ensembling technique. It is shown that DeMo has significantly outperformed all previous
approaches, including the state-of-the-art model QCNet [77] and its post-refinement enhancement
SmartRefine [76]. Concretely, our method distinctly surpasses other methods across all metrics, par-
ticularly in terms of minFDE1 and minADE1, where it demonstrates performance improvements
of 13.02% and 11.83% relative to QCNet, respectively. After using ensembling techniques similar to
other entries, DeMo surpasses all methods on all metrics by a large margin. Then, we compare the
performance of DeMo on the nuScenes [3] motion forecasting benchmark, with the results of the test
split presented in Table 2. Our method is also superior to others over all metrics except minADE5.

Multi-agent quantitative results

In multi-agent environments, it is essential for predictors to simultaneously forecast the future paths
of all relevant agents to comprehensively understand the driving situation. To validate the efficacy
of our model, DeMo, we conduct tests on the Argoverse 2 multi-agent dataset [67]. The results,
presented in Table 3, show that despite lacking the specialized multi-agent forecasting features found
in models such as [44, 55, 78], our model surpasses recent advancements across all evaluated metrics
due to our novel designs.

Ablation study

Effects of components.
Table 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of each component in our method.
We show the baseline in the first row, which is similar to previous methods [54, 77] and utilizes
mode queries to generate multi-modal future trajectories. Then, we directly adopt state queries in
the second row (ID-2) to decode the trajectories. A performance decline is observed due to the
surplus queries, which impose a burden on the model and make it difficult to distinguish the meanings
of different types. In the third row (ID-3), we introduce two auxiliary losses, resulting in a slight
improvement compared to the first row. Although the model can identify what each query represents,
it demonstrates only moderate performance due to the limited information. In the fourth row (ID-4),
we incorporate the three aggregation modules in Figure 2 but remove auxiliary losses, leading to
significant performance enhancements. Finally, in the fifth row (ID-5), our DeMo integrates all these
techniques and achieves outstanding performance.

Effects of state sequence modeling with Mamba.
Mamba excels at sequence modeling, so we
utilize Bidirectional Mamba [35, 80] to enhance the consistency of states across different time steps.
To demonstrate its effectiveness, we compare Bidirectional Mamba with several other modules,
including Unidirectional Mamba [24], Attention, Conv1d, and GRU [10]. As illustrated in the left
part of Table 5, our Bidirectional Mamba configuration outperforms the others due to its specialized
design for sequence modeling, compared to Attention, and its capability to perform both forward and
backward scans, unlike Unidirectional Mamba.

Effects of auxiliary losses and aggregation modules.
We conduct an ablation study to assess
the impacts of auxiliary losses and aggregation modules. As illustrated in the right part of Table 5,
removing any of these losses or modules leads to a performance decline in the model. Notably,
the aggregation modules have a greater impact than the auxiliary losses. This is attributed to the
critical role of learning information from the scene context and from each other, which is essential
for decoupling queries to represent distinct meanings.

Effects of state queries.
We conduct an ablation study on the number of state queries, as shown in
the left part of Table 6. In our default setting, we use 60 state queries to represent the future states
at 60 timestamps. As we gradually reduce the number of state queries, we observe a performance
decline due to the increasing ambiguity of the state query meanings.

Effects of the depth of Attention and Mamba blocks.
A suitable depth configuration of Attention
and Mamba units is crucial for achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. As
depicted in the right part of Table 6, we conduct an ablation study focusing on the layer depth. It is
observed that the best results are obtained with Attention units at a depth of three and Mamba units at
a depth of two.

Effects of the depth of Mamba blocks in the encoder.
We add ablation studies on the Mamba for
encoding agent historical information in the encoder of our DeMo. As shown in Table 7, the left part
shows different modules for encoding the historical information of agents. Our goal is to aggregate
historical information up to the present time, making Unidirectional Mamba the most suitable choice.

An analysis to improve the measurement of query decoupling

We measure the outputs of state queries and mode queries with minADE and minFDE, as shown
in Table 8. We can see that the minADE1 and minFDE1 of the trajectories from state query
outputs are better than those from mode query outputs. This means state dynamics are encoded
in state queries. Additionally, there are six output trajectories from mode queries, indicating that
directional information is predominantly stored in mode queries. The final outputs take advantage of
the strengths of both.

Efficiency analysis and qualitative results

Balancing performance, inference speed, and model size is important for the model deployment.
We compare our DeMo with two recent, representative models: the state-of-the-art QCNet [77]
and its enhancement through post-refinement, SmartRefine [76]. The size of our model is 5.9M,
in contrast to 7.7M for QCNet and 8.0M for SmartRefine. Despite its smaller size, our model
demonstrates superior performance by a significant margin, as detailed in Table 1. As for inference
speed, we compare DeMo with QCNet, both end-to-end methods. Measurements are conducted
on the Argoverse 2 single-agent validation set using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, with
a maintained batch size of one. The average inference speed of DeMo is only 38ms, which is
approximately 2.5 times faster than QCNet’s 94ms. This demonstrates that our method is not only
superior to QCNet but also more efficient.

In Figure 3, we present qualitative results of our network. The results of the baseline model, which
lacks the decoupled query paradigm, are shown in panel (a), while the results of our DeMo are
shown in panel (b). From the first two rows, it is evident that by explicitly optimizing the dynamic
states of future trajectories, our model predicts trajectories that are more accurate and closer to the
ground truth. From the third row, it is apparent that our model can better capture potential directional
intentions. Additional qualitative results and failure cases are detailed in Appendix D and E.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce DeMo, which redefines the motion forecasting task by decoupling it
into expressions of directional intentions and dynamic states. We utilize state queries to model
various states across different time, and mode queries to capture the agent’s motion intentions. Our
approach incorporates three aggregation modules, combining Attention and Mamba for effective
modeling. Comprehensive experiments, covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, indi-
cate that DeMo outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its potential as a
promising approach for achieving safe and reliable motion forecasting in the rapidly advancing field
of autonomous driving.

Limitations and future work.
The proposed framework adopts a decoupled query paradigm, which
may lead to heavier models due to the need to predict longer trajectories. Our current model design
does not sufficiently take model efficiency into account. In the future, we plan to use sparse states for
modeling trajectories, thereby making the framework more deployment-friendly.

Appendix

A
Experimental settings

A.1
Baseline model

Based on the streaming nature of driving data, our baseline model employs a lightweight transformer-
based architecture capable of historical prediction [45, 59]. This model predicts future trajectories
at intervals of 3s, 4s, and 5s for the Argoverse 2 dataset, and at 1s, 1.5s, and 2s for the Argoverse 1
dataset. The final prediction is the ultimate outcome of these trajectories. Features from the encoder
and decoder in the historical prediction phase are aggregated with those from the encoder and decoder
in the subsequent prediction phase. The aggregation module comprises two cross-attention layers.
The historical prediction component is not used for the nuScenes dataset due to the limited history
steps. In ablation studies, we remove the historical prediction component from the baseline model to
make the experiments more efficient.

A.2
Single-agent evaluation metrics

We employ established metrics to evaluate our models, including minimum Average Displacement
Error (minADEk), minimum Final Displacement Error (minFDEk), Miss Rate (MRk), and
Brier minimum Final Displacement Error (b-minFDEk). The minADEk metric calculates the
L2 distance between the ground-truth trajectory and the best K predicted trajectories, averaged
over all future time steps. The minFDEk metric measures the discrepancy between the endpoints
of the predicted trajectories and the ground truth. The MRk metric represents the proportion of
scenes where minFDEk exceeds 2 meters. To provide a more nuanced evaluation of uncertainty,
b-minFDEk incorporates (1−π)2 into the final displacement error, where π indicates the probability
score assigned by the model to the best-predicted trajectory.

A.3
Multi-agent evaluation metrics

Following the official settings for the Argoverse 2 multi-agent test set, we use metrics like Average
Minimum Final Displacement Error (avgMinFDE), Average Minimum Average Displacement
Error (avgMinADE), and Actor Miss Rate (actorMR). The avgMinFDE metric calculates the
average of the lowest Final Displacement Errors (FDEs) for all scored actors in a scenario, reflecting
prediction accuracy. Similarly, avgMinADE is the average of the lowest Average Displacement
Errors (ADEs) for all scored actors, showing overall movement accuracy. The actorMR measures
the proportion of actors missed across the evaluation set, as previously described.

A.4
More implementation details

In addition to the details in Section 4.1, we set the dropout rates at 0.2 for single-agent settings and
0.1 for multi-agent settings. We employ a cosine learning rate schedule with a warm-up phase of
10 epochs. For normalization, we use nn.LayerNorm, and for activation, we use nn.GELU. No data
augmentation techniques are used. For details on the number of layers in each component, please
refer to Table 10.

A.5
A precise formulation of the auxiliary losses

We use an MLP to decode state queries into a single future trajectory Yf and calculate the loss with
ground truth Ygt to obtain Lts:

Lts = SmoothL1(Yf, Ygt).
(6)

We use MLPs to decode the future trajectories Yf and probabilities Pf. So Lm is shown below:

Ybest, Pbest = SelectBest(Yf, Ygt),
Lm = SmoothL1(Ybest, Ygt) + CrossEntropy(Pf, Pbest).

predicted future trajectories for each agent. We then apply k-means clustering with six cluster centers
to process these trajectories. For each cluster group, we compute the average trajectory within the
group to determine the final trajectories. We present the results, both with and without the model
ensembling technique, on the Argoverse 2 single-agent test set in Table 1.

Mamba introduction

Mamba is inspired by a continuous system that maps a 1-D function or sequence x(t) ∈R to
y(t) ∈R, utilizing a hidden state h(t) ∈RN. In this system, A ∈RN×N serves as the evolution
parameter, while B ∈RN×1 and C ∈R1×N act as the projection parameters.

h′(t) = Ah(t) + Bx(t),
y(t) = Ch(t).
(8)

Mamba represents the discrete version of a continuous system and includes a timescale parameter
∆to convert the continuous parameters A and B into discrete counterparts A and B. The most
commonly used method for this transformation is zero-order hold (ZOH). After discretizing A and
B, the discretized form of Equation (8) using a step size of ∆can be reformulated as:

16


---Page Break---
A = exp (∆A),

B = (∆A)−1(exp (∆A) −I) · ∆B.

ht = Aht−1 + Bxt,
yt = Cht.

(9)

Finally, the models compute the output through a global convolution that utilizes a structured
convolutional kernel K ∈RM, where M represents the length of the input sequence x.

K = (CB, CAB, . . . , CA
M−1B),

y = x ∗K,

More qualitative results

We provide more qualitative results of our DeMo in Figure 5.

E
Failure cases

Although our DeMo has demonstrated exceptional performance on motion forecasting benchmarks,
it is not without its failures. We analyze these typical cases and present qualitative results to give
readers insight into the scenarios where our model might underperform. This analysis is intended to
support future efforts in developing an algorithm that is both more robust and powerful, as illustrated
in Figure 4. In the first row, the vehicle will turn into an alley, reflecting a kind of subjective driving
behavior. However, the model predicts that the vehicle will just keep going straight. To improve
predictions in cases like this, we could enhance how the model interacts with additional information
about what the vehicle intends to do, such as adding visual cues, such as turn signals. In the second
row, the agent needs to navigate through a complex intersection to reach one of the roads; however,
the model fails to accurately predict this driving behavior. This inaccuracy may be caused by a lack
of comprehensive understanding of the complex map topology and the unbalanced distribution of
driving data, addressing the issue of data balance is necessary to solve this problem.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The details of the model and experiments are provided in the main paper and
the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

22


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our main idea is specifically designed for applications in real-world au-
tonomous driving.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

23


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
