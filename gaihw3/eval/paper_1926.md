Abstract

This paper studies consensus conditions for leaderless and leader-follower matrix-
1

weighted consensus networks under the presence of constant time-delays. Several
2

delayed consensus algorithms for networks of single- and double-integrators using
3

only the relative positions are considered. Conditions for the networks to asymp-
4

totically converge to a consensus or clustering configuration are derived based on
5

direct eigenvalue evaluation or the Lyapunov-Krasovkii theorem. Furthermore,
6

an application of these algorithms in bearing-based network localization is also
7

considered. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.

Introduction
9

Recently, matrix-weighted consensus, a multi-dimensional extension of the well-known scalar-
10

weighted consensus algorithm [20], has received a considerable amount of research attention. A
11

matrix-weighted consensus system models diffusion dynamics in a multi-layer system with intra-
12

and cross-layer interactions between multiple subsystems (or agents). Several applications of matrix-
13

weighted consensus systems include multi-dimensional opinion dynamics models in [1,33], bearing-
14

based formation control [7,37], distributed localization of wireless sensor networks [3,4], and network
15

synchronization [31].
16

A matrix-weighted consensus network can be described by a graph with both positive definite and
17

positive semidefinite matrix weights. Associated with the graph, a corresponding Laplacian matrix,
18

whose the kernel (aka the nullspace) may contain further subspaces in addition to the consensus
19

space [2,12,31], can be defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix-weighted consensus
20

network to asymptotically achieve consensus or clustering were given in [29,30]. Discrete-time and
21

randomized matrix-weighted consensus were studied in [14,16,28]. The authors in [22] investigated
22

the continuous-time consensus protocol with switching matrix-weighted graphs. A consensus is
23

asymptotically achieved if the weighted integral network over some fixed time period always contains
24

a positive spanning tree, or equivalently, the kernel of the Laplacian matrix of the integrated network
25

contains only the consensus space [22]. The works [15, 16] examined the consensus problems
26

over matrix-weighted networks for double-integrator agents. Controllability of the matrix-weighted
27

consensus network was discussed in [21]. Recent studies on bipartite and multi-partite matrix-
28

weighted consensus have been proposed in [10,17,32].
29

It practice, time delays are unavoidable if agents communicate their state variables via a wireless
30

network, especially when the agents are separated by significant distances. When restricted to linear
31

systems, time delay yields phase lags and alters both the transient and steady-state responses of
32

the system. If the magnitude of the time delay is sufficiently large, the whole system could be
33

destabilized. For this reason, it is essential to examine the stability conditions of matrix-weighted
34

consensus networks under different assumptions on the time delays. It is noteworthy that even
35

with delayed linear differential equations, the exact analysis via characteristic equations will lead to

transcendental equations, of which solutions are often complicated [5,23]. An alternative approach
37

for analysing the stability of time-delayed systems is based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii or Lyapunov-
38

Razumikhin theorems [11,13]. In the literature, a sufficient condition for reaching a consensus in
39

a scalar consensus network with a uniform time delay was given in [20]. Lyapunov-Razumikhin
40

type functional was used for finding sufficient conditions for consensus networks with heterogeneous
41

edge delays and switching interaction topology in [27]. The authors in [25] studied the consensus
42

problem with uniform delay communication and provided consensus conditions by considering
43

some Lyapunov–Razumikhin functionals. The author in [24] considered a consensus problem with
44

heterogeneous communication time delays and introduced a delayed weighted Laplacian for the
45

analysis. The consensus of double-integrator agents with time delay was studied in [34] based on
46

an approximated characteristic equation under the assumption that the delays are sufficiently small.
47

An exact analytic method for a second-order delayed scalar-consensus protocol was proposed in [6].
48

Stabilization control laws for double- and chain of integrators using delays were proposed in [19],
49

and in the consensus problem over a scalar-weighted graph [26].
50

In this paper, we derive stability conditions of several delayed matrix-weighted consensus models
51

having either a leaderless or a leader-follower topology. A leader-follower network contains several
52

leader agents acting as stationary references during the dynamic process. First, we consider a
53

matrix-weighted consensus network where all the edges have the same constant time delay. For this
54

network, a necessary and sufficient stability condition related to the magnitude of the time delay
55

and the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is established. Second, we study the
56

matrix-weighted consensus with multiple heterogeneous constant time delays. A stability condition
57

is given in terms of the feasibility of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Third, we consider a matrix-
58

weighted consensus network of double integrators, and show that the network can asymptotically
59

reach the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian by using only the delayed relative positions. As
60

it is assumed that the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is not restricted to the consensus
61

space, the applicability of the considered models is beyond a consensus problem. In particular, an
62

application of the theoretical results in bearing-based network localization [36] is also discussed.
63

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical background is provided
64

and three delayed matrix-weighted consensus models studied in this paper are presented. Sections
65

3–5 give stability conditions and detailed analysis of each consensus model. An application in
66

bearing-based network localization is discussed in Section 6, and simulation results are provided in
67

Appendix A.5 to support the analysis. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper.

Preliminaries

2.1
Matrix-weighted networks
77

Consider an undirected, matrix-weighted graph G = (V, E, A) with the vertex set V = {1, . . . , n},
78

the edge set E ⊆V × V of m = |E| edges, and the set of nonnegative definite matrix weights
79

A = {Aij ∈Rd×d}i,j∈V with Aij = A⊤
ij ≥0, ∀i, j and d ≥2. Each edge (i, j) ∈E captures the
80

interactions between two agents i and j, and the existence of (i, j) implies the existence of (j, i)
81

since the graph is undirected. If (i, j) ∈E, then Aij ̸= 0; and if (i, j) /∈E or i = j, then Aij = Θd.
82

The neighbor set of a vertex i ∈V is denoted as Ni = {j ∈V| (i, j) ∈E}. Then, the degree matrix
83

of a vertex i is defined as Di = P

j∈Ni Aij.
84

Now, we can define matrix-weighted- adjacency and degree matrices A = [Aij] ∈Rdn×dn and
85

D = blkdiag(D1, . . . , Dn) ∈Rdn×dn. A matrix weighted Laplacian L = [Lij] ∈Rdn×dn has

Pn
j=1 Aij,
if i = j.
(1)

Note that L is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and ker(L) ⊇im(1n ⊗Id). A matrix-weighted
88

graph and its corresponding matrix-weighted Laplacian is depicted in Fig. 1 as an example.
89

We order the edges in E such that E = {e1, . . . , em}, and adopt the notation Aij ≡Ak, ∀ek =
90

(i, j, k = 1, . . . , m). For each edge (i, j), we specify a vertex to be the starting vertex and the other
91

vertex as the end vertex. The incidence matrix H = [hki] ∈Rm×n is defined as follows
92

hki =






−1,
if i is the starting vertex of ek,
+1,
if i is the end vertex of ek,
0,
otherwise.
(2)

Then, L = ¯H⊤blkdiag(Ak) ¯H, where ¯H = H ⊗Id, and ‘⊗’ denotes the Kronecker product.
93

Suppose that the matrix-weighted Laplacian L has l ≥d eigenvalues 0 with l linearly independent
94

eigenvectors v1, . . . , vl. This assumption allows the possibilities of achieving a consensus or and
95

clustering when the following consensus algorithm is performed on a matrix-weighted network of
96

single integrators
97

˙xi(t) =
X

j∈Ni
Aij(xj(t) −xi(t)), i = 1, . . . , n.

where xi ∈Rd is the state vector of agent i ∈V. Let x = [x⊤
1 , . . . , x⊤
n ]⊤∈Rdn, the matrix-
98

weighted consensus algorithm (3) can be rewritten in matrix form as
99

˙x(t) = −Lx(t),

and it has been shown that x(t) →¯x = 1

i=1 xi(0) ∈ker(L), as t →+∞[18,29]. Throughout
100

the paper, the shorthand xij(t) = xj(t) −xi(t) will be used.
101

From the assumption that zero is a semi-simple eigenvalue of multiplicity l ≥d, and L is symmetric,
102

positive semi-definite, there exists an orthonormal matrix P = [p1, . . . , pdn] = [R, Q] ∈Rdn×dn
103

such that R = [p1, . . . , pl] ∈Rdn×l, Q = [pl+1, . . . , pdn] ∈Rdn×(dn−l),

spectively) the diagonal matrix containing all eigenvalues (all positive eigenvalues) of L. Note that
107

R ⊇im(1n ⊗Id) since the kernel of a matrix-weighted Laplacian always contains the consensus
108

space. Also, Q⊤R = 0(dn−l)×l, Q⊤Q = Idn−l.
109

Consider a partition of the vertex set into two disjoint subsets Va and Vb such that Va ∪Vb = V,
110

Va ∩Vb = ∅, |Va| = na, |Vb| = nb, na + nb = n. The agents associated with the vertices in
111

Va and Vb are referred to as leaders and followers, respectively. By labeling the vertices such that
112

Va = {1, . . . , na}, Vb = {na + 1, . . . , n}, the matrix-weighted Laplacian is partitioned as

,
(5)

where La = L⊤
a ∈Rdna×dna, L⊤
ab ∈Rdna×dnb, and Lb = L⊤
b ∈Rdnb×dnb. Let L′ denote the
114

matrix-weighted Laplacian corresponding to the subgraph induced by the vertices in Vb and edges in
115

G. If na = 0, we have a leaderless network while for na ≥1, we have a leader-follower network. We
116

prove the following lemma on the matrix-weighted Laplacian (5).
117

Lemma 2.1. Let rank(L) = dn −l, rank(L′) = dnb −l, na ≥1 and l ≥d + 1. If ∀ξ ∈ker(L′),
118

[0⊤
dna, ξ⊤]⊤/∈ker(L), then the matrix Lb is symmetric positive definite.
119

Proof. Let B = blkdiag(Lab(1na ⊗Id)) = blkdiag(B1, . . . , Bnb) ∈Rdnb×dnb, we have Lb =
120

L′ −B. Suppose that Lb is not positive definite, then there exists ξ = [ξ⊤
1 , . . . , ξ⊤
nb]⊤∈Rdnb
121

such that ξ⊤Lbξ = ξ⊤(L′ −B)ξ = 0dnb. From the assumption on L′, it follows that ξ ∈ker(L′).
122

Furthermore, ξ⊤Bξ = Pnb
k=1 ξ⊤
k Bkξk = 0. Since each matrix weight in Bk = Pna
j=1[Lab]kj is
123

negative semidefinite, it follows that ξk ∈ker([Lab]kj), ∀j = 1, . . . , na, or equivalently L⊤
abξ =

0dna. Then, we have L

= 0dn, which shows that [0⊤

125

contradiction implies that Lb must be positive definite.
126

2.2
Problem formulation
127

This paper aims to give some conditions for stability and/or reaching a consensus when time delays
128

are present in (4) and its expanded versions. Particularly, the following matrix-weighted consensus
129

models with time delays will be studied.
130

Model 1 Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform constant time-delay τ > 0:
131

˙xi(t) =
X

j∈Ni
Aijxij(t −τ),
(6)

∀i ∈Vb, and ˙xi(t) = 0d, ∀i ∈Va.
132

Model 2 Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with heterogeneous constant time-delays
133

˙xi(t) =

n
X

j=1
xij(t −τij),
(7)

where i ∈Vb, τij ≥0 is the time-delay associated with an edge (i, j) ∈E, and ˙xi(t) = 0d, ∀i ∈Va.
134

Model 3 Matrix-weighted consensus of double-integrators with two constant time-delays:
135

˙x1
i (t) = x2
i (t),
(8a)

˙x2
i (t) = −
X

j∈Ni

i (t −τ1) −x1
j(t −τ1)) −α
X

j∈Ni
Aij(x1
i (t −τ2) −x1
j(t −τ2)),
(8b)

where xk
i = [xk
1i, . . . , xk
di]⊤∈Rd, i ∈Vb, and ˙xk
i (t) = 0d, ∀i ∈Va, k = 1, 2. Here, xi =
136

[(x1
i )⊤, (x2
i )⊤]⊤and x1
1, x2
i are referred to as the position and the velocity of agent i, and α > 0 is a
137

control gain.
138

For each model, the initial condition is given as x(θ) = x(0), ∀θ ∈[−τk, 0].

Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform time-delay
140

In this section, we give condition on the time-delay to ensure the model (6) to asymptotically achieve
141

a consensus for leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted networks.

3.1
Leaderless network
143

The following theorem provides necessary and sufficient consensus condition for a leaderless matrix-
144

weighted consensus network.
145

Theorem 3.1. Consider a leaderless n-agent network with Va = ∅, and rank(L) = dn −l, l ≥d.
146

Under the consensus algorithm (6), x(t) asymptotically converges to x∗= RR⊤x(0) ∈ker(L) if
147

and only if τ <
π
2λdn , where λdn is the largest eigenvalue of L.
148

Proof. The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.2.
149

Remark 3.2. Observe that if rank(L) = dn −d and the stability condition τ <
π
2λdn holds, then
150

l = d, Pd
p=1 pkp⊤
k =
1
n(1n1⊤
n ⊗Id) and the system asymptotically achieves a consensus. A
151

similar consensus condition was given in [20] for scalar-weighted consensus networks but the proof
152

is different from that of Theorem 3.1.
153

3.2
Leader-follower network
154

Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus law (6). Let xa = [x⊤
1 , . . . , x⊤
na]⊤
155

and xb = [x⊤
na+1, . . . , x⊤
n ]⊤respectively denote the stacked vectors of the leader and the follower
156

agents. The behaviors of the network is given in the following theorem.
157

Theorem 3.3. Consider a leader-follower n-agent network with na ≥1, rank(L) = dn −l, l ≥d,
158

and Lb is positive definite. Under the consensus algorithm (6), xb asymptotically converges to
159

x∗
b = L−1
b Labxa if and only if τ <
π
2λb max , where λb max is the largest eigenvalue of Lb.
160

Proof. We can write the n-agent network in matrix form as follows
161


˙xa(t)
˙xb(t)


= −

Θdna
0dna×dnb
Lab
Lb

 
xa(t −τ)
xb(t −τ)


.
(9)

As xa(t) = xa(0), ∀t ≥−τ, we consider the variable transformation δb(t) = xb(t) + L−1
b Labxa,
162

and derive the equation
163

˙δb(t) = −Lbδb(t −τ).
(10)

The proof that the delayed system (10) is asymptotically stable if and only if τ <
π
2λb max is similar to
164

the proof of Thm. 3.1 and will be omitted.
165

Remark 3.4. It is remarked that if a consensus algorithm is performed in a leader-follower scalar-
166

weighted graph with non-collocated leaders, the followers will asymptotically converge to fixed
167

points inside the convex hull of the leaders’ position. In contrast, as shown in Thm. 3.3, for a
168

matrix-weighted consensus, the convergence points of follower agents may lie outside the convex hull
169

of the leaders’ positions. This property finds application in the bearing-based network localization
170

problem discussed in Section 6.
171

Matrix-weighted consensus of single integrators with heterogeneous delays
172

In this section, we study the matrix-weighted consensus algorithms with heterogeneous time delays
173

(7). We first study the problem for a leaderless matrix-weighted network and then consider the
174

problem for a leader-follower network.
175

4.1
Leaderless network
176

Due to symmetry, we have τij = τji, ∀(i, j) ∈E. We can rewrite the dynamics (7) in the matrix form
177

as follows:
178

˙x(t) = −

r
X

k=1
Lkx(t −τk),
(11)

5

where r ≤|E|, τk = τij if ek = (i, j), for k = 1, . . . , r, and Lk = [Lkij] ∈Rdn×dn is a matrix
179

whose d × d blocks are defined by
180

Lkij =






−Aij,
j ̸= i, τk = τij,
Θd,
j ̸= i, τk ̸= τij,
−Pn
j=1,j̸=i Lkij,
j = i.

It is observed that Lk is a part of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to an update with time delay
181

τk, and L = Pr
k=1 Lk. As in the previous section, R⊤Lk = 0l×nd, for k = 1, . . . , r. It follows that
182

x∗= RR⊤x(t) is time-invariant.
183

Moreover, we have Lk = PΛkP⊤, where Λk =

R(dn−l)×(dn−l). Define δ(t) = Q⊤x(t) ∈Rdn−l, then the equation (11) can be rewritten in the
185

following form [13]:

The stability of the system (12) is stated in the following theorem, whose proof can be found in
187

Appendix A.3.
188

Theorem 4.1. Consider the leaderless matrix-weighted consensus network with time delays (12),
189

where rank(L) = dn −l, na = 0 and l ≥d. Suppose that the time delays τk are sufficient small such
190

that the LMI (13) holds, where τ = Pr
i=1 τi.1 Then, the origin is a globally uniformly asymptotically
191

equilibrium of (12) and x(t) →x∗∈ker(L) as t →+∞.

Leader-follower network
193

Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus algorithm (7). Similar to
194

the previous section, we can define δb(t) = xb(t) + L−1
b Labxa, where Lab = Pr
k=1 Labk and
195

Lb = Pr
k=1 Lbbk. That is, each matrix Lk contributes a part to the matrices Lab and Lb. Then,

(14)

We can now state a theorem on the delayed-system (14), whose proof is similar to the proof of
197

Theorem 4.1 and will be omitted.
198

Theorem 4.2. Suppose that the n-agent network has a leader follower structure, na ≥1, rank(L) =
199

dn −l, l ≥d, and Lb is positive definite. If the time delays τk are chosen such that the LMI
200

(15) holds and τ = Pr
i=1 τi, then δb = 0dnb is globally unniformly asymptotically stable, and
201

x(t) →L−1
b Labxa as t →+∞.
202

1In each LMI, the asterisk ‘*’ indicates that the matrix is symmetric, so it is no need to specify the block
matrices below the diagonal.

Leaderless network

Consider a leaderless matrix-weighted network. We express the network (8) in the matrix form as

n ⊗Id)Lx1(t −τ1) + α(1⊤
n ⊗Id)Lx1(t −τ2) = 0dn.
208

Hence, (1⊤
n ⊗Id)x2(t) = (1⊤
n ⊗Id)x2(0) = 0dn. This property will be used in proving the main
209

theorem of this subsection.

matrix L. Thus, for α < 1 and τ2 > 0, F(τ2) is Hurwitz, and we can find a symmetric positive

Remark 5.2. The condition α < 1 is only sufficient for our analysis, which is based on (16) to

228

229

5.2
Leader-follower network
230

We now consider the consensus algorithm (8) when the matrix-weighted graph has a leader-follower
231

structure. The leaders’ positions are time-invariant, thus x1
a(t) = x1
a(0) := x1
a, x2
a(t) = 0dna, ∀t ≥
232

b(t) = −Lbx1

(19b)

Using the variable transformation δ1
b(t) = x1
b(t) + L−1
b Labx1 and δ2
b(t) = x2
b(t), we have the
234

equations with the transformed variables
235

˙δ1
b(t) = δ2

236

there exists a symmetric positive definite matrix Πb satisfying the following equation
237

ΠbE(τ2) + E(τ2)⊤Πb = −τI2dnb,

Bearing-based network localization under time delays
244

We consider a wireless sensor network of n nodes in the d ≥2 dimensional space. Consider a global
245

coordinate system gΣ, and let the position of the i-th sensor in the network referred in gΣ be denoted
246

as xi ∈Rd.
247

The network is characterized by (G, x), where G is the interaction graph and x = [x⊤
1 , . . . , x⊤
n ]⊤∈
248

Rdn, the stacked vector of the global positions of n nodes, is referred to as a realization. Each node
249

(or agent), located at xi ∈Rd, can measure the bearing vector gij =
xj−xi
∥xj−xi∥, which contains the
250

directional information from node i to a neighboring node j ∈Ni. The global position xi is unknown
251

to each agent i, so it needs to update an estimate ˆxi(t) ∈Rd of xi and exchange this information
252

with its neighbors. The process of determining the positions of the network’s nodes is called network
253

localization. We assume that the information about the origin of the global coordinate system is
254

unavailable to each agent and each agent maintains a local coordinate systems iΣ, whose axes are
255

aligned with gΣ. This assumption is feasible since we can firstly conduct an orientation alignment
256

algorithm before performing the network localization process.
257

For each bearing vector gij, there is a corresponding symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Pgij =
258

Id −gijg⊤
ij ∈Rd×d satisfying ker(Pgij) = im(gij) and Pgij = P⊤
gij = P2
gij. Observe that Pgij is
259

an orthogonal projection onto ker(gij). The bearing-based network localization algorithm [35,36]
260

˙ˆxi(t) = −
X

j∈Ni
Pgij(ˆxi(t) −ˆxj(t)), i = 1, . . . , n,
(22)

can be considered as a matrix-weighted consensus algorithm (3). The network localization algorithm
261

(22) induces the bearing Laplacian L with the ij-th off-diagonal block matrix −Pgij. It has been
262

shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the network under the update law (22) to be
263

determined up to a translation and a scaling is rank(L) = dn −d −1 [37]. Thus, the bearing
264

Laplacian corresponds to l = d + 1, and all theoretical results in Sections 3–5 are applicable for the
265

bearing-based network localization problem with time delays.
266

Conclusions
267

In this paper, three leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted consensus models with constant
268

time-delays were studied. The stability of the considered models was analysed and several conditions
269

for the system to asymptotically converge to a point in the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian
270

were provided. An application in bearing-based network localization with time-delays was also given.
271

Since the current work only focuses on constant time delay, for further studies, it will be interesting
272

to consider time-varying time-delays or adaptive algorithms for stabilizing the matrix-weighted
273

consensus network with time-delays.

A.1
Time-delay systems and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem
360

Consider the functional differential equation
361

˙x(t) = f(t, xt), t ≥t0,
(23a)
xt0(θ) = φ(θ), ∀θ ∈[−τ, 0],
(23b)

where x(t) ∈Rn, and the notation xt = x(t + θ), ∀θ ∈[−τ, 0] is adopted. The function f :
362

R × Cn,τ →Rn is continuous in both arguments and is locally Lipschitz in the second argument.2
363

Furthermore, it is assumed that f(t, 0n) = 0n, ∀t ∈R so that x ≡0n is a solution of the system.
364

2Cn,τ = C[−τ, 0] denotes the Banach space of absolutely continuous vector functions φ : [−τ, 0] →
Rn with ˙φ ∈L2(−τ, 0) (the space of square-integrable functions) equipped with the norm ∥φ∥C =

Lemma A.1 (Lyapunov-Krasovskii Theorem). [8] Suppose that f maps R× (bounded sets of Cn,τ)
365

into bounded sets of Rn, and there exist functions u, v, w :
R+ →R+ which are continuous,
366

nondecreasing functions, u(s) > 0, v(s) > 0, w(s) > 0, ∀s > 0, u(0) = v(0) = 0. If there exists a
367

continuous function V : R × Cn × L2(−h, 0) →R+, such that
368

(i) u(∥x∥) ≤V (t, xt, ˙xt) ≤v(∥xt∥C),
369

(ii) ˙V (t, xt, ˙xt) ≤−w(∥x∥),
370

then, the solution x(t) ≡0n is uniformly asymptotically stable. If in addition,
371

(iii) lims→+∞u(s) = +∞,
372

then the solution x(t) ≡0n is globally uniformly asymptotically stable.

A.2
Proof of Theorem 3.1
383

We rewrite the consensus system (6) in the following matrix form
384

˙x(t) = −Lx(t −τ).
(24)

Consider the variable transformation δ(t) = Q⊤x(t). By expressing L = PΛP⊤, we have
385

˙δ(t) = −¯Λδ(t −τ).
(25)

As R⊤˙x(t) = 0l, R⊤x(t), which shows that R⊤x(t) = R⊤x(0) = Pl
i=1 p⊤
i x(0) is time invariant.
386

The n-agent system (25) asymptotically converges to a point in ker(L) if and only if δ(t) →0dn−l,
387

as t →+∞, or all roots of the characteristic equation
388

det(sIdn + ¯Λe−τs) = 0
(26)

must have negative real parts. Equation (26) is equivalent to s + λke−τs = 0, ∀k = l + 1, . . . , dn.
389

Let s = σ + ȷω, where σ, ω ∈R, we have
390

σ + ȷω + λke−τ(σ+ȷω) = σ + ȷω + λke−τσ(cos(ωτ) −ȷ sin(ωτ))

= σ + λke−τσ cos(ωτ) + ȷ(ω −λke−τσ sin(ωτ)).

Thus, the roots of (26) satisfy σ = −λke−τσ cos(ωτ), ω = λke−τσ sin(ωτ).
391

(Necessity) If σ < 0, ∀ω, it follows that cos(ωτ) = cos(λkωe−τστ sin(τω)) > 0, ∀ω. This implies
392

that |λkτe−τσ sin(τω)| ≤λkτe−τσ < π

2 , ∀k = l + 1, . . . , dn, or τ < πeτσ

2λdn ≤
π
2λdn .
393

12


---Page Break---
(Sufficiency) if τ <
π
2λdn , because σ2 + ω2 = λ2
ke−2τσ, it follows that |ω| ≤λke−τσ, and
394

τ|ω| ≤
πe−τσ

2
. If σ ≥0, then e−τσ ≤1. It follows that cos(τω) ≥cos( π

2 ) ≥0, and σ =
395

−λke−τσ cos( π

2 ) ≤0. This contradiction implies that σ < 0.
396

Therefore, we conclude that σ < 0 if and only if τ <
π
2λdn .
397

Next, let the condition τ <
π
2λdn be satisfied, and x(t) = Φ(t), ∀t ∈[−τ, 0], and Φ(t) = x(0), the
398

from Eqs. (28) and (29), one gets
409

˙V (δ(t), ˙δt) ≤(y(t))⊤My(t),
(30)
where M is given in (13). From the assumption that M < 0, there exists γ > 0 such that
410

˙V (δ(t), ˙δt) ≤−γ∥δ(t)∥2.
(31)
or the origin is a globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium of the system (12) (Appendix
411

A.1). Thus, x(t) →x∗∈ker(L), as t →+∞.
412

The matrix M is a summation of two matrices, the first one is positive definite when τk are small,
413

and the second one can be made arbitrarily small by choosing τk small. This implies that the LMI
414

(13) is feasible if τk, k = 1, . . . , r, are sufficiently small.

Thus, if the LMI Ξ1 + τ 4

428

By Schur’s complement, this condition is equivalent to
429

Ξ(τ2) < 0.
(39)

Thus, ˙V (zt, ˙zt) ≤−c∥z∥2 for some c > 0, or equivalently, z = 0 is globally uniformly asymp-
430

totically stable (Appendix A.1) and xk(t) →ker(L), k = 1, 2, if the LMI (39) is satisfied. Since
431

x2

conclude that x2
i (t) →0d, ∀i = 1, . . . , n.
433

Finally, we consider the feasibility of the LMI (39). As F(τ2) is affinely dependent on τ2, let Π be a
434

solution of the Lyapunov equation (16), then Π does not have any term that is affine dependent on τ2,
435

i.e., Π = O(1). Let τ1 be selected such that τ1 = O(τ 2

436

F(τ2)⊤Π + ΠF(τ2) = −τI2dn−2l + O(τ 2

Choose R = τ −1

Matrix-weighted consensus models with time delays
441

In this subsection, we consider a matrix-weighted network of 10 agents in R3 with the interaction
442

graph as depicted in Fig. 4(a). The edge weights are selected so that rank(L) = 3n −3 = 27. We
443

will below simulate the network of 10 agents under different assumptions of the time-delays.

graph G and the true positions xi of 10-sensor network in Subsection 6.2.

444

The network has a uniform time-delay: We consider the consensus network with a uniform
445

constant delay. The maximum eigenvalue of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is calculated to be
446

10.9235, and thus, the upper bound of the delay is τmax ≈0.1438 (seconds). For τ = 0.1 < τmax,
447

Fig. 4(b) shows that the n-agent system asymptotically consents on a common vector. However, for
448

τ = 0.25 > τmax, simulation result in Fig. 4(c) shows that the consensus system becomes unstable.
449

The network has heterogeneous time delays: Next, let the matrix-weighted network has
450

heterogeneous edge time delays as given in Table 1. In Simulation 1, the time delays are τ1 = 0.05,
451

τ2 = 0.10, τ3 = 0.15. The system asymptotically achieves a consensus. As shown in Figs. 5(a),
452

heterogeneous delays cause significant fluctuations on the process of reaching an agreement.

For Simulation 2, the time delays are changed to τ1 = 0.05, τ2 = 0.10, τ3 = 0.20. In this case, the
454

system becomes unstable as shown in Fig. 5(c).
455

Consensus of double integrators without velocity measurements: We consider the same matrix
456

weighted graphs and conduct simulations for different values of the time delays τ1, τ2 and the control
457

gain k to demonstrate the continuous dependencies of the MWC algorithm (8) with regard to the
458

design parameters.
459

We first fix the time delays τ1 = 0.05, τ2 = 0.25 and vary the control gain k from 1.1 to 0.2. It can
460

be seen that if k = 1.1 (exceeding 1) and k = 0.2 (being too small so that the LMI does not hold),
461

the system becomes unstable (see Figs. 6(a)– (f)). For k = 0.3, 0.5, 0.85, 1, the agents
462

asymptotically achieve a consensus. It can be observed from Figs. 6(b)–6(e) that when k is smaller,
463

the interaction between agents becomes weaker and thus, more fluctuations are exhibited during the
464

process of reaching a consensus.
465

Second, we fix k = 0.85, τ1 = 0.05 (sec), and vary τ2. Simulation results corresponding to
466

τ2 = 0.25, 0.6, and 0.66 are shown in Figs. 6(c), (g), (h), respectively. Clearly, after τ2 exceeds the
467

limit (about 0.658 (sec)), the network becomes unstable.
468

Third, we fix k = 0.85, τ2 = 0.25 (sec), and vary τ1. Simulation results are depicted in Figs. 6 (a),
469

(c), (j)–(l), corresponding to τ1 = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.22, respectively. As τ1 gradually reaches to
470

τ2, the network tends to be less stable, and when τ2 = 0.22 (sec), the network becomes unstable.
471

Thus, simulation results are consistent with the analysis.

Bearing-based network localization with time delays
473

Below, we give simulations of the bearing-based network localization laws with time delays to
474

reinforce our analysis. Specifically, in all simulations in this subsection, a 10-agent network will be

476

that the bearing Laplacian satisfies rank(L) = 26.

Bearing-based network localization with uniform constant time delays: Consider the
478

bearing-based network localization (6) with a constant time delay. The simulation results are
479

depicted in Figs. 7(a)–(b) for τ = 0.1, and Figs. 7(c)–(d). For τ = 0.1, the estimate ˆx asymptotically
480

converges to an x∗, which differs from the correct position x by a translation and a scaling. For
481

τ = 0.2, after 20 seconds of simulation, it can be observed that ˆx tends to grow unbounded
482

(instability).

Bearing-based network localization with heterogeneous time-delays: Next, we simulate the
484

network localization algorithm (7) with parameters given in Table 2. For τ3 = 0.2 (sec), it is
485

observed from Figures 8(a)–(b) that ˆx converges to a configuration x∗, and the sum of squared
486

bearing errors P

(i,j)∈E ∥gij −g∗
ij∥2 asymptotically converges to zero. Thus, x∗is a configuration
