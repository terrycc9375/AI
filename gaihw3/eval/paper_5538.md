Abstract

We provide space complexity lower bounds for data structures that approximate
logistic loss up to ϵ-relative error on a logistic regression problem with data
X ∈Rn×d and labels y ∈{−1, 1}d. The space complexity of existing coreset
constructions depend on a natural complexity measure µy(X), first defined in [10].
We give an ˜Ω( d

ϵ2 ) space complexity lower bound in the regime µy(X) = O(1) that
shows existing coresets are optimal in this regime up to lower order factors. We
also prove a general ˜Ω(d · µy(X)) space lower bound when ϵ is constant, showing
that the dependency on µy(X) is not an artifact of mergeable coresets. Finally, we
refute a prior conjecture that µy(X) is hard to compute by providing an efficient
linear programming formulation, and we empirically compare our algorithm to
prior approximate methods.

Introduction

Logistic regression is an indispensable tool in data analysis, dating back to at least the early 19th
century. It was originally used to make predictions in social science and chemistry applications [14, 15,
3], but over the past 200 years it has been applied to all data-driven scientific domains, from economics
and the social sciences to physics, medicine, and biology. At a high level, the (binary) logistic
regression model is a statistical abstraction that models the probability of one of two alternatives or
classes by expressing the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the class as a linear combination of
one or more predictor variables.

Formally, logistic regression aims to find a parameter vector β ∈Rd that minimizes the logistic loss,
L(β), which is defined as follows:

L(β) =

n
X

i=1
log(1 + e−yixT
i β),
(1)

where X ∈Rn×d is the data matrix (n points in Rd, with xT
i being the rows of X) and y ∈{−1, 1}n
is the vector of labels whose entries are the yi. Due to the central importance of logistic regression,
algorithms and methods to improve the efficiency of minimizing the logistic loss are always of interest
[7, 10, 9].

The prior study of linear regression, a much simpler problem that admits a closed-form solution, has
provided ample guidance on how we may expect to improve the efficiency of logistic regression. Let

us first consider how a data structure that approximates ℓ2-regression loss may be leveraged to design
efficient algorithms for linear regression. Let D(·) : Rd →R be a data structure such that:

(1 −ϵ)∥Ax −b∥2 ≤D(x) ≤(1 + ϵ)∥Ax −b∥2.

Then, for, say, any ϵ ∈(0, 1/3)

˜x = argmin
x∈Rd D(x) ⇒∥A˜x −b∥2 ≤1 + ϵ

1 −ϵ · min
x∈Rd ∥Ax −b∥2

≤(1 + 3ϵ) · min
x∈Rd ∥Ax −b∥2.

That is, a data structure that approximates the ℓ2-regression loss up to ϵ-relative error may be used to
solve the original regression problem up to 3ϵ-relative error. This is particularly interesting when
D(·) has lower space complexity than the original problem or can be minimized more efficiently.

Practically efficient data structures satisfying these criteria for linear regression have been instantiated
through matrix sketching and leverage score sampling [16]. There is extensive work exploring
constructions of a matrix S ∈Rs×n, where given a data matrix A ∈Rn×d and vector of labels
b ∈Rn, we may solve the lower dimensional problem ˜x = argminx∈Rd ∥SAx −Sb∥2 to achieve
the guarantee ∥A˜x −b∥2 ≤1+ϵ

1−ϵ · minx∈Rd ∥Ax −b∥2 for a chosen ϵ > 0. Under conditions that
guarantee that s ≪n, we can achieve significant computational time and space savings by following
such an approach. An important class of matrices S ∈Rs×n that guarantee the above approximation
are the so-called ℓ2-subspace embeddings which satisfy:

(1 −ϵ)∥Ax −b∥2 ≤∥S(Ax −b)∥2 ≤(1 + ϵ)∥Ax −b∥2 for all x ∈Rd.

Despite the central importance of logistic regression in statistics and machine learning, relatively
little is known about how the method behaves when matrix sketching and sampling are applied to
its input. Munteanu et al. [10, 11] initiated the study of coresets for logistic regression. Meanwhile,
Munteanu and Omlor [9] provide the current state-of-the-art bounds bounds on the size of a coreset for
logistic regression. Analogously to linear regression, these works present an efficient data structure
˜L(·) such that

(1 −ϵ)L(β) ≤˜L(β) ≤(1 + ϵ)L(β).
(2)

We call ˜L(·) an ϵ-relative error approximation to the logistic loss. Prior work on coreset construction
for logistic regression critically depends on the data complexity measure µy(X), which was first
introduced in [10], and is defined as follows.
Definition 1. (Classification Complexity Measure [10]) For any X ∈Rn×d and y ∈{−1, 1}n, let

µy(X) = sup
β̸=0

∥(DyXβ)+∥1
∥(DyXβ)−∥1
,

where Dy is a diagonal matrix with y as its diagonal, and (DyXβ)+ and (DyXβ)−denote the
positive and the negative entries of DyXβ respectively.

Specifically, these methods construct a coreset by storing a subset of the rows indexed by S ⊂
{1 . . . n} such that |S| = ˜O( d·µy(X)

ϵ2
) and generating a set of weights {wi}i∈S such that each wi is
specified by O(log nd) bits [9]. The approximate logistic loss is then computed as:

˜L(β) =
X

i∈S
wi · log(1 + e−yixT
i β)
(3)

is an ϵ-relative error approximation to L(β). We see that µy(X) is important in determining how
compressible a logistic regression problem is through coresets, and prior has proven this dependency
in coresets is necessary [17]. Our work further shows this dependency is fundamental to the space
complexity of approximating logistic loss by any data structure.

Our work advances understanding of data structures that approximate logistic loss to reduce its space
and time complexity. Our results provide guidance on how existing coreset constructions may be
improved upon as well as their fundamental limitations.

Our contributions

We briefly summarize our contributions in this work; see Section 1.3 for notation.

• We prove that any data structure that approximates logistic loss up to ϵ-relative error must
use ˜Ω( d

ϵ2 ) space in the worst case on a dataset with constant µ-complexity (Theorem 1).
• We show that any coreset that provides an ϵ-relative error approximation to logistic loss
requires storing ˜Ω( d

ϵ2 ) rows of the original data matrix X (Corollary 2). Thereby, we prove
that analyses of existing coreset constructions are optimal up to logarithmic factors in the
regime where µy(X) = O(1).
• We prove that any data structure that approximates logistic loss to relative error must take
˜Ω(d · µy(X)) space, thereby showing that the dependency on the µ-complexity measure is
not an artifact of using mergeable coresets which the prior work [17] had relied on (Theorem
3).
• We provide experiments that demonstrate how prior methods that only approximate µy(X)
can be substantially inaccurate, despite being more complicated to implement than our
method (see Section 4).
• Finally, we prove that low rank approximations can provide a simple but weak additive error
approximation to logistic loss and these guarantees are tight in the worst case (See Appendix
D).

Related Work

Prior work has explored the space complexity of data structures that preserve ∥Xβ∥p for β ∈Rd,
particularly in the important case where p = 2. Lower bounds for this problem are analogous to
our work and motivate our inquiry. An early example of such work is [12], which lower bounds
the minimum dimension of an “oblivious subspace embedding”, a particular type of data structure
construction that preserves ∥Xβ∥2. A more recent example in this line of work is [6], which provides
space complexity lower bounds for general data structures that preserves ∥Xβ∥p for general p ∈N.

Recent work on the development of coresets for logistic regression motivates our focus on this
problem. This line of work was initiated by Munteanu et al. [10]. Mai et al. [7] used Lewis weight
sampling to achieve an ˜O(dµy(X)2 · ϵ−2). The work of Woodruff and Yasuda [17] later provided an
online coreset construction containing ˜O(dµy(X)2·ϵ−2) points as well as a coreset construction using
˜O(d2µy(X) · ϵ−2) points. Finally, Munteanu and Omlor [9] recently proved an ˜O(dµy(X) · ϵ−2)
size coreset construction. Our work is complementary to the above works, since it highlights the
limits of possible compression of the logistic regression problem while maintaining approximation
guarantees to the original problem.

Notation

We assume, without loss of generality, that yi = −1 for all i = 1 . . . n. Any logistic regression
problem with (X, y) defined above can be transformed to this standard form by multiplying both
X and y by the matrix −Dy. Here Dy ∈Rn×n is a diagonal matrix with i-th entry set as yi. The
logistic loss of the original problem is equal to that of the transformed problem for all β ∈Rd. Let
Mi denote the i-th row of a matrix M. We denote as X the matrix formed by stacking xi as rows.
We will use ˜O(·) and ˜Ω(·) to suppress logarithmic factors of d, n, 1/ϵ, and µy(X). Finally, let
[n] = {1, 2, ..., n}.

Space complexity lower bounds

In this section, we provide space complexity lower bounds for a data structure ˜L(·) that satisfies the
relative error guarantee in eqn. 2. We use the notations as specified in Section 1. Additionally, we
require throughout this section that the entries of X can be specified in O(log nd) bits.

Our first main result is a general lower bound on the space complexity of any data structure which
approximates logistic loss to ϵ-relative error for every parameter vector β ∈Rd on a data set whose

3


---Page Break---
complexity measure µy(X) is bounded by a constant. As a corollary to this result, we show that
existing coreset constructions are optimal up to lower order terms in the regime where µy(X) = O(1).
Our second main result shows that any data structure providing a ϵ0-constant factor approximation to
the logistic loss requires ˜Ω(µy(X)) space, where ϵ0 > 0 is constant. Both of these results proceed by
reduction to the INDEX problem [6, 8] (see Section A.2), where we use the fact that an approximation
to the logistic loss can approximate ReLU loss under appropriate conditions.

Consider the ReLU loss:

R(β; X) =

n
X

i=1
max{xT
i β, 0}.
(4)

Our lower bound reductions hinge on the fact that a relative error approximation to logistic loss can
be used to simulate a relative error approximation to ReLU loss under appropriate conditions. We
capture this in the following lemma. We include all proofs omitted from the main text in Appendix B.
Lemma 2.1. Given a data set X ∈Rn×d and B ⊂Rd such that infβ∈B R(β; X) > 1, if there exists
a data structure ˜L(·) that satisfies:

(1 −ϵ)L(β) ≤˜L(β) ≤(1 + ϵ)L(β) for all β ∈B,

then there exists a data structure taking ˜O(1) extra space such that:

(1 −3ϵ)R(β) ≤˜R(β) ≤(1 + 3ϵ)R(β) for all β ∈B.

2.1
Lower bounds for the µy(X) = Θ(1) regime

We lower bound the space complexity of any data structure that approximates logistic loss to ϵ-relative
error. Recall that the running time of the computation compressing the data to a small number of bits
and evaluating ˜L(β) for a given query β is unbounded in this model. Hence, Theorem 1 provides a
strong lower bound on the space needed for any compression of the data that can be used to compute
an ϵ-relative error approximation to the logistic loss, including, but not limited to, coresets.

At a high level, our proof operates by showing that a relative error approximation to logistic loss can
be used to obtain a relative error approximation to ReLu regression, which in turn can be used to
construct a relative error ℓ1-subspace embedding. Previously, Li et al. [6] lower bounded the worst
case space complexity of any data structure that maintains an ℓ1-subspace embedding by reducing the
problem to the well-known INDEX problem in communication complexity. Notably, the construction
of X has complexity measure bounded by a constant, i.e., µy(X) = O(1).

Lemma 2.2. There exists a matrix X ∈Rn×d such that µy(X) ≤4 and any data structure that, with
at least 2/3 probability, approximates R(β; X) up to ϵ-relative error requires ˜Ω( d

ϵ2 ) space, provided
that d = Ω(log 1/ϵ), n = ˜Ω(d/ϵ2), and 0 < ϵ ≤ϵ0 for some small constant ϵ0.

Furthermore, R(β; X) > 3∥β∥1 for all β ∈Rd.

Using Lemma 2.1, we can extend this lower bound on the space complexity to approximate ReLU
loss to logistic loss.

Theorem 1. Any data structure ˜L(·) that, with at least 2/3 probability, is an ϵ-relative error
approximation to logistic loss for some input (X, y), requires ˜Ω
  d

assuming that d = Ω(log 1/ϵ), n = ˜Ω
 
dϵ−2
, and 0 < ϵ ≤ϵ0 for some sufficiently small constant
ϵ0.

Proof. By Lemma 2.2, there exists a matrix X such that any data structure that approximates the
ReLU loss up to ϵ-relative error requires the stated space complexity. Let

B = {β ∈Rd | ∥β∥1 = 1}

Then, by Lemma 2.2, infβ∈B R(β; X) ≥3. Therefore, by Lemma 2.1, any (1 + ϵ) factor approxima-
tion to the logistic loss for the matrix X provides a (1 + 3ϵ)-factor approximation to R(β; X) for
β ∈B. Since R(β) = ∥β∥1 · R(β/∥β∥1), we can extend this guarantee to all β ∈Rd. By Lemma 2.2,
any data structure that provides such a guarantee requires the stated space complexity, and, finally,
˜L(·) requires the stated complexity.

From the above theorem, we can derive a lower bound on the number of rows needed by a coreset
that achieves an ϵ-relative error approximation to the logistic loss (see eqn. 3 for specification of a
coreset).

Corollary 2. Any coreset construction that, with at least 2/3 probability, satisfies the relative error
guarantee in eqn. 2 must store ˜Ω( d

ϵ2 ) rows of some input matrix X, where µy(X) = O(1).

Proof. Using the previous theorem, there exists a matrix X ∈Rn×O(log n) such that, assuming that
n = ˜Ω(ϵ−2) and ϵ is sufficiently small, any data structure that approximates the logistic loss up to
relative error on X must use ˜Ω(1/ϵ2) bits in the worst case. (Recall that ˜Ω(·) suppresses log n factors.)

If the data structure stores entire rows of X while storing a total of ˜Ω( 1

ϵ2 ) bits, then it must store at
least

˜Ω

ϵ2 ·

log n



 1

rows of X in total.

Recall that the proof of Theorem 1 proceeds by showing that a relative error approximation to the
logistic loss can be used to solve the INDEX problem. If we have d independent instances of the
matrix X, i.e., X(1), X(2), ...X(d), then we may create the matrix

Y =

Note that any relative error approximation to the logistic loss on Y would allow relative error
approximation to the logistic loss on each of the individual X(i), i = 1 . . . d matrices, thus allowing
one to solve d instances of the INDEX problem simultaneously. This implies that we can query any
bit in each of the d index problems which solves an INDEX problem of size ˜Ω(d/ϵ2).

If the data structure is restricted to store entire rows of X(i), then recall that we must store ˜Ω(1/ϵ2)
rows of X(i). Therefore, we conclude that any coreset that achieves a relative error approximation to
the logistic loss on Y with at least 2/3 probability must store ˜Ω(d/ϵ2) rows of Y.

The work of Munteanu and Omlor [9] showed that sampling ˜O

rows of X yields an
ϵ-relative error coreset for logistic loss with high probability. Hence, Corollary 2 implies that the
coreset construction of Mai et al. [7] is of optimal size in the regime where µy(X) = O(1). However,
Theorem 1 only guarantees that coresets are optimal up to a d factor in terms of bit complexity. An
interesting future direction would be closing this gap by either proving that coresets have optimal
bit complexity or showing approaches, like matrix sparsification, could achieve even greater space
savings.

2.2
An ˜Ω(µy(X) · d) lower bound

In this section, we provide a space complexity lower bound for a data structure achieving a constant
ϵ0-relative error approximation to logistic loss on an input X with variable µy(X). We again assume
yi = −1 for all i ∈[n] without loss of generality.

The proof depends on the existence of a matrix M ∈{−1, 1}n×log4 n that has nearly orthogonal rows.
From M, we can construct the matrix X such that µy(X) = O(n) and a 2-factor approximation to
ReLU loss on X can solve the size n INDEX problem. By Lemma 2.1 and the lower space complexity
bound for solving the INDEX problem, we prove the described lower bound for approximating logistic
loss.

We begin by proving the existence of the matrix M. Recall that for any matrix M, we use Mi to
denote the i-th row of M.

5


---Page Break---
Lemma 2.3. Let n = 2p for n ∈N. There exists a matrix M ∈{−1, 1}n×k such that k = log4 n
and |⟨Mi, Mj⟩| ≤4 log2 n for all i ̸= j.

We now use the previous lemma to construct a matrix X such that a 2-factor approximation to ReLU
loss on X requires ˜Ω(d · µy(X)) space.

Lemma 2.4. Let n = 2p for n ∈N and assume that log4(n/2) > 16 log2 n. Then, there exists a
matrix X ∈Rn×k such that k = O(log4 n) and µy(X) = O(n) such that any data structure ˜R(·)
that, with at least 2/3 probability, satisfies (for a fixed β ∈Rd)

R(β) ≤˜R(β) ≤2R(β)

and requires at least Ω(n) bits of space.

Proof. Our proof will proceed by reduction to the INDEX problem. Let yi ∈{0, 1} for all i =
1 . . . n/2] represent an arbitrary sequence of n/2 bits. We will show how to encode the state of the n
bits in a relative error approximation to ReLU loss on some data set X.

First, let us start with the matrix M ∈{−1, 1}n/2×k′ specified in Lemma 2.3, where k′ = log4(n/2).
Let ˜M ∈Rn/2×k′ such that ˜Mi∗= ˜Mi∗if yi = 1 and ˜Mi∗= 1/2 · Mi∗otherwise. In words, we
multiply the i-th row of M by one if yi = 1 and 1/2 if yi = 0. Next, let us construct the matrix
X ∈Rn×k′+1:

X =

−µ · 1

,
(5)

where µ > 0 will be specified later.

Suppose we want to query yi. Let β = [ ˜Mi, −4 log2 n]T . We will show that ˜Mjβ < µ · 8 log2 n for
all j ̸= i by considering three cases:

Case 1 (j ≤n/2; j ̸= i): In this case, ˜Mjβ = ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mj⟩−4 log2 n. By Lemma 2.3, ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mj⟩≤
⟨Mi, Mj⟩< 4 log2(n/2), hence we can conclude this case.

Case 2 (j > n/2; j ̸= 2i): Here, Xjβ = −µ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mj⟩+ 4µ log2 n. Since |⟨˜Mi, ˜Mj⟩| ≤
|⟨Mi, Mj⟩| < 4 log2 n, Xjβ < µ · 8 log2 n, so we conclude the case.

Case 3 (j = 2i): In this case, Xjβ = −µ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mi⟩+ 4µ log2 n. Since −µ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mi⟩is negative,
we conclude the case.

The above cases show that Xjβ < µ · 8 log2 n when j ̸= i. Therefore,

R(β) ≤n · µ · 8 log2 n + ReLU(Xiβ)
and
R(β) ≥ReLU(Xiβ).

We next show that the bit yi will have a large effect on R(β). If yi = 0, then,

Xiβ = ⟨˜Mi, ˜Mi⟩= 1

4∥Mi∥2
2 −4 log2 n < 1

4 · log4(n/2),

since ˜Mi ∈Rlog4(n/2). On the other hand, if yi = 1, then,

Xiβ = ∥˜Mi∥2
2 −4 log2 n = log4(n/2) −4 log2 n > 3

4 log4(n/2),

where we used our assumption that log4(n/2) > 16 log2 n. Therefore, if yi = 0, R(β) ≤1

4 ·log4 n+

n · 8µ log2 n. By setting µ = log2 n

26·n , we find that R(β) < 3

8 log4(n/2). On the other hand, if yi = 1,
then R(β) > 3

4 log4 n/2. Therefore, a 2-factor approximation to R(β) is able to decide if yi equals
zero or one. By reduction to the INDEX problem, this implies that any 2-factor approximation to
R(β) must take at least Ω(n) space (see Theorem 6).

Now we must just prove that µy(X) = O(n). We will use the following inequality [13]. For any two
length n sequences of positive numbers, ar, r = 1 . . . n and br, r = 1 . . . n,
Pn
r=1 ar

where the maximum is taken over an arbitrary fixed ordering of the sequences. Let us define these
two sequences as follows for a fixed β ∈Rd. For i ∈1 . . . n/2, if Xiβ > 0, let ai = Xiβ and
bi = −1 · X2iβ. If Xiβ < 0, let ai = X2iβ and bi = −1 · Xiβ. We can disregard the case where
Xiβ = 0, since this will not affect the sums of the sequences. Given such sequences, we get:

∥(Xβ)+∥1

The last inequality follows since X2iβ = −µ · Xiβ for i = 1 . . . n/2. Hence, we conclude that
µy(X) = µ−1 = O(n).

The above theorem proves that a constant factor approximation to R(·) requires Ω(µy(X)) space.
We now extend this result to logistic loss.

Theorem 3. Let n ≥n0 (for some constant n0 ∈N) be a positive integer. There exists a global
constant ϵ0 > 0 and a matrix X ∈Rn×k such that any data structure ˜L(·) that, with at least 2/3
probability, satisfies (for a fixed β ∈Rd):

(1 −ϵ0)L(β; X) ≤˜L(β; X) ≤(1 + ϵ0)L(β; X)

and requires at least ˜Ω(d · µy(X)) bits of space.

Proof. The space complexity lower bound holds even if ˜L(·) approximates ˜R(·) only on the values
of β used to query the data structure in the proof of Lemma 2.4. Define this set as

B = {[ ˜Mi, −4 log2 n]T ∈Rk′ | i = 1 . . . n/2},

where ˜M is used to construct X in eqn. 5. Since R(β) ≥Xiβ, we get

R(β) ≥∥˜Mi∥2
2 −4 log2 n ≥log4(n/2)

4
−4 log2 n.

Therefore, R(β) ≥1 for all n ≥n0, where n0 is some constant in N. By Lemma 2.1, the space
complexity of a data structure that achieves

(1 −ϵ)L(β) ≤˜L(β) ≤(1 + ϵ)L(β)

for a fixed β ∈B must be at least the space complexity of a data structure achieving

R(β) ≤˜R(β) ≤(1 + 3ϵ)

(1 −3ϵ)R(β)

for β ∈B. We can now solve for ϵ by setting (1+3ϵ)/(1−3ϵ) = 2. Therefore, from Lemma 2.4, we
conclude that there exists a constant ϵ0 > 0 such that any data structure providing an ϵ0-relative
approximation to the logistic loss requires at least ˜Ω(n) = ˜Ω(µy(X)) space.

Finally, applying the argument used in Corollary 2 of constructing a matrix Y, we achieve an
˜Ω(d · µy(X)) lower bound.

While prior work has show that mergeable coresets must include Ω(d · µy(X)) points to attain a
constant factor guarantee to logistic loss [17], our lower bound result holds for general data structures
and applies even for data structure providing the weaker “for-each” guarantee, where the guarantee
must hold for an arbitrary but fixed β ∈Rd with a specified probability. The proof of the lower bound
in [17] relies on constructing a matrix A that encodes n bits such that the i-th bit can be recovered by
adding some points to A and performing logistic regression on the new matrix. Hence, a mergeable
coreset that compresses A can be used to solve the INDEX problem of size n. Meanwhile, our proof
does not require constructing a regression problem but rather allows recovering the i-th bit by only
observing an approximate value of the ReLU loss at a single fixed input vector for a fixed matrix
A. In addition to an arguably simpler proof, our approach needs weaker assumptions on the data
structure. Therefore, our lower bound applies in more general settings, i.e., when sparsification is
applied to X.

Computing the complexity measure µy(X) in polynomial time

We present an efficient algorithm to compute the data complexity measure µy(X) of Definition 1
on real data sets, refuting an earlier conjecture that this measure was hard to compute [10]. The
importance of this measure for logistic regression has been well-documented in prior work and further
understanding its behavior on real-world data sets would help guide further improvements to coreset
construction for logistic regression.

Prior work conjectured that µy(X) was hard to compute and presented a polynomial time algorithm
to approximate the measure to within a poly(d)-factor (see Theorem 3 of Munteanu et al. [10]).
We refute this conjecture by showing that the complexity measure µy(X) can in fact be computed
efficiently via linear programming, as shown in the following theorem. The specific LP formulation
for computing a vector β∗such that µy(X) = ∥(DyXβ∗)−∥1

∥(DyXβ∗)+∥1 is given in eqn. (9) in the Appendix.

Theorem 4. If the complexity measure µy(X) of Definition 1 is finite, it can be computed exactly by
solving a linear program with 2n variables and 4n constraints.

We conclude the section by noting that prior experimental evaluations of coreset constructions
in [10, 7] relied on estimates of µy(X) using the method provided by Munteanu et al. [10]. We will
empirically compare how prior methods of estimating the complexity measure compare to our exact
method in Section 4.

Experiments

We provide empirical evidence verifying the algorithm of Section 3 to exactly computes the classi-
fication complexity measure µy(X) of Definition 1. We compare our results with the approximate
sketching-based calculation of Munteanu et al. [10].

In order to estimate µy(X) for a dataset using the sketching-based approach of Munteanu et al.
[10], we create several smaller sketched datasets of a given full dataset of size n × d (n rows and
d columns). We then use a modified linear program along the lines of Munteanu et al. [10]. These
new datasets are created so that they have number of rows n′ = O(d log(d/δ)), for various values
of δ ∈[0, 1], so that with probability at least 1 −δ, the estimated µy(X) will lie between some
lower bound (given by t, the optimum value of the aforementioned linear program) and an upper
bound (given by t · O(d log d)). In order to solve the modified linear programs, we make use of the
OR-tools1.

Synthetic data: We create the synthetic dataset as follows. First, we construct the full data matrix
X ∈Rn×d by drawing n = 10, 000 samples from the d-dimensional Gaussian distribution N(0, Id)
with d = 100. We generate an arbitrary β ∈Rd with ∥β∥2 = 1 and generate the posterior
p(yi|xi) = 1/(1 + exp(−β⊤xi + N(0, 1))). Finally, we create the labels yi for all i = 1 . . . n by
setting yi to one if p(yi|xi) > 0.5 and to −1 otherwise.

Using the full data matrix A = DyX, we create several sketched data matrices having a number
of rows equal to n′ = O(d log(d/δ)). We choose δ so that n′ ∈{512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}.
These values of n′ are chosen to be powers of two so that we can employ the Fast Cauchy Transform
algorithm (FastL1Basis [1]) for sketching. The algorithm is meant to ensure that the produced
sketch identifies ℓ1 well-conditioned bases for A, which is a prerequisite for using the subsequent
linear program to estimate µy(X). (See Section C for details).

The results are presented in Figure 1a. For various values of n′, including when n′ = n = 10, 000,
which we deem to be the original data size, we show the exact computation of µy(X) on the sketched
matrix using the linear program of Theorem 4. We also show the corresponding upper and lower
bounds on µy(X) of the full data set as estimated by the well-conditioned basis hunting approximation
proposed by Munteanu et al. [10]. For the lower bound, we use the optimum value of the modified
linear program as proposed in Munteanu et al. [10] and detailed in Section C. We set the upper bound
by multiplying the lower bound by d log(d/δ). Note that this upper bound is conservative, and the
actual upper bound could be a constant factor higher, since the guarantees of Munteanu et al. [10] are
only up to a constant factor. The presented results are an average over 20 runs of different sketches

for each value of n′. Figure 1a shows that the exact computations on sketched matrices are close to
the actual µy(X) of the full data matrix, while the upper and lower bounds as proposed by Munteanu
et al. [10] can be fairly loose.

Real data experiments: To test our setup on real data, we make use of the sklearn KDDcup
dataset.2 The dataset consists of 100654 data points and over 50 features. We only use continuous
features which reduces the feature size to 33. The dataset contains 3377 positive data points, while the
rest are negative. To create various sized subsets for exact calculation, we subsample from positives
and negatives so that they are in about equal proportion. For larger subsamples, we retain all the
positives, and subsample the rest from the negative data points. Since the calculation of µ for the
full dataset is intractable as it will require to solve an optimization problem of over 400k constraints,
we subsample 16384 data points and use its µ as proxy for that of the full dataset (referred to as
ExactFull. For such a large subsample, the error bars are small. We compare against sketching
and exact µ calculations for smaller subset (See Figure 1b for the results).

Future work

Our work shows that existing coresets are optimal up to lower order factors in the regime where
µy(X) = O(1). A clear open direction would be proving a space complexity lower bound that holds
for all valid values of ϵ and µy(X). Additionally, there is still a d factor gap between existing upper
bounds [9] and our lower bounds (Theorems 1 and 3) in the regime where ϵ is constant and the
complexity measure varies or the complexity measure is constant and ϵ varies respectively.

Another interesting direction would be to explore whether additional techniques can further reduce
the space complexity in approximating logistic loss compared to coresets alone. While Theorem 1
shows that the size of coreset constructions are essentially optimal, it does not preclude reducing the
space by a d factor by using other methods. In particular, the construction of X used in the proof of
Theorem 1 is sparse, and so existing matrix sparsification methods would save this d factor here.

We also note that our first lower bound (Theorem 1) only applies to data structures providing the the
“for-all” guarantee on the logistic loss, i.e., with a given probability, the error guarantee in eqn.(2)
holds for all β ∈Rd. It would be interesting to know if it could strengthened to apply in the “for-each”
setting as Theorem 3 does, where β ∈Rd is arbitrary but fixed.

Finally, it would be useful to gain a better understanding of the complexity measure µy(X) in real
data through more comprehensive experiments using our method provided in Theorem 4. In particular,
subsampling points of a data set may create bias when computing µy(X).

Preliminaries

In this section, we list some useful results from prior work.

A.1
Hoeffding’s inequality

We use the following formulation of Hoeffding’s inequality.

A.2
INDEX problem

Both Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 rely on a reduction to the randomized INDEX problem. We define
the INDEX problem as a data structure as done in [6].

Definition 2. (INDEX problem) The INDEX data structure stores an input string y ∈{0, 1}n and
supports a query function, which receives input i ∈[n] and outputs yi ∈{0, 1} which is the i-th bit
of the underlying string.

The following theorem provides a space complexity lower bound for the INDEX problem.

Theorem 6. (see [8]) In the INDEX problem, suppose that the underlying string y is drawn uniformly
from {0, 1}n and the input i of the query function is drawn uniformly from [n]. Any (randomized)
data structure for INDEX that succeeds with probability at least 2/3 requires Ω(n) bits of space,
where the randomness is taken over both the randomness in the data structure and the randomness of
s and i.

Proofs

Proof for Lemma 2.1

Proof. Let Rmin = infβ∈Rd R(β). We now prove that a data structure, ˜L(·), which approximates
logistic loss to relative error can be used to construct an approximation to the ReLu loss, ˜R(·), by
˜R(β) =
1
t · ˜L(t · β) for large enough constant t > 0. To show this, we start by bounding the
approximation error of the logistic loss for a single point. First, we derive the following inequality
when r > 0:

1

t log(1 + et·r) −r = 1

t · ert .

Therefore, if xT
i β > 0, then | 1

t log(1+et·xT
i β)−xT
i β| <
1

t·et·xT
i β . Next, we consider the case where

r ≤0, in which case ReLu(r) = 0. It directly follows that 0 ≤1

t log(1 + et·r) ≤et·r

t . Therefore,

|1

t · log(1 + et·r) −max{0, r}| ≤
1
t · et·|r| ≤1

t .

We use these inequalities to bound the difference in the transformed logistic loss and ReLu loss as
follows:

|1

t · L(t · β) −R(β)| =


n

Therefore, if we set t∗=

ϵ·Rmin(β), then

| 1

t∗L(t∗· β) −R(β)| ≤ϵRmin(β) ≤ϵR(β),
(7)

for all β ∈B. We can then show that ˜L(·) can be used to approximate R(·) by applying the triangle
inequality, the error guarantee of ˜L(·) and eqn. 7. For all β ∈B:

Note that we can set Rmin to one and achieve the same error guarantee, since infβ∈B R(β) > 1.
Therefore, storing t∗takes O(log n

ϵ ) space.

Proof for Lemma 2.2

Proof. We will first lower bound the space needed by any data structure which approximates ReLu
loss to ϵ-relative error. Later, we will show that this implies a lower bound on the space complexity
of any data structure f(·) for approximating logistic loss. Let ˜R(·) approximate R(·) such that
R(β) ≤˜R(β) ≤(1 + ϵ)R(β) for all β ∈Rd. We can rewrite R(β) as follows:

R(β) =

n
X

i=1
max{0, xT
i β} =

n
X

i=1

1/2 · xT
i β + 1/2 · |xT
i β| = 1

21T Xβ + 1

2∥Xβ∥1.

We next use the fact that R(β) ≤∥Xβ∥1 to get

|R(β) −˜R(β)| = |1

21T Xβ + 1

2∥Xβ∥1 −˜R(β)| ≤ϵR(β)

⇒|1

21T Xβ + 1

2∥Xβ∥1 −˜R(β)| ≤ϵ∥Xβ∥1.

We can store 1T X exactly in O(d) space as a length d vector. We define a new data structure H(·)
such that H(β) = 2 ˜R(β) −1T Xβ, and, using the above inequality, H(β) satisfies:

|∥Xβ∥1 −H(β)| ≤2ϵ∥Xβ∥1,

for all β ∈Rd. Therefore, H(β) is an ϵ-relative approximation to ∥Xβ∥1 after adjusting for constants
and solves the ℓ1-subspace sketch problem (see Definition 1.1 in [6]). By Corollary 3.13 in [6], the
data structure H(·) requires ˜Ω
  d

ϵ2

bits of space if d = Ω(log 1/ϵ) and n = ˜Ω
 
dϵ−2
. Therefore,
we conclude that any data structure which approximates R(β) to ϵ-relative error for all β ∈Rd with
at least 2/3 probability must use ˜Ω
  d

ϵ2

bits in the worst case.

The proof in [6] that leads to Corollary 3.13 proceeds by constructing a matrix A (X in our notation)
and showing that ϵ-relative error approximations to ∥Aβ∥1 require the stated space complexity. We
next show that, µy(A) ≤4. The construction of A is described directly above Lemma 3.10. This
matrix A is first set to contain all 2k unique k length vectors in {−1, 1}k for some value of k. Each
row of A is then re-weighted: specifically, the i-th row of A is re-weighted by some yi ∈[2
√

k, 8
√

k].

For any vector β ∈Rd, ∥(Aβ)+∥1 ≤4 · ∥(Aβ)−∥1 by the following argument. For an arbitrary
i ∈[n], let Ai = yi · v where {±1}k. Then there exists a unique j ∈[n] such that Aj = −1 · yj · v,
and so Ajβ < 0. Furthermore, since yj ≥2
√

k and yi ≤8
√

k, |Aiβ|

|Ajβ| ≤4. By applying this
argument to each row of A where Aiβ > 0, we conclude that ∥(Aβ)+∥1 ≤4 · ∥(Aβ)−∥1, and
hence µy(X) ≤4.

12


---Page Break---
Finally, we show that R(β; X) is lower bounded in this construction. Given any vector β ∈Rd,
there exists a row of X such that Xij · βj ≥0 for all j ∈{1 . . . d}, that is, the j-th entry of Xi has
the same sign as βj in all non-zero entries of β. Therefore, Xiβ = yi · ∥β∥1. Since yi ≥3
√

k, we
conclude that R(β; X) ≥3∥β∥1.

Proof of Lemma 2.3

Proof. Let A ∈{−1, 1}n×k be a random matrix where each entry is uniformly sampled from
{−1, 1} in independent identical trials. Let {Rr}r∈[k] be independent Rademacher random variables.
Then,

P(|⟨Ai, Aj⟩| ≥t) = P

where the last step follows from applying Hoeffding’s inequality. There are fewer than n2 tuples
(i, j) ∈{1 . . . d} × {1 . . . d} such that i ̸= j. Therefore, by an application of the union bound,

P(|⟨Ai, Aj⟩| ≥t for all i ̸= j) ≤n2 · 2 exp
−t2

2k

.

Setting t = 4
√

k · log n, we see that the right side of the inequality is less than one whenever n > 1.
Therefore, there must exist a matrix M satisfying the specified criteria.

Proof of Theorem 4

Proof. We now derive a linear programming formulation to compute the complexity measure in
Definition 1. Note that we flip the numerator and denominator from Definition 1 without loss of
generality. Let β∗∈Rd be:3

β∗= argmax
∥β∥2=1

∥(DyXβ)−∥1
∥(DyXβ)+∥1

⇒µy(X) = ∥(DyXβ∗)−∥1

∥(DyXβ∗)+∥1

The second line above uses the fact that the definition of µy(X) does not depend on the scaling of β.
If C is an arbitrary positive constant, then there exists a constant c > 0 such that:

c · β∗= argmax
β∈Rd
∥(DyXβ)−∥1 such that ∥(DyXβ)+∥1 ≤C

= argmax
β∈Rd
∥DyXβ∥1 such that ∥(DyXβ)+∥1 ≤C.

Again, ∥(DyXβ∗)−∥1/∥(DyXβ∗)+∥1 is invariant to rescaling of β∗, so we may assume that c is equal to
one without loss of generality. We now reformulate the last constraint as follows:

∥(DyXβ)+∥1 =

n
X

i=1
max{[DyXβ]i, 0}

=

n
X

i=1

1
2[DyXβ]i + 1

2|[DyXβ]i|

= 1

21T DyXβ + 1

2∥DyXβ∥1.

Therefore, the above formulation is equivalent to:

β∗= argmax
β∈Rd
∥DyXβ∥1
such that 1

21T DyXβ + 1

2∥DyXβ∥1 ≤C

= argmin
β∈Rd
1T DyXβ such that ∥DyXβ∥1 ≤C.

3For notational simplicity, we assume β∗is unique, but this is not necessary.

13


---Page Break---
Next, we replace DyXβ with a single vector z ∈Rn and a linear constraint to guarantee that
z ∈Range(DyX). Let PR ∈Rn×n be the orthogonal projection to Range(DyX). Then,

z∗= argmin
z∈Rd
1T z
(8)

such that ∥z∥1 ≤C
and
(I −PR)z = 0.

Next, we solve this formulation by constructing a linear program such that [z+, z−] ∈R2n corre-
sponds to the absolute value of the positive and negative elements of z, namely

z∗= argmin
β∈Rd
1T
n(z+ −z−)
(9)

such that 1T
n(z+ + z−) ≤C
and
(I −PR)(z+ −z−) = 0
and
z+, z−≥0.

Observe that this is a linear program with 2n variables and 4n constraints. After solving this program
for z∗
+ and z∗
−, we can compute z∗= z∗
+ −z∗
−. From this, we can compute β∗by solving the linear
system z∗= DyXβ∗, which is guaranteed to have a solution by the linear constraint (I−PR)z∗= 0.

After solving for β∗, we can compute

µy(X) = ∥(DyXβ∗)−∥1

∥(DyXβ∗)+∥1
,

thus completing the proof.

C
Modified linear program

For completeness, we reproduce the linear program of Munteanu et al. [10][Section A] to estimate
the complexity measure µy(X):

min

n
X

i=1
bi

s.t. ∀i ∈[n] : (Uβ)i = ai −bi
∀i ∈[d] : βi = ci −di

d
X

i=1
ci + di ≥1

∀i ∈[n] : ai, bi ≥0
∀i ∈[d] : ci, di ≥0.

Here, U is ℓ1-well-conditioned basis [2] of the matrix DyX. Because of the well-conditioned
property, µ can be estimated to be within the bounds:

1

t ≤µy(X) ≤poly(d).1

t ,

where t = min∥β∥1=1 ∥(Uβ)−∥1, and recall that d is the number of columns of X. Munteanu et al.
[10] designed the above linear program to solve for t. However, note that trivially the LP as it is
written could be trivially solved with ∀ici = di =⇒βi = 0 =⇒ai = bi = 0, which unfortunately
gives t = 0 always trivially. To get around this problem, we modify the above program as follows:

min

n
X

i=1
bi

s.t. ∀i ∈[n] : (Uβ)i = ai −bi
∀i ∈[d] : hi = ci −βi
∀i ∈[d] : hi = di + βi
∀i ∈[d] : ci ≤Mvi
∀i ∈[d] : di ≤M(1 −vi)

i=1
hi ≥1

∀i ∈[n] : ai, bi ≥0
∀i ∈[d] : ci, di, hi ≥0
∀i ∈[d] : vi ∈{0, 1}

Here, M is a sufficiently large value as is often used for Big-M constraints4 in linear programs. The
variable hi simulates the |βi|, and is set according to the binary variable vi which decides which one
of ci or di is 0. Further, note that P

i hi ≥1 is equivalent to P

i hi = 1 here since scaling down the
norm of β can only bring the optimization cost down. To solve the optimization problem, we use the
Google OR-tools and the wrapper pywraplp with the solver SAT which can handle integer
programs since the above program is no longer a pure linear program because of the binary variables
vi.

Low rank approximation to logistic loss

Here, we provide a very simple data structure that provides an additive error approximation to the
logistic loss. While the method is straightforward, we are unaware of this approximation being
specified in prior work, and it may be useful in the natural setting where the input matrix X has low
stable rank.

We show that any low-rank approximation ¯X of the data matrix X can be used to approximate the
logistic loss function L(β) up to a √n∥X −¯X∥2∥β∥2 additive error. The factor ∥X −¯X∥2∥β∥2
is the spectral norm (or two-norm) error of the low-rank approximation and we also prove that this
bound is tight in the worst case. Low rank approximations are commonly used to reduce the time
and space complexity of numerical algorithms, especially in settings where the data matrix X is
numerically low-rank or has a decaying spectrum of singular values.

Using low-rank approximations of X to estimate the logistic loss is appealing due to the extensive
body work on fast constructions of low-rank approximations via sketching, sampling, and direct
methods [5]. We show that a spectral approximation provides an additive error guarantee for the
logistic loss and that this guarantee is tight on worst-case inputs.

Theorem 7. If X, ˜X ∈Rn×d, then for all β ∈Rd,

|L(β; X) −L(β, ˜X)| ≤√n∥X −˜X∥2∥β∥2.

Proof. To simplify the notation, let s = Xβ and d = (X −˜X)β. We can then write the difference
in the log loss as:

|L(β; X) −L(β, ˜X)| =

Therefore, we can conclude that |L(β; X) −L(β; ˜X)| ≤∥d∥1 ≤√n∥d∥2 ≤√n∥˜X −X∥2∥β∥2.

We note that Theorem 7 holds for any matrix ˜X ∈Rn×d that approximates X with respect to the
spectral norm, and does not necessitate that ˜X has low-rank. We now provide a matching lower-bound
for the logistic loss function in the same setting.
Theorem 8. For every d, n ∈N where d ≥n, there exists a data matrix X ∈Rn×d, label vector
y ∈{−1, 1}n, parameter vector β ∈Rd, and spectral approximation ˜X ∈Rn×d such that:

|L(β; ¯X) −L(β; X)| ≥(1 −δ)√n∥X −¯X∥2∥β∥2,

for every δ > 0. Hence, the guarantee of Theorem 7 is tight in the worst case.

Proof. To prove the theorems statement, we first consider the case of square matrices (d = n). In
particular, first consider the case where d = n = 1, where X = [x] and ˜X = [x + s], in which case
∥X −˜X∥2 = s. Then,

lim
x→∞L([1]; [x + s]) −L([1]; [x]) = lim
x→∞log(1 + ex+s) −log(1 + ex) = s

Which shows that for β = [1] and x with large enough magnitude L(β; ˜X) −L(β; X) = (1 −
δ)∥X −˜X∥2. Next, let X = x · In, ˜X = (x + s) · In, and β = 1n. Then for all i ∈[n], xT
i β = x
and xT
i β = x + s. Therefore,

lim
x→∞L(β; ˜X) −L(β; X) = lim
x→∞

n
X

i=1


log(1 + ex+s) −log(1 + ex)

= sn.

Since ∥X −˜X∥2 = ∥s · I∥2 = s. ∥β∥2 = √n,

lim
x→∞L(β; ˜X) −L(β; X) = sn = √n∥X −˜X∥2∥β∥2

Hence, we conclude the statement of the theorem for the case where d = n. To conclude the case for
d ≥n, note that √n∥X −¯X∥2∥β∥2 does not change if we extend X and ¯X with columns of zeroes
and extend β with entries of zero until X, ¯X ∈Rn×d and Rd. This procedure also does not change
the loss at β, hence we conclude the statement of the theorem.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We state our contributions in Section 1.1 and link to the results in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We mention that we do not focus on lower order (logarithmic) factors in
our theoretical analysis. Additionally, we point out more comprehensive experiments in
computing µy(X) for real datasets as an open direction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have rigorously derived all theoretical results and provided clear references
to the results we depend on in prior work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Code and instructions to reproduce our results are provided in the supplemen-
tary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code and instructions to reproduce our results are provided in the supplemen-
tary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We do not provide a learning algorithm, so there are no data splits or training.
Code and instructions to reproduce our results are provided in the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide error bars in are figures that are sufficient to show statistical
significance of the observed behavior.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

19


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Our focus is primarily theoretical, and our experiments do not require signifi-
cant compute resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow all of the relevant ethical guidelines.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: While we expect our work to benefit the development of methods for logistic
regression, our work is far upstream from any applications, and hence it is not possible to
productively consider broader impact.

Guidelines:

20


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work is not related to any of these mentioned areas.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We give proper attribution for the code we use from prior work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide code with documentation in the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
