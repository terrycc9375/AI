Abstract

Existing methods for relightable view synthesis — using a set of images of an
object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered
from novel viewpoints under a target illumination — are based on inverse ren-
dering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting
that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization
through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-
expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each
input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on target environment
lighting and estimated object geometry. We then reconstruct a Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the
target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks. Please see our

Introduction

Capturing an object’s appearance so that it can be accurately rendered in novel environments is
a central problem in computer vision whose solution would democratize 3D content creation for
augmented and virtual reality, photography, filmmaking, and game development. Recent advances in
view synthesis [36] have made impressive progress in reconstructing a 3D representation that can
be rendered from novel viewpoints, using just a set of observed images. However, those methods

typically only recover the appearance of the object under the captured illumination, and relightable
view synthesis — rendering novel views of the captured object under arbitrary target environments —
remains challenging.

Recent methods for recovering relightable 3D representations treat this task as inverse rendering,
and attempt to estimate the geometry, materials, and illumination that jointly explain the input
images using physically-based rendering methods. These approaches typically involve gradient-
based optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering procedures, which are noisy and
computationally-expensive. Moreover, the inverse rendering optimization problem is brittle and
inherently ambiguous; many potential sets of geometry, materials, and lighting can explain the input
images, but many of these incorrect explanations produce obviously implausible renderings when
rendered under novel unobserved illumination.

We propose a different approach that avoids inverse rendering and instead leverages a generative
image model fine-tuned for the task of relighting. Given a set of images viewing an object and a
desired target illumination, we use a single-image 2D Relighting Diffusion Model that outputs relit
images of the object under the target illumination. Due to the ambiguous nature of the problem, each
sample of the generative model encodes a different explanation of the object’s materials, geometry
and the input illumination. However, as opposed to optimization-based inverse rendering, such
samples are all plausible relit images since they are the output of the trained diffusion model.

Instead of attempting to recover a single explanation of the underlying object’s appearance, we sample
multiple plausible relit images for each observed viewpoint, and treat the underlying explanations as
samples of unobserved latent variables. To recover a final consistent 3D representation of the relit
object, we use the full set of sampled relit images from all viewpoints to train a “latent NeRF” that
reconciles all the samples into a single 3D representation, which can be rendered to produce plausible
relit images from novel viewpoints.

The key contribution of our work is a new paradigm for relightable 3D reconstruction that replaces
3D inverse rendering with: generating samples with a single-image 2D Relighting Diffusion Model
followed by distilling these samples into a 3D latent NeRF representation. We demonstrate that this
strategy is surprisingly competitive and outperforms existing most 3D inverse rendering baselines on
the TensoIR [23] and Stanford-ORB [27] relighting and view synthesis benchmarks.

Related Work

Our work addresses the task of relightable 3D reconstruction by using a lighting-conditioned diffusion
model as a generative prior for single-image relighting. It is closely related to prior work in relightable
3D reconstruction, inverse rendering, and single-image relighting. Below, we review these lines of
work and discuss how they relate to our proposed approach.

Relightable 3D Reconstruction
The goal of relightable 3D reconstruction is to reconstruct a 3D
representation of an object that can be relit by novel illumination conditions and rendered from novel
camera poses. In scenarios where an object is observed under multiple lighting conditions [12], it is
trivial to render its appearance under novel illumination that is a linear combination of the observed
lighting conditions, due to the linear behavior of light. This approach is generally limited to laboratory
capture scenarios where it is possible to observe an object under a lighting basis.

In more casual capture scenarios, the object is observed under just a single or a small handful of
lighting conditions. Existing works typically address this setting using methods based on inverse
rendering that explicitly factor an object’s appearance into the underlying 3D geometry, object
material properties, and lighting that jointly explain the observed images. State-of-the-art approaches
to 3D inverse rendering [9, 10, 17, 23, 26, 33, 38, 46, 47] generally utilize the following strategy: they
start with a neural field representation of 3D geometry (typically volume density as in NeRF [36],
hybrid volume-surface representations as in NeuS [57] and VolSDF [59], or meshes extracted from
neural field representations) from the input images, equip the model with a representation of surface
materials (e.g. spatially-varying BRDF parameters) and lighting, and jointly optimize these factors
through a differentiable physics-based rendering procedure [40]. While methods may differ in
their choice of geometry, material, and lighting representations, and employ different techniques
to accelerate the evaluation of the rendering integral, they generally all follow this same high-
level inverse rendering strategy. Unfortunately, even if the geometry is known, inverse rendering

is a notoriously ambiguous problem [43, 52] and many combinations of materials and lighting
can explain an object’s appearance. However, not all of these combinations are plausible, and
incorrect factorizations that explain observed images under one lighting condition may produce
glaring artifacts when rendered under different lighting. Furthermore, differentiable physics-based
rendering is computationally-expensive as thousands of samples are needed for Monte Carlo estimates
of the rendering integral, typically requires custom implementations [2, 3, 22, 28, 32, 35, 54], and
the resulting inverse rendering loss landscape is non-smooth and difficult to optimize effectively with
gradient descent [14].

Single Image Relighting
Instead of using inverse rendering to recover object material parameters
which can be relit with physically-based rendering techniques, we train a diffusion model that can
directly sample from the distribution of relit images conditioned on a target lighting condition.
This diffusion model is essentially a generative single-image relighting model. Early single image
relighting techniques employed optimization-based inverse rendering [4]. Subsequent methods
trained deep convolutional neural networks to output image geometry, materials, and lighting [29, 30],
or in some cases, to directly output relit images [48, 7, 8].

Most related to our method are a few recent works that have trained diffusion models for single image
relighting. LightIt [25] trains a model similar to ControlNet [63] to relight outdoor images under
arbitrary sun positions conditioned on input normals and shading. DiffusionLight [41] estimates the
lighting of an image by using a ControlNet to inpaint the color pixels of a chrome ball in the middle
of the scene, from which an environment map can be recovered.

Most similar to our work is the concurrent method of DiLightNet [61] that focuses on single image
relighting. DiLightNet uses a ControlNet-based [63] approach to condition a single-image relighting
diffusion model on a target environment map. DiLightNet uses a set of “radiance cues” [15] —
renderings of the object’s geometry (obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular depth network) with
various roughness levels under the target environment illumination — as conditioning. Our method
instead focuses on 3D relighting, where multiple of images of an object are available. It uses a similar
single-image relighting diffusion model conditioned on radiance cues. Unlike DiLightNet which uses
geometry from monocular depth estimation to render radiance cues, we use geometry estimated from
the input views using a state-of-the-art surface reconstruction method [56]. This allows our model to
better model complex light transport effects such as interreflections caused by occluded geometry.

Problem Formulation

Given a dataset of images of an object and corresponding camera poses D = {(Ii, πi)}N
i=1, the
general goal of relightable 3D reconstruction is to estimate a model with parameters θ that when
rendered, produces relit versions of the dataset under unobserved target illumination LT . This can be
expressed as:
θ⋆= argmax
θ
p(DT
θ |D),
(1)

where DT
θ ≜
 
relight(D, LT , πi, θ), πi
	N
i=1 is a relit version of the original dataset under target
illumination LT using model θ. Note that Eq. (1) only maximizes the likelihood of the original given
poses after relighting. However, by using view synthesis, we can then turn the collection of relit
images into a 3D representation which can be rendered from arbitrary poses. For brevity, we therefore
omit the implicit dependence of DT in θ.

This relighting problem has traditionally been solved by using inverse rendering. Inverse rendering
techniques do not maximize the probability of the relit renderings, but instead recover a single point
estimate of the most likely scene geometry G, materials M, and lighting L (note that this is the
“source” lighting condition for the observed images) that together explain the input dataset, and then
use physically-based rendering to relight this factorized explanation under the target lighting. Inverse
rendering seeks to recover θIR = (G⋆, M ⋆), where:

G⋆, M ⋆, L⋆= argmax
G,M,L
p(G, M, L|D) = argmax
G,M,L
p(D|G, M, L)p(G, M, L).

3D geometry as in (b). Based on this geometry and a target light shown in (c), we create radiance
cues for each given input view as in (d). Next, we independently relight each input image using a
single-image Relighting Diffusion Model illustrated in (e) and sample S possible solutions for each
given view displayed in (f). Finally, we distill the relit set of images into a 3D representation through
a Latent NeRF optimization as in (g) and (h).

The first data likelihood term is computed by physics-based rendering of the estimated model and the
second prior term is often factorized into separate handcrafted priors on geometry, materials, and
lighting [23, 33, 43].

A relighting approach based on inverse rendering then renders each image I in D corresponding to
camera pose π using the recovered geometry and materials, illuminated by the target lighting LT ,
resulting in relight(D, LT , π, θIR). This approach has three main issues. First, the differentiable
rendering procedures used to compute the gradient of the likelihood term are computationally-
expensive. Second, it requires careful modeling of light transport which is cumbersome and existing
differentiable renderers do not account for many types of lighting and material effects seen in the
real world. Third, there are often ambiguities between M and L, meaning that any errors in their
decomposition may be apparent in the relit data. It is quite difficult to design effective handcrafted
priors on geometry, materials, and lighting, so inverse rendering procedures frequently recover
explanations that have a high data likelihood (are able to render the observed data) but produce clearly
incorrect results when re-rendered under different illumination.

3.2
Model Overview

We propose an approach that attempts to maximize the probability of relit images in Eq. (1) without
using an explicit physically-based model of the object’s lighting or materials. First, let us introduce a
latent variable Z that can be thought of as implicitly representing the input images’ lighting along
with the object’s material and geometry parameters. We can write the likelihood of the relit data as:

p(DT |D) =
Z
p(DT , Z|D)dZ =
Z
p(DT |Z, D)p(Z|D)dZ.
(3)

Introducing these latent variables lets us consider all relit renderings in the dataset, DT
i ≜(IT
i , πi),
as conditionally independent, since the rendering under the target lighting LT is deterministic given
the object’s geometry and materials. This enables writing the likelihood as:

p(DT |D) =
Z " N
Y

i=1
p(DT
i |Zi, Di)

#

|
{z
}
latent NeRF

p(Z|D)

| {z }
latent prior

dZ.
(4)

We propose to model this with a latent NeRF model, as used by Martin-Brualla et al. [34] that is able
to render novel views under the target illumination for any sampled latent vector. We describe this
model in Sec. 3.3. We train this NeRF model by generating a large quantity of sampled relit images
with the same target lighting but with different (unknown) latent vectors using a Relighting Diffusion
Model which we will describe in Sec. 3.4. In this way, the latent NeRF model effectively distills a
large dataset of relit images sampled by the diffusion model into a single 3D representation that can
render novel views of the object under the target lighting for any sampled latent.

for a fixed value of the latent. The diffusion samples correspond to different latent explanations of
the scene and our latent NeRF optimization is able to effectively optimize these latent variables along
with the NeRF model’s parameters to produce consistent renderings for each latent explanation.

3.3
Latent NeRF Model

We wish to model the distribution in Eq. (4) in a manner that lets us render images that correspond to
relit views of the object for any sampled latent Z. We choose to model this with a latent code NeRF
3D representation, inspired by prior works that condition NeRFs on latent codes to represent sources
of variation such as the time of day during capture [34]. This latent NeRF optimizes a set of latent
codes that are used to condition the view-dependent color function represented by the NeRF, enabling
it to render novel views of the relit object under the target illumination for any sampled latent code.
In our implementation, the latent NeRF’s geometry does not depend on the latent code, so the latent
code may be interpreted as only representing the object’s material properties.

To optimize the parameters θ of the latent NeRF model, we maximize the log-likelihood, which by
using Eq. (4), can be written as the following maximization problem:

θ⋆= argmax
θ
log p(DT
θ |D) = argmax
θ
log
Z " N
Y

i=1
p(DT
i |Zi, Di)

#

p(Z|D)dZ.
(5)

Because integrating over all possible latents Z is intractable, we use a heuristic inference strategy
and replace the integral with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of Z:

θ⋆≈argmax
θ
max
Z

( N
X

i=1
log p(DT
i |Zi, Di) + log p(Z|D)

)

.
(6)

By assuming a Gaussian model over the data given the materials, the first term in Eq. (6) is a
reconstruction loss over the images. However, since we do not have access to the true latent vector Z,
we assume a uniform prior over them, turning the second term in Eq. (6) into a constant. In practice,
similar to prior work on NeRFs optimized to generate new views given a dataset containing images
with varying appearance, we rely on the NeRF model to resolve any mismatches in the appearance of
different images [34]. See Fig. 3 for illustrations. The minimization of the negative log-likelihood
can then be written as:

θ⋆= arg min
θ
min
Z

N

i=1
∥DT
i −latent-NeRF(θ, Zi, πi)∥2.

Relighting Diffusion Model

In order to train the latent NeRF model described in Sec. 3.3, we use a Relighting Diffusion Model
(RDM) to generate S samples for each viewpoint from p(DT
i |Di). In other words, given an input
image and target lighting LT , the single-image RDM samples S images corresponding to relit

versions of Di that have a high likelihood given the new target light LT . We then associate each
sample s ∈{1, . . . , S} with its own latent code Zi,s and sum over all samples when training the
latent NeRF (Eq. (7)).

Our RDM is implemented as an image denoising diffusion model that is conditioned by the input
image and target lighting. To encode the target lighting, we use image-space radiance cues [15, 44, 61],
visualized in Fig. 4. These radiance cues are generated by using a simple shading model to render
a handful of images of the object’s estimated geometry under the target lighting. This procedure is
designed to provide information about the effects of specularities, shadows, and global illumination,
without requiring the diffusion network to learn these effects from scratch. In our experiments, we
use four different pre-defined materials to render radiance cues: one diffuse material with a pure
white albedo, and three purely-specular materials with roughness values {0.05, 0.13, 0.34}. We use
GGX [55] as the shading model. For more details, please refer to Sec. A.2.

The RDM architecture consists of a pretrained latent image diffusion model, similar to StableDiffu-
sion [45], and uses a ControlNet [63] based approach to condition on the radiance cues. Please refer
to Sec. A.3 for more architecture details.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental Setup

Relighting Dataset
We render objects from Objaverse [13] under varying poses and illuminations.
For each object, we randomly sample 4 poses, and render each under 4 different lighting conditions.
We represent the lighting as HDR environment maps, and randomly sample from a dataset of 509
environment maps from Polyhaven [60]. For more details, see Sec. A.4.

Evaluation Datasets
We evaluate our method on two datasets: TensoIR [23], a synthetic benchmark,
and Stanford-ORB [27], a real-world benchmark. TensoIR contains renderings of four synthetic
objects rendered under six lighting conditions. Following [23], we use the training split of 100
renderings with “sunset” lighting as input {Ii}. We then evaluate on 200 poses, each of which has
renderings under five different environment maps, i.e., “bridge”, “city”, “fireplace”, “forest”, and
“night”, for a total of 4000 renderings. Stanford-ORB is a real-world benchmark for inverse rendering
on data captured in the wild. It contains 14 objects with various materials and captures each object
under three different lighting settings, resulting in 42 (object, lighting) pairs. For the task of relighting,
we are given images of an object under a single lighting condition and follow the benchmark protocol
to evaluate relit images of the object under the two target lighting settings.

Baselines
We compare our method to several existing inverse rendering approaches. On both
benchmarks, we compare to NeRFactor [65] and InvRender [66]. On the synthetic benchmark, we
additionally compare to TensoIR [23], the current top-performing approach on that benchmark. For
the Stanford-ORB benchmark, we additionally compare to PhySG [62], NVDiffRec [38], NeRD [10],
NVDiffRecMC [17], and Neural-PBIR [47].

Our Model Inference
At inference time, the ideal embedding vector Z that best corresponds to the
actual material is unknown. One approach to find this vector is to optimize Z to match a subset of
the test set images (as in [34]). However, to ensure a fair comparison, we avoid this optimization.
Instead, we set Z = 0 for all views when rendering test images.

specular highlights and colors as indicated in red.

Evaluation Metrics
For both benchmarks, we evaluate the quality of 3D relighting by reporting
image metrics for rendered images. We report PSNR, SSIM [58], and LPIPS-VGG [64] on low
dynamic range (LDR) images. Additionally, we report PSNR on high dynamic range (HDR) images
on Stanford-ORB following the benchmark protocol, denoted as PSNR-H while the PSNR on LDR
images is marked as PSNR-L. For approaches that do not produce HDR renderings, including ours,
we convert the LDR renderings to linear values by using the inverse of the sRGB tone mapping curve.
Due to the inherent ambiguities for the relighting task, we follow prior works [23, 27] and apply a
channel-wise scale factor to RGB channels to match the ground truth image before computing metrics.
Following established evaluation practices on Stanford-ORB, we compute the scale per output image
individually whereas for TensoIR we compute a global scale factor that is used for all output images.2

Benchmarking

Unless otherwise specified, all results are produced using S = 16 samples (see Sec. 3.4) and make
use of 16 A100 40GB GPUs (batch size of 214 rays for NeRF optimization). We also provide results
on a single A100 40GB GPU (batch size of 213 for NeRF optimization).

We report quantitative results on the TensoIR benchmark in Tab. 1, and show qualitative examples
in Fig. 5. We significantly outperform all competitors quantitatively on all metrics with comparable or
improved wall-clock time. Visually our method is capable of recovering specular highlights whereas
prior methods struggle to model these.

Similarly, we report results on Stanford-ORB in Tab. 2 and Fig. 6. Our proposed approach quantita-
tively improves upon all baselines, except those of Neural-PBIR [47], indicating the effectiveness of
IllumiNeRF in real world scenarios. Note that although Neural-PBIR achieves better metrics than us,
Fig. 6 shows that their relighting results are mostly diffuse, even for highly-glossy objects, and that
they lack many of the strong specular highlights that our method is able to recover. This behavior
of their model may explain their better metrics despite worse qualitative performance for specular
highlights, because the illumination maps provided by Stanford-ORB do not correspond to the

moved for each image in the dataset [27]. This means that even given perfect materials and geometry,
the images relit by any method cannot match with the true captured images, which is most noticeable
in specular highlights. This mismatch penalizes methods like ours, which recover such specularities,
over ones that recover mostly diffuse appearance with no apparent specular highlights [52]. For a

(RDM) sample and 2) two latent NeRF renderings using the sample’s latent code. The diffusion
samples are selected uniformly from all N (#views) × S (#samples per view) diffusion generations.
Each row shows results from the same object and lighting with latent codes capturing various plausible
explanations of the materials.

Ablations

We evaluate ablations of our model on TensoIR’s hotdog scene in Tab. 3, and visualize them in Fig. 8.
We reach the following conclusions: 1) The latent NeRF model is essential: optimizing a standard
NeRF cannot reconcile variations across views, even if we only generate a single sample per viewpoint
for optimization (S = 1). 2) More diffusion samples help: by increasing S, the number of samples
from the RDM per viewpoint, we observe consistent improvements across almost all metrics. This
corroborates our intuition that using an increased number of samples helps the latent NeRF effectively
fit the target distribution (Eq. (4)) in a more stable way.

evaluate renderings of 200 novel test camera poses, each under five target environment map lighting
conditions, resulting in evaluating 1000 renderings in total. Best is highlighted.

Figure 8: Using a standard NeRF instead of a latent NeRF model is unable to reconcile training
samples with different underlying latent explanations. Using a latent NeRF model significantly
increases the accuracy of rendered specular appearance, and increasing the number of samples S from
the RDM used to train the latent NeRF model further increases the quality of the output renderings.

4.4
Limitations

Our model relies on high quality geometry estimated by UniSDF [56] (see Sec. A.1) to provide
sufficiently good radiance cues for conditioning the RDM (Sec. 3.4) . Any missing structure will lead
our model to miss specular reflections, as seen on the top left of the salt can result in Fig. 6’s second
column. Errors in geometry also affect the quality of synthesized novel views, e.g. the missing thin
branches from the plant in Fig. 5 or fine details of the cactus (column 4) in Fig. 6. Note that our
RDM, trained on high-quality synthetic geometry, will inherently improve with future advances in
geometry reconstruction. Our approach is not suited for real-time relighting, as it requires generating
new samples with the RDM and optimizing a NeRF for any new target lighting condition.

Conclusion

We have proposed a new paradigm for the task of relightable 3D reconstruction. Instead of decom-
posing an object’s appearance into lighting and material factors and then relighting the object with
physically-based rendering, we use a single-image Relighting Diffusion Model (RDM) to sample
a varied collection of proposed relit images given a target illumination, and distill these samples
into a single consistent 3D latent NeRF representation. This 3D representation can be rendered to
synthesize novel views of the object under the target lighting. Perhaps surprisingly, this paradigm
consistently outperforms existing inverse rendering methods on synthetic and real-world object
relighting benchmarks. This new paradigm’s success is likely due to the RDM’s ability to generate a
large number of proposals for the new relit images. This is in contrast to prior works based on inverse
rendering, which first estimates a single material model and then uses it for relighting, since errors in
material estimation may propagate to the relit images. We believe that this paradigm may be used to
improve data capture, material and lighting estimation, and that it may be used to do so robustly on
real-world data.

Appendix – IllumiNeRF: 3D Relighting Without Inverse Rendering

This appendix is organized as follows:

1. Sec. A provides more implementation details;

2. Sec. B details the inconsistent illumination issue on Stanford-ORB.

A
Additional Implementation Details

A.1
Latent NeRF Model and Geometry Estimator

We use JAX [11] to implement both the geometry estimator and Latent NeRF model as UniSDF [56], a
state-of-the-art volume rendering approach based on a signed distance function (SDF). The advantage
of using UniSDF is that it enables easily extracting a mesh from the SDF, which we can then import
into a standard rendering engine such as Blender [50] in order to compute radiance cues. Additionally,
UniSDF decouples geometry from appearance, allowing us to fix the weights related to geometry and
only optimize for weights that model the appearance. Note that future NeRF/SDF approaches with
improved geometric reconstruction can be seamlessly integrated in our method.

Our parameterization of the UniSDF model is similar to the one used in the original paper for the
DTU dataset [1], with four key changes. First, we reduce the number of rounds of proposal sampling
(as introduced by mip-NeRF 360 [5]) from two to one, using 64 proposal samples. Second, we use
the asymmetric predicted normal loss from NeRF-Casting [53]:

Lp =

λ1ωi∥ 
∇ni − 
∇n′
i∥2+ λ2 
∇ωi∥ni − 
∇n′
i∥2 + λ3 
∇ωi∥ 
∇ni −n′
i∥2
,
(S1)

where ωi is the volume rendering weight of the i-th sample,  
∇denotes the stop-gradient operator,
ni and n′
i are the i-th sample’s density normals and predicted normals respectively (see [51]), and
we set λ1 = λ2 = 10−3, λ3 = 10−2. Third, like NeRF-Casting [53], we use an additional hash grid
encoding [37] with 15 scales between a resolution of 32 and 4096, used only for outputting predicted
normals. Fourth, we further encourage the local smoothness of the predicted normals n′ by using a
smoothness loss similar to [39, 65]:

Ls = λ4
X

i
ωi∥n′(xi + ε) −n′(xi)∥2,
(S2)

where xi is the 3D position of the i-th sample, and ε ∼N(0, σ2I) is an isotropic Gaussian random
variable used to perturb the sample locations. We set λ4 = 0.1 and σ = 0.01.

We find that these modifications result in better and smoother geometry necessary for our model’s
ability to relight objects with specular highlights.

Finally, to incorporate the GLO embeddings, we utilize an MLP to predict an element-wise scale and
shift value to be applied to the ‘bottleneck’ feature of UniSDF, similar to AffineGLO in Zip-NeRF [6].

For both geometry estimation and latent NeRF optimization, we utilize the Adam [24] optimizer with
β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.99, and ε = 1 × 10−15. We decay our learning rate logarithmically from 5 × 10−3
to 5 × 10−4 over 25k training iterations with cosine-scheduled warmup in the first 500 steps.

A.2
Radiance Cues

Geometry
To extract radiance cues we first optimize UniSDF [56] on the input images. After
optimization, we convert the SDF representation to a mesh using marching cubes [31] with threshold
set to be zero.

Rendering
We use Blender Cycles [50], a physically-based path-tracer to render the radiance cues.
We run Blender via the Kubric python wrapper [16], and we use the estimated geometry with the
predefined materials based on the GGX material model [55], as described in Sec. 3.4.

Shading Normals
In order to produce smoothly-varying specular highlights which look realistic,
we need the normals used for shading to be smooth. By default, Blender computes normals for
shading based on the input geometry, which may be noisy. To mitigate this, we can feed the predicted
normals n′ described in Sec. A.1 to Blender and enable its shading normal smoothing function which
applies to the predicted normals, and uses them for shading. However, over-smoothness may harm
the photorealism of the rendered shadows. See Fig. S1 for qualitative comparison on radiance cues
rendered without enabling the shading normal smoothing (Fig. S1a) and with the feature enabled
(Fig. S1b). In our implementation, we exploit a hybrid strategy: we utilize radiance cues without
smoothness for the diffuse material and use radiance cues with smoothness for the specular materials.
Concretely, our final radiance cues are composed of the first rendering in Fig. S1a and the right three
ones in Fig. S1b.

A.3
Relighting Diffusion Model

We implement our relighting diffusion model in JAX [11]. We illustrate the architecture of the model
for inference in Fig. S2. We build upon a text-to-image latent diffusion model which is similar to the
model of Rombach et al. [45]. It denoises gaussian noise of size 64 × 64 × 8 and decodes the output
latent features into a relit image of size 512 × 512 × 3. The model was not conditioned on text input,
receiving only empty strings via a CLIP text encoder [42]. During training the base model is frozen.

Following ControlNet [63], we create a trainable copy of the base diffusion model’s UNet encoder
and middle blocks and append them with a ZeroConv-based blocks to the frozen base model. The

given masked image and radiance cues are first fed through ConvNet 2 (see Fig. 4 in [61] for details)
and ConvNet 3 (see Tab. S2). The resulting output is added to the output of the latent noise, which is
fed through ConvNet 4. ConvNet 4 consists of a single convolution layer with kernel size 3, stride
1, padding 1, and 320 output channels. Given that the trainable copy was designed for tokenized
text input, the masked image is first fed through ConvNet 1 (see Tab. S1) to generate representative
embeddings. To ensure compatibility between the output of ConvNet 1 (size 64) and the CLIP [42]
encoder’s text output shape, zero-valued tensors are appended, increasing the size to 77.

We train the diffusion model using an approach similar to ControlNet [63], with a large dataset of
synthetic objects rendered under multiple lighting conditions. Each training example for fine-tuning
consists of a pair of images that view the same object with the same camera parameters, illuminated
by two different environment map (see Sec. A.4). We fine-tune the diffusion model to predict one
of these two images, given the other image as well as the corresponding radiance cues rendered
using the synthetic object’s geometry. Note that for synthetic objects, we do not need to estimate the
geometry G nor to enable the Blender normal smoothing function to compute the radiance cues since
we already have the ground-truth meshes and the normals from synthetic objects are smooth enough.
We fine-tune the base model for 150k steps using batch size of 512 examples and a learning rate of
10−4, which is linearly warmed up from 0 over the first 1k steps. The fine-tuning takes around 2 days
on 32 TPUv5 chips. Besides, we always use the empty string as the text input to effectively make the
fine-tuned model image-based.

At inference time, we use the DPPM scheduler [21] without classifier-free guidance [20] to produce
samples at 512 × 512 resolution.

A.4
Training Data Processing

We use Objaverse [13] as the synthetic dataset. To filter out low-quality objects, we use the list
from [49] to get our initial set of 156,330 ones.4 By additionally removing (semi-)transparent ones,
we have a final set of 152,649 objects. If the object only contains geometry, we manually assign
a homogeneous texture (ShaderNodeBsdfDiffuse) with a color uniformly sampled from [0, 1]3.
Further, if the object does not have the material information, we assign it a Blender Glossy BSDF

Figure S3: Stanford-ORB’s per-image illuminations from teapot_scene002: inconsistent sun and
tripod shape/location.

Table S3: Issues on illuminations of Stanford-ORB [27]. We create two sets of reference renderings
with the ground-truth geometry and material: 1) using a fixed illumination to render all evaluation
images for a same (object, lighting) pair; and 2) using the per-image illumination provided by the
benchmark. We then evaluate each approach’s renderings with respect to the two sets of reference
renderings respectively. We also list each approach’s illumination selection in the second column.
For each row, better performance between the two evaluations is highlighted . Apparently and
consistently, the numerical results favor matched illumination selection.

material (ShaderNodeBsdfGlossy), whose roughness value is uniformly sampled from [0.02, 0.5]
and base color is set to be the same as the homogeneous texture. The mixing factor between the
specular and diffuse materials (ShaderNodeMixShader) is uniformaly sampled from [0, 1].

As we discussed in Sec. A.3, our diffusion training requires image pairs under different lightings. For
this, we select 509 equirectangular environment maps from [60]. For each object, we sample four
camera poses on a sphere centered around it. For each camera, we randomly sample two environment
maps and augment them with random horizontal shift, vertical flip, and RGB channel shuffle. We
then use Blender’s Cycle path tracer to render an image of resolution 512 × 512 with 512 samples
per pixel for each environment map using a camera whose focal length is set to be 512.

B
Stanford-ORB Illumination Issues

Stanford-ORB provides estimated per-image illumination via moving a light probe for each image,
see Fig. S3 for an example. Ideally, fixed illumination per object would match reality, but aligning
the object and light probe is challenging. This limitation in the Stanford-ORB benchmark can
significantly affect results, especially in areas with specular highlights as demonstrated in Tab. S3.
Consequently, there is no “correct” way to do relighting in Stanford-ORB: our results use fixed
illumination, while competitors use per-image illumination.

We rendered the ground truth geometry and materials, obtained by Stanford-ORB in a controlled stu-
dio environment (see [27]’s Sec.3.2.2). Each view was rendered under fixed illumination (consistent
environment map) and per-image illumination (unique environment map per view). Fig. S4 shows
both renderings alongside the corresponding real image. Note the significant variations, especially in
areas with specular highlights (see marked regions and PSNR).

2) reference rendering w/ per-image illumination” (see Tab. S3 caption for details); and 3) the real
captured image. We show PSNR-L between 1) vs. 3) and 2) vs. 3) respectively. Different illumination
settings vary significantly.

We computed metrics for each method using both reference renderings as ground truth whose
quantative results are in Tab. S3. Our method excels under fixed illumination but performs worse
with per-image illumination. Competitors show the opposite trend, doing better with per-image
illumination. Neural-PBIR did not release code or complete results, thus it is missing from the table.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

The claims about performance are verified by an extensive quantitative and qualitative
analysis as described in the experiments section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: We discuss the limitations of our method in the limitations section. Most
notably our method bakes in material and target lighting into the NeRF, i.e. for each target
light our method needs to optimize a new NeRF model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have any theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We attempted to provide all necessary information to reproduce the results.
We provide detailed insights into dataset and radiance cue generation, model architectures,
hyperparameters and model training in the supplemental.

20


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We have not made the code or model weights available online, however, the
Objaverse dataset is publicly available as well as the datasets required for the Stanford-ORB
and TensoIR benchmarks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

21


---Page Break---
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide information about model training, hyperparameters, optimizer
and learning rates in the appendix. For the evaluation we use the data splits defined by the
benchmarks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We evaluate our method against the most popular benchmarks which do not
report error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For both diffusion model training and NeRF optimization we provide the
compute requirements in the appendix.

22


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: To the best of our knowledge we follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We propose a novel paradigm for an existing task — 3D relighting. If reviewers
believe our method could cause potential harm, we are happy to include a statement.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]

Justification: We do not plan to release our trained models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite the works that provide the assets used for data set generation, as well
as the use of pre-trained model weights in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, we explain how we render 3D assets in the appendix section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose

---Page Break---
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We did not conduct research with humans or crowdsourced any tasks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No studies were undertaken.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
