Abstract

In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and
mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL)
Divergence loss that consists of 1) a weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) loss
and 2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decomposed
formulation of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly,
we address the limitation of KL/DKL in scenarios like knowledge distillation
by breaking its asymmetric optimization property. This modification ensures
that the wMSE component is always effective during training, providing extra
constructive cues. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into
KL/DKL to mitigate bias from individual samples. With these two enhancements,
we derive the Improved Kullback–Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss and evaluate
its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet
datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. The
proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the
public leaderboard — RobustBench and competitive performance on knowledge
distillation, demonstrating the substantial practical merits. Our code is available at

Introduction

Loss functions are a critical component of training deep models. Cross-Entropy loss is particularly
important in image classification tasks [28, 55, 59, 20, 44, 12], while Mean Square Error (MSE)
loss is commonly used in regression tasks [51, 27, 25]. Contrastive loss [7, 26, 8, 23, 4, 16, 17]
has emerged as a popular objective for representation learning. The selection of an appropriate loss
function can exert a substantial influence on a model’s performance. Therefore, the development of
effective loss functions [3, 43, 73, 63, 36, 2, 65, 58, 15] remains a critical research topic in the fields
of computer vision and machine learning.

Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence quantifies the degree of dissimilarity between a probability
distribution and a reference distribution. As one of the most frequently used loss functions, it
finds application in various scenarios, such as adversarial training [71, 66, 14, 35], knowledge
distillation [33, 6, 73], incremental learning [5, 42], and robustness on out-of-distribution data [29].
Although many of these studies incorporate KL Divergence loss as part of their algorithms, they may
not thoroughly investigate the underlying mechanisms of the loss function. To bridge this gap, our
paper aims to elucidate the working mechanism of KL Divergence regarding gradient optimization.

Our study focuses on the analysis of Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence loss from the perspective of
gradient optimization. For models with softmax activation, we provide theoretical proof that it is equiv-
alent to the Decoupled Kullback–Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss which comprises a weighted Mean
Square Error (wMSE) loss and a Cross-Entropy loss with soft labels. Figures 1(a) and (b) reveal the
equivalence between KL and DKL losses regarding gradient backpropagation. With the decomposed
formulation, it becomes more convenient to analyze how the KL loss works in training optimization.

loss is equivalent to KL loss regarding backward optimization. M and N can be the same one (like in
adversarial training) or two separate (like in knowledge distillation) models determined by application
scenarios. Similarly, xm, xn ∈X can also be the same one (like in knowledge distillation) or two
different (like in adversarial training) images. om, on are logits output with which the probability
vectors are obtained when applying the softmax activation. Black arrows represent the forward process

We have identified potential issues of KL loss with the newly
derived DKL loss. Specifically, its gradient optimization
is asymmetric regarding the inputs. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 1(b), the gradients on om and on are asymmetric and
driven by the wMSE and Cross-Entropy individually. This
optimization asymmetry can lead to the wMSE component
being ignored in certain scenarios, such as knowledge dis-
tillation where om is the logits of the teacher model and
detached from gradient backpropagation. Fortunately, it is
convenient to address this issue with the decoupled formu-
lation of DKL loss by breaking the asymmetric optimization
property. As evidenced by Figure 1(c), enabling gradient on
on from wMSE alleviates this problem.

Moreover, wMSE component is guided by sample-wise pre-
dictions. Hard examples with incorrect prediction scores can
lead to challenging optimization. We thus insert class-wise
global information to regularize the training process. Inte-
grating DKL with these two points, we derive the Improved
Kullback–Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IKL loss, we evaluate it with adversarial training
and knowledge distillation tasks. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet show
that the IKL loss achieves new state-of-the-art robustness on the public leaderboard of RobustBench 1.
Comparisons with previous methods on adversarial robustness are shown in Figure 2.

In summary, the main contributions of our work are:

• We reveal that the KL loss is mathematically equivalent to a composite of a weighted MSE
(wMSE) loss and a Cross-Entropy loss employing soft labels.

• Based on our analysis, we propose two modifications for enhancement: breaking its asym-
metric optimization and incorporating class-wise global information, deriving the Improved
Kullback–Leibler (IKL) loss.

• With the proposed IKL loss, we obtain the state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on Robust-
Bench and competitive knowledge distillation performance on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet.

Related Work

Adversarial Robustness. Since the identification of adversarial examples by Szegedy et al. [57], the
security of deep neural networks (DNNs) has gained significant attention, and ensuring the reliability
of DNNs has become a prominent topic in the machine learning community. Adversarial training [46],
being the most effective method, stands out due to its consistently high performance.

Adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into the training process. Madary et al. [46]
propose the adoption of the universal first-order adversary, specifically the PGD attack, in adversarial
training. Zhang et al. [71] trade off the accuracy and robustness by the KL loss. Wu et al. [66] intro-
duce adversarial weight perturbation to explicitly regulate the flatness of the weight loss landscape.
Cui et al. [14] leverage guidance from naturally-trained models to regularize the decision boundary in
adversarial training. Additionally, various other techniques [35] focusing on optimization or training
aspects have also been developed. Besides, recently, several works [22, 64, 1] have explored the use
of data augmentation techniques to improve adversarial training. We have explored the mechanism of
KL loss for adversarial robustness in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed IKL loss is tested
in both settings with and without synthesized data [38].

Knowledge Distillation. The concept of Knowledge Distillation (KD) was first introduced by Hinton
et al. [33]. It involves extracting “dark knowledge” from accurate teacher models to guide the
learning process of student models. This is achieved by utilizing the KL loss to regularize the output
probabilities of student models, aligning them with those of their teacher models when given the same
inputs. This simple yet effective technique significantly improves the generalization ability of smaller
models and finds extensive applications in various domains. Since the initial success of KD [33],
several advanced methods, including logits-based [9, 21, 48, 67, 72, 73, 34] and features-based
approaches [53, 61, 30, 70, 6, 31, 32, 39, 49, 50, 68], have been introduced. This paper decouples
the KL loss into a new formulation, i.e., DKL, and addresses the limitation of KL loss for application
scenarios like knowledge distillation.

Other Applications of KL Divergence Loss. In semi-supervised learning, the KL loss acts as a
consistency loss between the outputs of weakly and strongly augmented images [56, 60]. In continual
learning, KL loss helps retain previous knowledge by encouraging consistency between the outputs
of pre-trained and newly updated models [5, 42]. Additionally, KL loss is also applied to enhance
model robustness to out-of-distribution data [29, 74, 76].

Method

In this section, we begin by introducing the preliminary mathematical notations in Section 3.1.
Theoretical analysis of the equivalence between KL and DKL losses is presented in Section 3.2.
Finally, we propose the IKL loss to address potential limitations of KL/DKL in Section 3.3, followed
by a case study with additional analysis in Section 3.4.

3.1
Preliminary

Definition of KL Divergence. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence measures the differences between
two probability distributions. For distributions P and Q of a continuous random variable, It is defined
to be the integral:

DKL(P||Q) =
Z +∞

−∞
p(x) ∗log p(x)

q(x)dx,
(1)

where p and q denote the probability densities of P and Q.

The KL loss is one of the most widely used objectives in deep learning, applied across various
contexts involving categorical distributions. This paper primarily examines its role in adversarial
training and knowledge distillation tasks.

In adversarial training, the KL loss improves model robustness by aligning the output probability
distribution of adversarial examples with that of their corresponding clean images, thus minimizing
output changes despite input perturbations. In knowledge distillation, the KL loss enables a student
model to mimic the behavior of a teacher model, facilitating knowledge transfer that enhances the
student model’s generalization performance.

Applications of KL Loss in Deep Learning. We consider image classification models that predict
probability vectors using the softmax activation. Let oi ∈RC represent the logits output from a model
given an input image xi ∈X, where C denotes the number of classes. The predicted probability
vector is si ∈RC, computed as si = softmax(oi). The values oj
i and sj
i correspond to the logits
and probabilities for the j-th class, respectively. The KL loss is often used to encourage similarity
between sm and sn in various scenarios, resulting in the following objective:

LKL(xm, xn) =

C
X

j=1
sj
m ∗log sj
m
sj
n
.
(2)

For example, in adversarial training, xm represents a clean image, while xn is its corresponding
adversarial example. In knowledge distillation, xm and xn are the same image, but they are input
separately to the teacher and student models. Notably, in the knowledge distillation process, sm is
detached from gradient backpropagation, as the teacher model is pre-trained and fixed during training.

3.2
Decoupled Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss

Previous works [33, 73, 71, 14] have incorporated the KL loss into their algorithms without inves-
tigating its underlying mechanism. This paper aims to uncover the driving force behind gradient
optimization by analyzing the KL loss function. With the backpropagation rule in training optimiza-
tion, the derivative gradients are as follows,

∂LKL

∂oj
m
=

C
X

k=1
((∆mj,k −∆nj,k) ∗(sk

=

n −sj
m,
(4)

where ∆mj,k = oj

m, and ∆nj,k = oj
n −ok
n.

Leveraging the antiderivative technique alongside the structured gradient information, we introduce
a novel formulation called the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss, as presented
in Theorem 1. The DKL loss is designed to be equivalent to the KL loss while offering a more
analytically tractable alternative for further exploration and study.

Theorem 1 From the perspective of gradient optimization, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence
loss is equivalent to the following Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss when α = 1
and β = 1.

Interpretation. With Theorem 1, we know that KL loss is equivalent to DKL loss regarding gradient
optimization, i.e., DKL loss produces the same gradients as KL loss given the same inputs. Therefore,
KL loss can be interpreted as a composition of a wMSE loss and a Cross-Entropy loss. This is the
first work to reveal the precise quantitative relationships between KL, Cross-Entropy, and MSE losses.
Upon examining this new formulation, we identify two potential issues with the KL loss.

Asymmetirc Optimization. As shown in Eqs. (3) and (4), gradient optimization is asymmetric for om
and on. The wMSE and Cross-Entropy losses in Theorem 1 are complementary and collaboratively
work together to make om and on similar. Nevertheless, the asymmetric optimization can cause the
wMSE component to be neglected or overlooked when om is detached from gradient backpropagation,
which is the case for knowledge distillation, potentially leading to performance degradation.

Sample-wise Prediction Bias. As shown in Eq. (5), wm in wMSE component is conditioned on
the prediction score of xm. However, sample-wise predictions can be subject to significant variance.

---Page Break---
Incorrect prediction of hard examples or outliers will mislead the optimization and result in unstable
training. Our study in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 indicates that the choice of wm significantly affects
adversarial robustness.

3.3
Improved Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss

Based on the analysis in Section 3.2, we propose an Improved Kullback-Leibler (IKL) Divergence
loss. Distinguished from DKL in Theorem 1, we make the following improvements: 1) breaking the
asymmetric optimization property; 2) inserting class-wise global information to mitigate sample-wise
bias. The details are presented as follows.

Breaking the Asymmetric Optimization Property. As shown in Eq. (5), the wMSE component
encourages on to resemble om by capturing second-order information, specifically the differences
between logits for each pair of classes. Each addend in wMSE only involves logits of two classes.
We refer to this property as locality. On the other hand, the Cross-Entropy loss ensures that sn and
sm produce similar predicted scores. Each addend in the Cross-Entropy gathers all class logits. We
refer to this property as globality. Two loss terms collaboratively work together to make on and om
similar in locality and globality. Discarding any one of them can lead to performance degradation.

However, because of the asymmetric optimization property of KL/DKL, the unexpected case can
occur when sm is detached from the gradient backpropagation (scenarios like knowledge distillation),
in which the formulation will be:

LDKL−KD(xm, xn) = α

4 ∥
p

S(wm)(S(∆m) −S(∆n))∥2

|
{z
}
weighted MSE (wMSE)

−β · S(s⊤
m) · log sn
|
{z
}
Cross-Entropy

(6)

As indicated by Eq. (6), the wMSE component loss takes no effect on training optimization since all
sub-components of wMSE are detached from gradient propagation, which can potentially hurt the
model performance. Knowledge distillation exactly matches this case because the teacher model is
fixed during knowledge distillation training. Thanks to the decomposition of DKL formulation, we
address this issue by breaking the asymmetric optimization property, i.e., enabling the gradients of
S(∆n) in Eq. (5). Then, the updated formulation of Eq. (6) becomes,

bLDKL−KD(xm, xn) = α

4 ∥
p

S(wm)(S(∆m) −∆n)∥2

|
{z
}
weighted MSE (wMSE)

−β · S(s⊤
m) · log sn
|
{z
}
Cross-Entropy

.
(7)

After enabling the gradients of S(∆n) in Eq. (5), wMSE will produce symmetric gradients on on
and om. Regarding the knowledge distillation, wMSE can output gradient on on and promote the
training optimization demonstrated by Eq. (7).

Inserting Class-wise Global Information. Recall in Theorem 1, wm in Eq. (5) is calculated as:

wj,k
m = sj
m ∗sk
m.
(8)

It indicates that wm depends on the sample-wise prediction scores. Nevertheless, the model cannot
output correct predictions when dealing with outliers or hard examples in training. In this case,
wMSE will attach the most importance on the predicted class ˆy = arg max om rather than the
ground-truth class, which misleads the optimization and makes the training unstable.

We thus insert class-wise global information into wMSE component, replacing wm with ¯wy:

¯wj,k
y
= ¯sj
y ∗¯sk
y,
(9)

where y is ground-truth label of xm, ¯sy =
1
|Xy|
P

xi∈Xy si.

The class-wise global information injected by ¯wy can act as a regularization to enhance intra-class
consistency and mitigate biases that may arise from sample noises. Especially, in the late stage of
training, ¯wy can always provide correct predictions, benefiting the optimization of ¯wMSE component.

A Case Study and Analysis

A Case Study. We empirically examine each component of IKL on CIFAR-100 with the adversarial
training task and on ImageNet with the knowledge distillation task. Ablation experimental results
and their setting descriptions are listed in Table 1. In the implementation, for adversarial training, we
use improved TRADES [71] as our baseline that combines with AWP [66] and uses an increasing
epsilon schedule [1]. For knowledge distillation, we use the official code from DKD. The comparison
between (a) and (b) shows that DKL can achieve comparable performance, confirming the equivalence
to KL. The comparisons among (b), (c), and (d) confirm the effectiveness of the “GI” and “BA".

Analysis on Inserting Class-wise Global Information. As evidenced by Table 1, class-wise global
information plays an important role in adversarial robustness. The mean probability vector ¯sy of
all samples in the class y is more robust than the sample-wise probability vector. During training,
once the model gives incorrect predictions for hard samples or outliers, wm in Eq. (5) will wrongly
guide the optimization. Adoption of ¯wy in Eq. (10) can mitigate the issue and meanwhile enhance
intra-class consistency.

To visualize the effectiveness of inserting class-wise global information, we define the boundary
margin for class y as:
Marginy = ¯sy[y] −max
k̸=y ¯sy[k].
(11)

We plot the margin differences between models trained by IKL-AT and TRADES on CIFAR-100.
As shown in Figure 3c, almost all class margin differences are positive, demonstrating that there
are larger decision boundary margins for the IKL-AT model. Such larger margins lead to stronger
robustness. This phenomenon is coherent with our experimental results in Section 4.1.

We also randomly sample 20 classes in CIFAR-100 for t-SNE visualization. The numbers in the
pictures are class indexes. For each sampled class, we collect the feature representation of natural
images and adversarial examples with the validation set. The visualization by t-SNE is shown in
Figures 3b and 3a. Compared with TRADES that trained with KL loss, features by IKL-AT models
are more compact and separable.

Experiments

To verify the effectiveness of our IKL loss, we conduct experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, and
ImageNet for adversarial training (Section 4.1) and knowledge distillation (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).
More ablation studies are included in Section 4.4.

Adversarial Robustness

Experimental Settings. We use an improved version of TRADES [71] as our baseline, which
incorporates AWP [66] and adopts an increasing epsilon schedule. SGD optimizer with a momentum
of 0.9 is used. We use the cosine learning rate strategy with an initial learning rate of 0.2 and train
models 200 epochs. The batch size is 128, the weight decay is 5e-4 and the perturbation size ϵ is
set to 8/255. Following previous work [71, 14], standard data augmentation including random crops
and random horizontal flip is performed for data preprocessing. Models are trained with 4 Nvidia
GeForce 3090 GPUs.

Under the setting of training with synthesized data by generative models, we strictly follow the
training configurations in DM-AT [64] for fair comparisons. Our implementations are based on their
open-sourced code. We only replace the KL loss with our IKL loss.

Datasets and Evaluation. Following previous work [66, 14], CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are used
for the adversarial training task. we report the clean accuracy on natural images and adversarial
robustness under Auto-Attack [10] with epsilon 8/255.

Comparison Methods. To compare with previous methods, we categorize them into two groups
according to the different types of data preprocessing:

• Methods with basic augmentation, i.e., random crops and random horizontal flip.

• Methods using augmentation with generative models or Auto-Aug [11], CutMix [69].

Comparisons with State-of-the-art on CIFAR-100. On CIFAR-100, with the basic augmentations
setting, we compare with AWP, LBGAT, LAS-AT, and ACAT. The experimental results are summa-
rized in Table 2. Our WRN-34-10 models trained with IKL loss do a better trade-off between natural
accuracy and adversarial robustness. With α

4 = 5 and β = 5, the model achieves 65.76% top-1
accuracy on natural images while 31.91% adversarial robustness under Auto-Attack. An interesting
phenomenon is that IKL-AT is complementary to data augmentation strategies, like AutoAug, without
any specific designs, which is different from the previous observation that the data augmentation
strategy hardly benefits adversarial training [66]. With AutoAug, we obtain 32.53% adversarial
robustness, achieving new state-of-the-art under the setting without extra real or generated data.

We follow DM-AT [64] to take advantage of synthesized images generated by the popular diffusion
models [38]. With 50M generated images, we create new state-of-the-art with WideResNet-28-10,
achieving 73.85% top-1 natural accuracy and 39.18% adversarial robustness under Auto-Attack.

Comparison with State-of-the-art on CIFAR-10. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 are listed in
Table 3. With the basic augmentation setting, our model achieves 84.80% top-1 accuracy on natural
images and 57.09% robustness, outperforming AWP by 0.92% on robustness. With extra generated
data, we improve the state-of-the-art by 0.44%, achieving 67.75% robustness.

4.2
Knowledge Distillation

Datasets and Evaluation. Following previous work [6, 61], we conduct experiments on CIFAR-
100 [40] and ImageNet [54] to show the advantages of IKL on knowledge distillation. For evaluation,
we report top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet validation. The training speed of different
methods is also discussed.

Experimental Settings. We follow the experimental settings in DKD. Our implementation for
knowledge distillation is based on their open-sourced code. Models are trained with 1 and 8 Nvidia
GeForce 3090 GPUs on CIFAR and ImageNet separately.

Specifically, on CIFAR-100, we train all models for 240 epochs with a learning rate that decayed by
0.1 at the 150th, 180th, and 210th epoch. We initialize the learning rate to 0.01 for MobileNet and
ShuffleNet, and 0.05 for other models. The batch size is 64 for all models. We train all models three
times and report the mean accuracy. On ImageNet, we use the standard training that trains the model
for 100 epochs and decays the learning rate for every 30 epochs. We initialize the learning rate to 0.2
and set the batch size to 512.

For both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, we consider the distillation among the architectures having
the same unit structures, like ResNet56 and ResNet20, VGGNet13 and VGGNet8. On the other

hand, we also explore the distillation among architectures made up of different unit structures, like
WideResNet and ShuffleNet, VggNet and MobileNet-V2.

Comparison Methods. According to the information extracted from the teacher model in distillation
training, knowledge distillation methods can be divided into two categories:

• Features-based methods [53, 61, 6, 30]. This kind of method makes use of features from
different layers of the teacher model, which can need extra parameters and high training
computational costs.
• Logits-based methods [33, 73]. This kind of method only makes use of the logits output of
the teacher model, which does not require knowing the architectures of the teacher model
and thus is more general in practice.

Comparison with State-of-the-art on CIFAR-100. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 are summa-
rized in Table 13 and Table 14 (in Appendix). Table 13 lists the comparisons with previous methods
under the setting that the architectures of the teacher and student have the same unit structures.
Models trained by IKL-KD can achieve comparable or better performance in all considered settings.
Specifically, we achieve the best performance in 4 out of 6 training settings. Table 14 shows the
comparisons with previous methods under the setting that the architectures of the teacher and student
have different unit structures. We achieve the best performance in 3 out of 5 training configurations.

Comparison with State-of-the-art on ImageNet. We empirically show the comparisons with
other methods on ImageNet in Table 4. With a ResNet34 teacher, our ResNet18 achieves 71.91%
top-1 accuracy. With a ResNet50 teacher, our MobileNet achieves 72.84% top-1 accuracy. Models
trained by IKL-KD surpass all previous methods while saving 38% and 52% computation costs
for ResNet34–ResNet18 and ResNet50–MobileNet distillation training respectively when compared
with ReviewKD [6].

Knowledge Distillation on Imbalanced Data

Data often follows a long-tailed distribution. Tackling the long-tailed recognition problem is essential
for real-world applications. Lots of research has contributed to algorithms and theories [3, 19, 37, 47,
17, 16, 18, 77, 75] on the problem. In this work, we examine how the knowledge distillation with our
IKL loss affects model performance on imbalanced data, i.e., ImageNet-LT [45]. We train ResNets
models 90 epochs with Random-Resized-Crop and horizontal flip as image pre-processing. Following
previous work [13], we report the top-1 accuracy on Many-shot, Meidum-shot, Few-shot, and All
classes. As shown in Table 5, IKL-KD consistently outperforms KL-KD on imbalanced data.

4.4
Ablation Studies

Ablation on α and β for Adversarial Robustness. Thanks to the decomposition of the DKL
loss formulation, the two components (wMSE and Cross-Entropy) of IKL can be manipulated
independently. We empirically study the effects of hyper-parameters of α and β on CIFAR-100 for
adversarial robustness. Clean accuracy on natural data and robustness under AA [10] are reported in
Table 7 and Table 8. Reasonable α and β should be chosen for the best trade-off between natural
accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Ablation on Temperature (τ) for Global Information. As discussed in Section 3.3, the incorporated
class-wise global information is proposed to promote intra-class consistency and mitigate the biases

from sample noises. When calculating the ¯wy and ¯sy, a temperature τ could be applied before getting
sample probability vectors. We summarize the experimental results in Table 9 for ablation of τ.
Interestingly, we observe that models usually exhibit higher performance on clean images with a
higher τ. There are even 5.75% improvements of clear accuracy while keeping comparable robustness
when changing τ = 1 to τ = 4, which implies the vast importance of weights in wMSE component
of DKL/KL for adversarial robustness. To achieve the strongest robustness, we finally choose τ = 4
as illustrated by empirical study.

Ablation on Various Perturbation Size ϵ. We evaluate model robustness with unknown perturbation
size ϵ in training under Auto-Attack. The experimental results are summarized in Table 10. As shown
in Table 10, model robustness decreases significantly as the ϵ increases for both the TRADES model
and our model. Nevertheless, our model achieves stronger robustness than the TRADES model
under all of ϵ, outperforming TRADES by 1.34% on average robustness. The experimental results
demonstrate the super advantages of models adversarially trained with our IKL loss.

Robustness under Other Attacks. Auto-Attack is currently one of the strongest attack methods. It
ensembles several adversarial attack methods including APGD-CE, APGD-DLR, FAB, and Square
Attack. To show the effectiveness of our IKL loss, we also evaluate our models under PGD and CW
attacks with 10 and 20 iterations. The perturbation size and step size are set to 8/255 and 2/255
respectively. As shown in Table 11, with increasing iterations from 10 to 20, our models show similar
robustness, demonstrating that our models don’t suffer from obfuscated gradients problem.

Conclusion and Limitation

In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss in terms
of gradient optimization. Based on our analysis, we decouple the KL loss into a weighted Mean
Square Error (wMSE) loss and a Cross-Entropy loss with soft labels. The new formulation is named
Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss. To address the spotted issues of KL/DKL, we
make two improvements that break the asymmetric optimization property and incorporate class-wise
global information, deriving the Improved Kullback-Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet show that we create new state-of-the-art adversarial robust-
ness and competitive performance on knowledge distillation. This underscores the efficacy of our
Innovative KL (IKL) loss technique. The KL loss exhibits a wide range of applications. As part of
our future work, we aim to explore and highlight the versatility of IKL in various other scenarios,
like robustness on out-of-distribution data, and incremental learning.

To demonstrate that DKL in Eq. (5) is equivalent to KL in Eq. (2) for training optimization, we prove
that DKL and KL produce the same gradients when given the same inputs.

For KL loss, we have the following derivatives according to the chain rule:

Comparing Eq. (12) and Eq. (15), Eq. (13) and Eq. (16), we conclude that DKL loss and KL loss
have the same derivatives given the same inputs. Thus, DKL loss is equivalent to KL loss in terms of
gradient optimization.

New state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-100/10

Robustbench is the most popular benchmark for adversarial robust models in the community. It
evaluates the performance of models by the Auto-Attack. Auto-Attack [10] is an ensemble of different
kinds of attack methods and is considered the most effective method to test the robustness of models.

We achieve new state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under both settings w/
and w/o generated data. As shown in Table 12, on CIFAR-100 without extra generated data, we
achieve 32.53% robustness, outperforming the previous best result by 0.68% while saving 33.3%
computational cost. With generated data, our model boosts performance to 73.85% natural accuracy,
surpassing the previous best result by 1.27% while maintaining the strongest robustness. More
detailed comparisons can be accessed on the public leaderboard https://robustbench.github.

Comparisons on CIFAR-100 for Knowledge Distillation

We experiment on CIFAR-100 with the following cases: 1) the teacher and student models have
the same unit network architectures; 2) the teacher and student models have different unit network
architectures. The results are listed in Table 13 and Table 14. We have achieved the best results in 4
out of 6 and 3 out of 5 experimental settings respectively.

Moreover, we follow the concurrent work [24] and conduct experiments with BEiT-Large as the
teacher and ResNet-50 as the student under a strong training scheme, the experimental results are
summarized in Table 15. The model trained by IKL-KD shows slightly better results.

Other Applications with IKL

Semisupervised learning.
We use the open-sourced code from https://github.com/
microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning and conduct semi-supervised experiments on CIFAR-
100 with FixMatch and Mean-Teacher methods. Specifically, each class has 2 labeled images and
500 unlabeled images. All default training hyper-parameters are used for fair comparisons. We
only replace the consistency loss with our IKL loss. As shown in Table 16, with our IKL loss, the
Mean-Teacher method even surpasses the FixMatch.

Semantic segmentation distillation. We conduct ablation on the semantic segmentation distillation
task. We use the APD [62] as our baseline for their open-sourced code. All default hyper-parameters
are adopted. We only replace the original KL loss with our IKL loss. As shown in Table 17, we
achieve better performance with the IKL loss function, demonstrating that the IKL loss can be
complementary to other techniques in semantic segmentation distillation.

Complexity of IKL

Compared with the KL divergence loss, IKL loss is required to update the global class-wise prediction
scores W ∈RC×C where C is the number of classes during training. This extra computational
cost can be nearly ignored when compared with the model forward and backward. Algorithm 1

---Page Break---
shows the implementation of our IKL loss in Pytorch style. On dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation, ∆a and ∆b can require large GPU Memory. Here, we also provide the memory-efficient
implementations for wMSE loss component, which is listed in Algorithm 2.

Algorithm 1 Pseudo code for DKL/IKL loss in Pytorch style.

Input: logitsa, logitsb ∈RB×C, one-hot label Y , W ∈RC×C, α, β.
class_scores = one-hot @ W;
Sample_weights = class_scores.view(-1, C, 1) @ class_scores.view(-1, 1, C);
∆a = logitsa.view(-1, C, 1) - logitsa.view(-1, 1, C);
∆b = logitsb.view(-1, C, 1) - logitsb.view(-1, 1, C);
wMSE_loss = (torch.pow(∆n - ∆a, 2) * Sample_weights).sum(dim=(1,2)).mean() * 1

4;
score_a = F.softmax(logitsa, dim=1).detach();
log_score_b = F.log_softmax(logitsb, dim=-1);
CE_loss = -(score_a * log_score_b).sum(1).mean();
return β * CE_loss + α * wMSE_loss.

logitsa).sum(dim=1), 2) * 2;
loss_b = (class_scores * logitsb * logitsb).sum(dim=1) * 2 - torch.pow((class_scores *

(20)

Compared with IKL loss, the problem for JSD divergence in knowledge distillation is that: The soft
labels from the teacher models often embed dark knowledge and facilitate the optimization of the
student models. However, there are no effects of the cross-entropy loss with the soft labels from the
teacher model, which can be the underlying reason that JSD is worse than KD and IKL-KD.

As shown in Table 18, we also empirically demonstrate that IKL loss performs better than JSD
divergence on the knowledge distillation task.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We theoretically prove that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss is
equivalent to a Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) loss regarding gradient optimization.
Based on this analysis, we improve KL/DKL loss on adversarial training and knowledge
distillation tasks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The conclusion and limitation section is included.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our proof to Theorem 1 is in Appendix A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed experimental settings in Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

21


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide a link for our code and models in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed experimental settings in Section 4 and ablations for
hyper-parameters in the Appendix 4.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Error bars are included in Table 14 of the Appendix. Due to the heavy
computation, other tables don’t provide error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

22


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: On adversarial training, Each run with basic augmentations takes around 2
days using 4GPUs while 5 days using 8 GPUs for adversarial training with generated data.
On knowledge distillation, 8 Nvidia GeForce 3090 GPUs are used on ImageNet. Each run
takes about 1 day for our method.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research conforms NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper is fundamental research in adversarial robustness and knowledge
distillation and there is no obvious societal impact.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

23


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our models don’t suffer from a high risk for misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Proper citations are added to the paper. Licenses for used data is included in
Appendix A.7.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our research does not involve crowdsourcing or human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our research does not involve crowdsourcing or human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
