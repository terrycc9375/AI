Abstract

This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim
to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular
depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1 [89], this version produces
much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1)
replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity
of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale
pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models [31] built on Stable
Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10× faster) and
more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B
params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization
capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth
models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent
noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise
annotations and diverse scenes to facilitate future research.

Introduction

Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is gaining increasing attention, due to its fundamental role in
widespread downstream tasks. Precise depth information is not only favorable in classical applications,
such as 3D reconstruction [47, 32, 93], navigation [82], and autonomous driving [80], but is also
preferable in modern scenarios, e.g., AI-generated content, including images [101], videos [39], and
3D scenes [87, 64, 68]. Therefore, there have been numerous MDE models [56, 7, 6, 95, 26, 38, 31,
89, 88, 25, 20, 52, 28] emerging recently, which are all capable of addressing open-world images.

From the aspect of model architecture, these works can be divided into two groups. One group [7, 6,
89, 28] is based on discriminative models, e.g., BEiT [4] and DINOv2 [50], while the other [31, 20, 25]
is based on generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion (SD) [59]. In Figure 2, we compare two
representative works from the two categories respectively: Depth Anything [89] as a discriminative
model and Marigold [31] as a generative model. It can be easily observed that Marigold is superior in
modeling the details, while Depth Anything produces more robust predictions for complex scenes.
Moreover, as summarized in Table 1, Depth Anything is more efficient and lightweight than Marigold,
with different scales to choose from. Meantime, however, Depth Anything is vulnerable to transparent
objects and reflections, which are the strengths of Marigold.

In this work, taking all these factors into account, we aim to build a more capable foundation model
for monocular depth estimation that can achieve all the strengths listed in Table 1:

• produce robust predictions for complex scenes, including but not limited to complex layouts,
transparent objects (e.g., glass), reflective surfaces (e.g., mirrors, screens) [15], etc.
• contain fine details (comparable to the details of Marigold) in the predicted depth maps,
including but not limited to thin objects (e.g., chair legs) [42], small holes, etc.
• provide varied model scales and inference efficiency to support extensive applications [82].
• be generalizable enough to be transferred (i.e., fine-tuned) to downstream tasks, e.g., Depth
Anything V1 serves as the pre-trained model for all the leading teams in the 3rd MDEC1 [72].

Since the nature of MDE is a discriminative task, we start from Depth Anything V1 [89], aiming to
maintain its strengths and rectify its weaknesses. Intriguingly, we will demonstrate that, to achieve

such a challenging goal, no fancy or sophisticated techniques need to be developed. The most critical
part is still data. It is indeed the same as the data-driven motivation of V1, which harnesses large-scale
unlabeled data to speed up data scaling-up and increase the data coverage. In this work, we instead
will first revisit its labeled data design, and then highlight the key role of unlabeled data.

We first present three key findings below. We will clarify them in detail in the following three sections.

Q1 [Section 2]: Whether the coarse depth of MiDaS or Depth Anything come from the discriminative
modeling itself? Is it a must to adopt the heavy diffusion-based modeling manner for fine details?
A1: No, efficient discriminative models can also produce extremely fine details. The most critical
modification is replacing all labeled real images with precise synthetic images.

Q2 [Section 3]: Why do most prior works still stick to real images, if as A1 mentioned, synthetic
images are already clearly superior to real images?
A2: Synthetic images have their drawbacks, which are not trivial to address in previous paradigms.

Q3 [Section 4]: How to avoid the drawbacks of synthetic images and also amplify its advantages?
A3: Scale up the teacher model that is solely trained on synthetic images, and then teach (smaller)
student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images.

After the explorations, we successfully build a more capable MDE foundation model. However, we
find current test sets [70] are too noisy to reflect the true strengths of MDE models. Thus, we further
construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with precise annotations and diverse scenes (Section 6).

Revisiting the Labeled Data Design of Depth Anything V1

Building on the pioneering work of MiDaS [56, 7] in zero-shot MDE, recent studies tend to construct
larger-scale training datasets in an effort to enhance estimation performance. Notably, Depth Anything
V1 [89], Metric3D V1 [95] and V2 [28], as well as ZeroDepth [26], have amassed 1.5M, 8M, 16M,
and 15M labeled images from various sources for training, respectively. However, few studies have
critically examined this trend: is such a huge amount of labeled images truly advantageous?

Before answering it, let us first dig into the potentially overlooked drawbacks of real labeled images.

Two disadvantages of real labeled data. 1) Label noise, i.e., inaccurate labels in depth maps.
Stemming from the limitations inherent in various collection procedures, real labeled data inevitably
contain inaccurate estimations. Such inaccuracies can arise from various factors, such as the inability
of depth sensors to accurately capture the depth of transparent objects (Figure 3a), the vulnerability
of stereo matching algorithms to textureless or repetitive patterns (Figure 3b), and the susceptible
nature of SfM methods in handling dynamic objects or outliers (Figure 3c). 2) Ignored details. These
real datasets often overlook certain details in their depth maps. As depicted in Figure 4a, the depth

representation of the tree and chair is notably coarse. These datasets struggle to provide detailed
supervision at object boundaries or within thin holes, resulting in over-smoothed depth predictions,
as seen in the middle of Figure 4c. Hence, these noisy labels are so unreliable that the learned models
make similar mistakes (Figure 3d). For example, MiDaS and Depth Anything V1 obtain poor scores
of 25.9% and 53.5% respectively in the Transparent Surface Challenge [54] (more details in Table 12:
our V2 achieves a competitive score of 83.6% in a zero-shot manner).

To overcome the above problems, we decide to change our training data and seek images with sub-
stantially better annotation. Inspired by several recent SD-based studies [31, 20, 25], that exclusively
utilize synthetic images with complete depth information for training, we extensively check the label
quality of synthetic images and note their potential to mitigate the drawbacks discussed above.

Advantages of synthetic images. Their depth labels are highly precise in two folds. 1) All fine
details (e.g., boundaries, thin holes, small objects, etc.) are correctly labeled. As demonstrated in
Figure 4b, even all thin mesh structures and leaves are annotated with true depth. 2) We can obtain
the actual depth of challenging transparent objects and reflective surfaces, e.g., the vase on the table
in Figure 4b. In a word, the depth of synthetic images is truly “GT”. In the right side of Figure 4c, we
show the fine-grained prediction of a MDE model trained on synthetic images. Moreover, we can
quickly enlarge synthetic training images by collecting from graphics engines [58, 63, 53], which
would not cause any privacy or ethical concerns, as compared to real images.

3
Challenges in Using Synthetic Data

If synthetic data are so advantageous, why are real data still dominating MDE? In this section, we
identify two limitations of synthetic images that hinder them from being easily used in reality.

Limitation 1. There exists distribution shift between synthetic and real images. Although current
graphics engines strive for photorealistic effects, their style and color distributions still evidently
differ from real images. Synthetic images are too “clean” in color and “ordered” in layout, while real
images contain more randomness. For instance, when comparing the images in Figure 4a and 4b,
we can immediately distinguish the synthetic ones. Such distribution shift makes models struggle to
transfer from synthetic to real images, even if the two data sources share similar layouts [57, 9].

Limitation 2. Synthetic images have restricted scene coverage. They are iteratively sampled
from graphics engines with pre-defined fixed scene types, e.g., “living room” and “street scene”.
Consequently, despite the astonishing precision of Hypersim [58] or Virtual KITTI [9] (Figure 4b),
we cannot expect models trained on them to generalize well in real-world scenes like “crowded
people”. In contrast, some real datasets constructed from web stereo images (e.g., HRWSI [83]) or
monocular videos (e.g., MegaDepth [37]), can cover extensive real-world scenes.

Figure 6: Failure cases of the most capable DINOv2-G model when purely trained on synthetic
images. Left: the sky should be ultra far. Right: the depth of the head is not consistent with the body.

Therefore, synthetic-to-real transfer is non-trivial in MDE. To validate this claim, we conduct a
pilot study to learning MDE models solely on synthetic images with four popular pre-trained encoders,
including BEiT [4], SAM [33], SynCLR [75], and DINOv2 [50]. As illustrated in Figure 5, only
DINOv2-G achieves satisfying results. All other model serials, as well as smaller DINOv2 models,
suffer from severe generalization issues. This pilot study seems to give a straightforward solution to
employing synthetic data in MDE, i.e., building on the largest DINOv2 encoder, and relying on its
inherent generalization ability. However, this naive solution faces two problems. First, DINOv2-G
frequently encounters failure cases when the patterns of real test images are rarely presented in
synthetic training images. In Figure 6, we can clearly observe incorrect depth predictions for the
sky (cloud) and the human head. Such failures can be expected as our synthetic training sets do
not include diverse sky patterns or humans. Moreover, most applications cannot accommodate the
resource-intensive DINOv2-G model (1.3B) in terms of storage and inference efficiency. Actually,
the smallest model in Depth Anything V1 is used most widely due to its real-time speed.

To alleviate the generalization issue, some works [7, 89, 28] use a combined training set of real and
synthetic images. Unfortunately, as shown in Section B.9, the coarse depth map of real images is
destructive to fine-grained prediction. Another potential solution is to collect more synthetic images,
which is unsustainable as creating graphic engines mimicking every real-world scenario is intractable.
Therefore, a reliable solution is demanding in building MDE models with synthetic data. In this paper,
we will close this gap and present a roadmap that solves the preciseness and robustness dilemma
without any trade-offs, and applicable to any model scale.

4
Key Role of Large-Scale Unlabeled Real Images

Our solution is straightforward: incorporating unlabeled real images. Our most capable MDE model,
based on DINOv2-G, is initially trained purely on high-quality synthetic images. Then it assigns
pseudo depth labels on unlabeled real images. Lastly, our new models are solely trained with large-
scale and precisely pseudo-labeled images. Depth Anything V1 [89] has highlighted the importance
of large-scale unlabeled real data. Here, in our special context of synthetic labeled images, we will
demonstrate its indispensable role in more details from three perspectives.

Bridge the domain gap. As aforementioned, due to the distribution shift, directly transferring
from synthetic training images to real test images is challenging. But if we can leverage extra
real images as an intermediate learning target, the process will be more reliable. Intuitively, after
explicitly training on pseudo-labeled real images, models can be more familiar with real-world data
distribution. Compared with manually annotated images, our auto-generated pseudo labels are much
more fine-grained and complete, as visualized in Figure 17.

Figure 7: Depth Anything V2. We first train the most capable teacher on precise synthetic images.
Then, to mitigate the distribution shift and limited diversity of synthetic data, we annotate unlabeled
real images with the teacher. Finally, we train student models on high-quality pseudo-labeled images.

Enhance the scene coverage. The diversity of synthetic images is limited, without including enough
real-world scenes. Nevertheless, we can easily cover numerous distinct scenes by incorporating
large-scale unlabeled images from public datasets. Moreover, synthetic images are indeed very
redundant due to being repetitively sampled from pre-defined videos. In comparison, unlabeled real
images are clearly distinguished and very informative. By training on sufficient images and scenes,
models not only demonstrate stronger zero-shot MDE capability (as shown in Figure 6 “+ unlabeled
real images”), but they can also serve as better pre-trained sources for downstream related tasks [72].

Transfer knowledge from the most capable model to smaller ones. We have shown in Figure 5,
that smaller models cannot directly benefit from synthetic-to-real transfer by themselves. However,
armed with large-scale unlabeled real images, they can learn to mimic the high-quality predictions
of the most capable model, similar to knowledge distillation [27]. But differently, our distillation is
enforced at the label level via extra unlabeled real data, instead of at the feature or logit level with
original labeled data. This practice is safer because there is evidence showing feature-level distillation
is not always beneficial, especially when the teacher-student scale gap is huge [48]. Finally, as
supported in Figure 16, unlabeled images boost the robustness of our smaller models tremendously.

Depth Anything V2

5.1
Overall Framework

According to all the above analysis, our final pipeline to train Depth Anything V2 is clear (Figure 7).
It consists of three steps:

• train a reliable teacher model based on DINOv2-G purely on high-quality synthetic images.
• produce precise pseudo depth on large-scale unlabeled real images.
• train final student models on pseudo-labeled real images for robust generalization (we will
show the synthetic images are not necessary in this step).

We will release four student models, based on DINOv2 small, base, large, and giant, respectively.

5.2
Details

As shown in Table 7, we use five precise synthetic datasets (595K images) and eight large-scale
pseudo-labeled real datasets (62M images) for training. Same as V1 [89], for each pseudo-labeled
sample, we ignore its top-n-largest-loss regions during training, where n is set as 10%. We consider
them as potentially noisy pseudo labels. Similarly, our models produce affine-invariant inverse depth2.
We use two loss terms for optimization on labeled images: a scale- and shift-invariant loss Lssi and
a gradient matching loss Lgm. These two objective functions are not new, as they are proposed by
MiDaS [56]. But differently, we find Lgm is super beneficial to the depth sharpness when using
synthetic images (Section B.7). On pseudo-labeled images, we follow V1 to add an additional feature
alignment loss to preserve informative semantics from pre-trained DINOv2 encoders.

2To offer capable metric depth models, we further fine-tune our basic models with metric depth (Section 7.3).

A New Evaluation Benchmark: DA-2K

6.1
Limitations in Existing Benchmarks

In Section 2, we demonstrated that commonly used real training sets have noisy depth labels. Here,
we further argue that widely adopted test benchmarks are also noisy. Figure 8 illustrates incorrect
annotations for mirrors and thin structures on NYU-D [70] despite using specialized depth sensors.
Such frequent label noise makes the reported metrics of powerful MDE models not reliable anymore.

Apart from label noise, another drawback of these benchmarks is limited diversity. Most of them were
originally proposed for a single scene. For example, NYU-D [70] focuses on a few indoor rooms,
while KITTI [24] only contains several street scenes. Performance on these benchmarks may not
reflect real-world reliability. Ideally, we expect MDE models can handle any unseen scenes robustly.

The last problem in these existing benchmarks is low resolution. They mostly provide images with a
resolution of around 500×500. But with modern cameras, we usually require precise depth estimation
for higher-resolution images, e.g., 1000×2000. It remains unclear whether the conclusions drawn
from these low-resolution benchmarks can be safely transferred to high-resolution benchmarks.

6.2
DA-2K

Considering the above three limitations, we aim to construct a versatile evaluation benchmark for
relative monocular depth estimation, that can 1) provide precise depth relationship, 2) cover extensive
scenes, and 3) contain mostly high-resolution images for modern usage. Indeed, it is impractical
for humans to annotate the depth of each pixel, especially for in-the-wild images. Thus, following
DIW [11], we annotate sparse depth pairs for each image. Generally, given an image, we can select
two pixels on it, and decide their relative depth between them (i.e., which pixel is closer).

Concretely, we employ two distinct pipelines to select pixel pairs. In the first pipeline, as shown in
Figure 9a, we use SAM [33] to automatically predict object masks. Instead of using the masks, we
leverage key points (pixels) that prompt out them. We randomly sample two key pixels and query
four expert models ([89, 31, 20] and ours) to vote on their relative depth. If there is disagreement, the
pair will be sent to human annotators to decide the true relative depth. Due to potential ambiguity,
annotators can skip any pair. However, there may be cases where all models incorrectly predict
challenging pairs, and they are not flagged. To address this, we introduce a second pipeline, where
we carefully analyze images and manually identify challenging pairs.

To ensure preciseness, all annotations are triple-checked by the other two annotators. To ensure
diversity, we first summarize eight important application scenarios of MDE (Figure 9b), and ask GPT-
4 to produce diverse keywords related to each scenario. We then use these keywords to download
corresponding images from Flickr. Finally, we annotate 1K images with 2K pixel pairs in total.
Limited by space, please refer to Section C for details and comparisons with DIW [11].

Position of DA-2K. Despite the advantages, we do not expect DA-2K to replace current benchmarks.
Accurate sparse depth is still far from the precise dense depth required for scene reconstruction.
However, DA-2K can be considered a prerequisite for accurate dense depth. As such, we believe
DA-2K can serve as a valuable supplement to existing benchmarks due to its extensive scene coverage
and precision. It can also serve as a quick prior validation for users selecting community models
for specific scenarios covered in DA-2K. Lastly, we believe it is also a potential testbed for the 3D
awareness of future multimodal LLMs [41, 21, 3].

Experiment

7.1
Implementation details

Follow Depth Anything V1 [89], we use DPT [55] as our depth decoder, built on DINOv2 encoders.
All images are trained at the resolution of 518×518 by resizing the shorter size to 518 followed by a
random crop. When training the teacher model on synthetic images, we use a batch size of 64 for
160K iterations. In the third stage of training on pseudo-labeled real images, the model is trained
with a batch size of 192 for 480K iterations. We use the Adam optimizer and set the learning rate of
the encoder and the decoder as 5e-6 and 5e-5, respectively. In both training stages, we do not balance
the training datasets, but simply concatenate them. The weight ratio of Lssi and Lgm is set as 1:2.

7.2
Zero-Shot Relative Depth Estimation

Performance on conventional benchmarks. Since our model predicts affine-invariant inverse depth,
for fairness, we compare with Depth Anything V1 [89] and MiDaS V3.1 [7] on five unseen test
datasets. As shown in Table 2, our results are superior to MiDaS and comparable to V1 [89]. We
are slightly inferior to V1 in metrics on two of the datasets. However, the plain metrics on these
datasets are not the focus of this paper. This version aims to produce fine-grained predictions for thin
structures and robust predictions for complex scenes, transparent objects, etc.. Improvement in these
dimensions cannot be correctly reflected in current benchmarks.

Performance on our proposed benchmark DA-2K. As shown in Table 3, on our proposed bench-
mark with diverse scenes, even our smallest model is significantly better than other heavy SD-based

models, e.g., Marigold [31] and Geowizard [20]. Our most capable model achieves 10.6% higher
accuracy than Margold in terms of relative depth discrimination. Please refer to Table 14 for the
comprehensive per-scenario performance of our models.

7.3
Fine-tuned to Metric Depth Estimation

To validate the generalization ability of our model, we transfer its encoder to the downstream metric
depth estimation task. First, same as V1 [89], we follow the ZoeDepth [6] pipeline, but replace
its MiDaS [7] encoder with our pre-trained encoder. As shown in Table 4, we achieve significant
improvements over previous methods on both NYU-D and KITTI datasets. Notably, even our most
lightweight model which is based on ViT-S, is superior to other models built on ViT-L [6].

Although the reported metrics look impressive, models trained on NYUv2 or KITTI fail to produce
fine-grained depth prediction and are not robust to transparent objects, due to the inherent noise in
training sets. Therefore, to satisfy real-world applications such as multi-view synthesis, we fine-tune
our powerful encoder on Hypersim [58] and Virtual KITTI [9] synthetic datasets, for indoor and
outdoor metric depth estimation, respectively. We will release these two metric depth models. Please
refer to Figure 15 for qualitative comparisons with the previous ZoeDepth method.

7.4
Ablation Study

Limited by space, we defer most of our ablations to the appendix except for two on pseudo labels.

Importance of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. As shown in Table 5, compared with solely
trained on synthetic images, our models are greatly enhanced by incorporating pseudo-labeled real
images. Different from Depth Anything V1 [89], we further attempt to remove the synthetic images
during training student models. We find this can even lead to slightly better results for smaller models
(e.g., ViT-S and ViT-B). So we finally choose to train student models purely on pseudo-labeled
images. This observation is indeed similar to SAM [33] that only releases its pseudo-labeled masks.

Table 6: Comparison between originally manual label and our produced pseudo label on the DIML dataset [14].
Our produced pseudo labels are of much higher quality than the manual labels provided by DIML.

Pseudo label vs. manual label on real labeled images. We have demonstrated before in Figure 4a
that existing labeled real datasets are very noisy. Here we conduct a quantitative comparison. We use
real images from the DIML [14] dataset, and compare the transferring performance under its original
manual label and our produced pseudo label respectively. We can observe in Table 6 that the model
trained with pseudo labels is significantly better than the manual-label counterpart. The huge gap
indicates the high quality of our pseudo labels and the rich noise in current labeled real datasets.

Related Work

Monocular depth estimation. Early works [18, 19, 5] focus on the in-domain metric depth estima-
tion, where training and test images must share the same domain [70, 24]. Due to their restricted
application scenarios, recently there has been increasing attention on zero-shot relative monocular
depth estimation. Among them, some works address this task through better modeling manners,
e.g., using Stable Diffusion [59] as a depth denoiser [31, 25, 20]. Other works [94, 96, 89] focus
on the data-driven perspective. For example, MiDaS [56, 55, 7] and Metric3D [95] collect 2M
and 8M labeled images respectively. Aware of the difficulty of scaling up labeled images, Depth
Anything V1 [89] leverages 62M unlabeled images to enhance the model’s robustness. In this work,
differently, we point out multiple limitations in widely used labeled real images. We thus especially
highlight the necessity of resorting to synthetic images to ensure depth preciseness. Meantime, to
tackle the generalization issue caused by synthetic images, we adopt both data-driven (large-scale
pseudo-labeled real images) and model-driven (scaling up the teacher model) strategies.

Learning from unlabeled real images. How to learn informative representations from unlabeled
images is widely studied in the field of semi-supervised learning [36, 86, 71, 90]. However, they
focus on academic benchmarks [34] which only allow usage of small-scale labeled and unlabeled
images. In comparison, we study a real-world application scenario, i.e., how to further boost the
baseline of 0.6M labeled images with 62M unlabeled images. Moreover, distinguished from Depth
Anything V1 [89], we exhibit the indispensable role of unlabeled real images especially when we
replace all labeled real images with synthetic images [22, 23, 61]. We demonstrate “precise synthetic
data + pseudo-labeled real data” is a more promising roadmap than labeled real data.

Knowledge distillation. We distill transferable knowledge from our most capable teacher model to
smaller models. This is similar to the core spirit of knowledge distillation (KD) [27]. But we are also
fundamentally different in that we perform distillation at the prediction level through extra unlabeled
real images, while KD [2, 73, 100] typically studies better distillation strategies at the feature or logit
level through labeled images. We aim to reveal the importance of large-scale unlabeled data and
larger teacher model, rather than delicate loss designs [43, 69] or distillation pipelines [10]. Moreover,
it is indeed non-trivial and risky to directly distill feature representations between two models with a
tremendous scale gap [48]. In comparison, our pseudo-label distillation is easier and safer.

Conclusion

In this work, we present Depth Anything V2, a more powerful foundation model for monocular depth
estimation. It is capable of 1) providing robust and fine-grained depth prediction, 2) supporting
extensive applications with varied model sizes (from 25M to 1.3B parameters), and 3) being easily
fine-tuned to downstream tasks as a promising model initialization. We reveal crucial findings to pave
the way towards building a strong MDE model. Furthermore, realizing the poor diversity and rich
noise in existing test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark DA-2K, covering diverse
high-resolution images with precise and challenging sparse depth labels.

A
Sources of Training Data

As listed in Table 7, we replace all labeled real datasets in Depth Anything V1 [89] with five synthetic
datasets for label preciseness. Then, to mitigate the issues of distribution shift and limited diversity
caused by synthetic images, we further leverage eight large-scale public datasets, comprising 62M
real images with great diversity. We only use their raw images, and assign depth to them with our
most capable teacher model. Student models are trained purely on these pseudo-labeled real images.

B
Experiments

B.1
Fine-tuned to semantic segmentation

Similar to the practice in metric MDE, we further fine-tune our pre-trained encoder to downstream
semantic segmentation task to especially examine its semantic awareness. As demonstrated in Table 8,

our models of various scales consistently achieve the best performance, outperforming other methods
remarkably. These promising results indicate the potential of our model to serve as the initialization
for diverse downstream semantic-related tasks.

B.2
Transferring performance of each labeled dataset

We totally use five synthetic datasets to train our teacher model for pseudo labeling. Here we
examine their individual effect on the model generalization capability. As demonstrated in Table 9,
among them, the two purely indoor datasets Hypersim [58] and IRS [77] surprisingly fuel the most
generalization ability. Although VKITTI 2 [9] has poor metric results, we find it is highly beneficial to
the prediction sharpness, due to the large number of fine-grained structures (e.g., leaves) in its training
samples. Moreover, BlendedMVS [92] is critical to the capability of dealing with the bird’s-eye view.
Overall, each dataset has its own good properties to benefit the combined performance.

Transferring performance of each unlabeled dataset

We further analyze the benefit of each unlabeled source in Table 10. Accordingly, we present three
observations. 1) Except the Sintel [8] synthetic game test set, unlabeled real images benefit all test
sets tremendously. 2) When unlabeled images and test images share the same domain, the test results
are improved most, e.g., LSUN (indoor) improves the δ1 metric on NYU-D (indoor) from 0.928
→0.970. 3) Even if unlabeled images and test images belong to contradictory domains, unlabeled
images are still beneficial, e.g., LSUN improves the δ1 on KITTI (street scene) from 0.889 →0.913.

B.4
Are such large-scale unlabeled images really necessary?

We have proved that our used 62M unlabeled images are critical to model performance. However, we
question that, is such a huge scale really necessary? What if we only use part of unlabeled sets and
iterate the model for more epochs on it? To validate this, we solely use the SA-1B [33] dataset as our
unlabeled source and train a model on it for the same iterations we use for 62M unlabeled images.
As shown in Table 11, data diversity (i.e., more datasets) is still highly important, which cannot be
bridged by simply iterating a single dataset for more cycles. So we believe our large-scale unlabeled
real images are necessary to ensure open-world generalization.

B.5
Performance on transparent or reflective surfaces

As aforementioned, one advantage of synthetic samples is the precise depth of the challenging
transparent and reflective surfaces, which is important in navigation applications [82]. To validate the
performance of our V2 in this specific domain, we compare different model predictions in the latest
NTIRE 2024 Transparent Surface Challenge3 [54]. Validation results are summarized in Table 12.
Our V2 model achieves a remarkable boost over MiDaS [56] and Depth Anything V1 [89] in a
zero-shot manner. Further, by simply fine-tuning our model with the challenge training data, we can
nearly achieve the first-place score (0.912 vs. 0.917). Compared with the DINOv2 [50] encoder, our
pre-trained model acts as a much stronger initialization (0.758 vs. 0.912).

B.6
Comparison among various pre-trained encoders

We compare several currently most powerful pre-trained encoders in our MDE task, including
BEiT [4], SAM [33], SynCLR [75], DINOv2 [50], and DINOv2 with registers [16]. As shown in
Table 13, at the ViT-large scale, we find DINOv2 serial [50, 16] is remarkably superior to all other
encoders. The success of DINOv2 further reflects the promising future of the data-driven roadmap,
since it carefully collects 142M pre-training data without designing fancy algorithms or architectures.

When scaling up the ViT-large encoder to ViT-giant, we surprisingly observe DINOv2-G Reg [16] is
much inferior to the non-register initial version [50]. This is the same as the findings in Probe3D [3].
Thus, we choose to build our teacher and student models on the original DINOv2 encoders.

B.7
Benefit of gradient matching loss to fine-grained predictions

MiDaS [56] proposes a gradient matching loss Lgm to enhance the depth sharpness. Unfortunately,
we find this loss term fails to bring evident improvement when the model is trained on labeled real
datasets. We speculate that, the sparse and coarse groundtruth label in real datasets cannot provide
fine-grained supervision, even with this explicit regularization. To check this, we further apply and
ablate this loss term on synthetic training datasets, whose labels are complete and highly precise.
We gradually increase the loss weight of Lgm and observe the corresponding depth sharpness. As
shown in Figure 10, when the weight is increased from the default 0.5 to 4.0, the sharpness is steadily
improved. We finally set the weight as 2.0 to trade off between the metric results and sharpness.

B.8
Test-time resolution scaling up

By default, we test images at the same resolution as that used in training, i.e., resizing the shorter
size to 518 with the aspect ratio kept. This is a common practice to achieve the optimal performance.
However, we surprisingly find that our model has the property of “test-time resolution scaling up”. It
means we can almost freely increase the image resolution at test time to produce more fine-grained
depth maps. As shown in Figure 11, when gradually adjusting the resolution by 2× and 4× of the
base resolution (518), the depth sharpness is also gradually improved.

B.9
Harm of real labeled images to fine-grained predictions

According to the ablation study in Depth Anything V1 [89], HRWSI [83] is the best-performed real
training dataset. We attempt to add it to our synthetic training sets. However, as shown in Figure 12,
we find although it only accounts for 5% of the total training images, its coarse depth labels have a
huge negative impact on the original fine-grained predictions. So we choose to use purely synthetic
images to train our largest teacher model to ensure the supervision preciseness.

Qualitative comparison between our metric depth models and ZoeDepth

We fine-tune our finally released metric depth models purely on synthetic datasets, such as Hy-
persim [58] and Virtual KITTI [9]. In Figure 15, we compare our metric depth predictions with
ZoeDepth, which is trained on real datasets like NYUv2 [70].

B.13
Qualitative comparison between w/ and w/o pseudo-labeled real images

Please refer to Figure 16. As shown, purely trained on precise synthetic images, the DINOv2-small-
based model suffers severe generalization problem. However, when trained on the high-quality
and diverse pseudo-labeled real images, even the small model (25M parameters) exhibits powerful
generalization capability to complex scenes.

C.2
Comparison with the DIW dataset

Although DIW [11] and our DA-2K use the same annotation format (both sparse pixel pairs, we are
inspired by DIW), our proposed DA-2K dataset is better in four aspects:

• (more precise) DIW is very noisy. For most pairs in DIW, we cannot decide the relative
depth or hold the opposite opinion as the provided label. This can also be supported by
MiDaS [7] that, better and larger models instead perform worse on DIW. In comparison, our
DA-2K is precise, because we exclude many hard-to-decide or controversial pairs.

• (better organized) DIW randomly downloads images from Flickr, without carefully organiz-
ing. This would make users struggle to obtain straightforward insights from the evaluation
results. In comparison, our DA-2K organizes all images by application scenarios, and thus
can provide results for each individual application scenario.

22


---Page Break---
• (more diverse) DIW images are typically collected from real life. However, considering the
widespread application of MDE models in AIGC [101, 39], we provide additional non-real
images, such as AI-generated images, cartoon images, etc..
• (high-resolution) Most images in DIW have a low resolution of around 300×500, while we
provide mostly 1500×2000 high-resolution images.

C.3
Annotation details

To alleviate the burden of human annotators and avoid hard-to-decide pairs, we only pop out pixel
pairs whose predicted depth ratio is larger than 3. For the evaluation scenarios of “transparent” and
“object”, we do not rely on model disagreement to pop out pairs. We simply manually analyze
the images and select challenging pairs suited to the scenario. For other scenarios, we adopt both
selection pipelines (i.e., automatic disagreement-based selection and manual selection). In Table 15.
we list the keywords we use to download images for each evaluation scenario.

Limitations

Currently, we use 62M unlabeled images for training. The computational burden is very heavy. Thus,
in the future, we will study how to leverage such large-scale visual data more efficiently. Moreover,
the current synthetic training sets are not diverse enough. We will attempt to collect synthetic images
from more sources to train a more capable teacher model for better pseudo labeling.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the work in the section of conclusion and
limitation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involves theoretical result.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed information about experiments in the appendix and provide
the source code that can reproduce reported results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

32


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will release of code and data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We specify all the training and test details in the main text and appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We follow the convention in prior works and report the performance number
on the standard benchmarks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

33


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provided sufficient information on the computer resources in the main text
and appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: the research conducted in the paper conformed, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

34


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe safeguards for responsible release of models in the social impacts
section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We properly credited the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data,
models), used in the paper and conformed the license and terms.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

35


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We communicated the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submission.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve study participants.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve study participants.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

36


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
