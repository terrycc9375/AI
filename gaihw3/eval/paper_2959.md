Abstract

Foundation models are becoming valuable tools in medicine. Yet despite their
promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex
medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent frame-
work, named Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) that helps to address
this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs.
The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at
hand, a simple emulation inspired by the way real-world medical decision-making
processes are adapted to tasks of different complexities. We evaluate our frame-
work and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world
medical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison of
LLMs’ medical complexity classification against human physicians2. MDAgents
achieved the best performance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring
an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a sig-
nificant improvement of up to 4.2% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods’ best
performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medi-
cal complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks.
Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in
group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy improvement of 11.8%. Our

Introduction
Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a multifaceted and intricate process in which clinicians collabo-
ratively navigate diverse sources of information to reach a precise and specific conclusion [97]. For
instance, a primary care physician (PCP) may refer a patient to a specialist when faced with a complex
case, or a patient visiting the emergency department or urgent care might be triaged and then directed
to a specialist for further evaluation [5, 54]. MDM involves interpreting complex and multi-modal
data, such as imaging, electronic health records (EHR), physiological signals, and genetic informa-
tion, while rapidly integrating new medical research into clinical practice [68, 78]. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for AI support in MDM [22, 37, 48, 64, 72, 90]. It
is known that they are able to process and synthesize large volumes of medical literature [74] and
clinical information [1], as well as support probabilistic [94] and causal [39] reasoning, makes LLMs
promising tools. However, there is no silver bullet in medical applications that require careful design.

Figure 1: Medical Decision-Making Agents (MDAgents) framework. Given a medical query from
different medical datasets, the framework performs 1) medical complexity check, 2) recruitment, 3)
analysis and synthesis, and 4) decision-making steps.

While decision-making tools including multi-agent LLMs [11, 86] have shown promise in non-
medical domains [31, 32, 44, 46, 62, 65], their evaluation in health applications has been limited.
To date, their “generalist” design has not effectively integrated the real-world systematic MDM
process [57] which requires an adaptive, collaborative, and tiered approach. Clinicians consider the
current and past history of the patient, available evidence from medical literature, and their domain
expertise and experience [20] for MDM. One example of MDM is to triage patients in emergency
room based on the severity and complexity of their medical conditions [12, 26, 87]. Patients with
pathognomonic, single uncomplicated acute conditions, or stable chronic conditions that their PCP
could manage [85] could be low complexity cases. On the other hand, patients with injuries that
involve multiple organs, chronic conditions with side effects, or superimposed diseases who often
require multiple collaborative discussions (MDT) or sequential consultations (ICT) among specialty
physicians [27, 61] are considered high complexity cases 3.
Inspired by the way that clinicians make decisions in practice, we propose Medical Decision-making
Agents (MDAgents), an adaptive medical decision-making framework that leverages LLMs to
emulate the hierarchical diagnosis procedures ranging from individual clinicians to collaborative
clinician teams (Figure 1). MDAgents work in three steps: 1) Medical complexity check; 2)
Recruitment based on medical complexity; 3) Analysis and synthesis and 4) Final decision-making to
return the answer. Our contributions are threefold:
1. We introduce MDAgents, the first adaptive decision-making framework for LLMs that mirrors
real-world MDM processes via dynamic collaboration among AI agents based on task complexity.
2. MDAgents demonstrate superior performance in accuracy over previous solo and group methods
on 7 out of 10 medical benchmarks, and we show an effective trade-off between performance and
efficiency (i.e. the number of API calls) by varying the number of agents.
3. We provide rigorous testing under various hyperparameters (e.g. temperatures), demonstrating
better robustness of MDAgents compared to solo and group methods. Furthermore, our ablations
evidence MDAgents’ ability to find the appropriate complexity level for each MDM instance.

Language Models in Medical Decision-Making
LLMs have shown promise in a range of ap-
plications within the medical field [14, 37, 40, 48, 63, 75, 76, 90, 96]. They can answer questions
from medical exams [43, 52], perform biomedical research [36], clinical risk prediction [37], and
clinical diagnosis [55, 67]. Medical LLMs are also evaluated on generative tasks, including creating
medical reports [79], describing medical images [81], constructing differentials [53], performing
diagnostic dialogue with patients [77], and generating psychiatric evaluations of interviews [24]. To
advance the capabilities of medical LLMs, two main approaches have been explored: (1) training with

domain-specific data [28], and (2) applying inference-time techniques such as prompt engineering
[67] and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [92]. While initial research has been concentrated
on pre-training and fine-tuning with medical knowledge, the rise of large general-purpose LLMs has
enabled training-free methods where models leverage their latent medical knowledge. For example,
GPT-4 [60], with richer prompt crafting, surpasses the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and
with prompt tuning can outperform fine-tuned models including Med-PaLM [58, 59]. The promise
of general-purpose models has thus inspired various techniques such as Medprompt and ensemble
refinement to improve LLM reasoning [67], as well as RAG tools that use external resources to
improve the factuality and completeness of LLM responses [38, 92]. Frameworks like MEDIQ
[49] and UoT [33] advance LLM reliability in clinical settings by enhancing information-seeking
through adaptive question-asking and uncertainty reduction, supporting more realistic diagnostic
processes. Our approach leverages these techniques and the capabilities of general-purpose models
while acknowledging that a solitary LLM [37, 48, 90] may not fully encapsulate the collaborative
and multidisciplinary nature of real-world MDM. We thus emphasize joinging multiple expert LLMs
for effective collaboration in order to solve complicated medical tasks with greater accuracy.
Multi-Agent Collaboration
An array of studies have explored effective collaboration frameworks
between multiple LLM agents [47, 86] to enhance capability above and beyond an individual LLM
[80]. A common framework is role-playing, where each agent adopts a specific role (e.g. an Assistant
Agent or a Manager Agent), a task is then broken down into sub-steps and solved collaboratively
[47, 86]. While role-playing focuses on collaboration and multi-step problem-solving [88], another
framework, “multi-agent debate”, prompts each agent to solve the task independently [17]. Then, they
reason through other agents’ answers to converge on a shared response, this approach can improve
the factuality, mathematical ability and reasoning capabilities of the multi-agent solution [17, 50].
Similar frameworks include voting [82], multi-disciplinary collaboration [72], group discussions
(ReConcile [10]), and negotiating [23]. Table 1 compares existing setups across key dimensions
in multi-agent interaction. Although these frameworks have shown improvement in the respective
tasks, they rely on a pre-determined number of agents and interaction settings. When applied on a
wider variety of tasks , this static architecture may lead to suboptimal multi-agent configurations,
negatively impacting performance [51]. Furthermore, multi-agent approaches run the risk of being
computationally inefficient or expensive to employ and need to justify these costs with noticable
performance gains [17]. Given that different models and frameworks could generalize better to
different tasks [93], we propose a framework that dynamically assigns the optimal collaboration
strategy at inference time based on the complexity of the query. We apply our strategy to MDM, a
task that requires teamwork and should benefit from multi-agent collaboration [72].

MDAgents: Medical Decision-making Agents
The design of MDAgents (Figures 1 and 2) incorporates four stages: 1) Medical Complexity Check
- The system evaluates the medical query, categorizing it as low, moderate, or high complexity
based on clinical decision-making techniques [6, 7, 21, 71, 84]. 2) Expert Recruitment - Based on
complexity, the framework activates a single Primary Care Clinician (PCC) for low complexity issues,
or a Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) or Integrated Care Team (ICT) for moderate or high complexities
[7, 18, 21, 34, 45, 71]. 3) Analysis and Synthesis - Solo queries use prompting techniques like
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency (SC). MDTs involve multiple LLM agents forming a
consensus, while ICTs synthesize information for the most complex cases. 4) Decision-making -
The final stage synthesizes all inputs to provide a well-informed answer to the medical query.

Agent 3 (Surgeon      ) and Agent 4 (Oncologist      ) seem to align more closely with

3.1
Agent Roles
Moderator.
The moderator agent functions as a general practitioner (GP) or emergency department
doctor who first triages the medical query. This agent assesses the complexity of the problem and
determines whether it should be handled by a single agent, a MDT, or an ICT. The moderator
ensures the appropriate pathway be selected based on the query’s complexity and oversees the entire
decision-making process.
Recruiter.
The recruiter agent is responsible for assembling the appropriate team of specialist
agents based on the complexity assessment of the moderator. The recruiter may assign a single
PCP agent for low-complexity cases, while MDT or ICT with relevant expertise will be formed for
moderate and high-complexity cases.
General Doctor/Specialist.
These agents are domain-specific or general physicians recruited by
the recruiter agent. Depending on the complexity of the case, they may work independently or as part
of a team. General physicians handle less complex, routine cases, whereas specialists are recruited
for their specific expertise in more complex scenarios. These agents engage in the collaborative
decision-making process, contributing their specialized knowledge to reach a consensus or provide
detailed reports for high-complexity cases.
3.2
Medical Complexity Classification (Line 1 of Algorithm 1, Appendix C.2)
The first step in the MDAgents framework is to determine the complexity of a given medical query q
by the moderator LLM which functions as a generalist practitioner (GP). The moderator aims to
act as a classifier to return the complexity level of the given medical query, it is provided with the
information on how medical complexity should be defined and is instructed to classify the query into
one of three different complexity levels:
1. Low - Simple, well-defined medical issues that can be resolved by a single PCP agent. These
typically include common, acute illnesses or stable chronic conditions where the medical needs
are predictable and require minimal interdisciplinary coordination.
2. Moderate - The medical issues involve multiple interacting factors, necessitating a collaborative
approach among an MDT. These scenarios require integration of diverse medical knowledge areas
and coordination between specialists through consultation to develop effective care strategies.
3. High - Complex medical scenarios that demand extensive coordination and combined expertise
from an ICT. These cases often involve multiple chronic conditions, complicated surgical or trauma
cases, and decision-makings that integrates specialists from different healthcare departments.
3.3
Expert Recruitment (Line 3, 7, 17 of Algorithm 1)
Given a medical query, the goal of the recruiter LLM is to enlist domain experts as individuals, in
groups, or as multiple teams, based on the complexity levels determined by the moderator LLM.
Specifically, we assign medical expertise and roles to multiple LLMs, instructing them to either act
independently as solo medical agents or collaborate with other medical experts in a team. In Figure 9
in the Appendix, we also provide frequently recruited agents for each benchmark as a reference.

3.4
Medical Collaboration and Refinement
The initial assessment protocol of our decision-making framework categorizes query complexity into
low, moderate, and high. This categorization is grounded in established medical constructs such as
acuity [25] for straightforward cases, comorbidity [69] and case management complexity [13] for
intermediate and multi-disciplinary care requirements, and severity of illness [16] for high complexity
cases requiring comprehensive management. We outlines the specific refinement approach:
Low - Straightforward cases (Line 2-4 of Algorithm 1).
For queries classified under Low com-
plexity, characterized by straightforward clinical decision pathways, a single PCP agent (Figure 10
(a)) is deployed by the definition in Section 3.2. The domain expert who is recruited by recuriter
LLM, applies few-shot prompting to the problem. The output answer, denoted as ans, is directly
obtained from the agent’s response to Q without the need for iterative refinement, formalized as
ans = Agent(Q), with Agent representing the engaged PCP agent.
Moderate - Intermediate complexity cases (Line 6-14 of Algorithm 1).
In addressing more
complex queries, the utilization of an MDT (Figure 10 (b) and (c)) approach has been increasingly
recognized for its effectiveness in producing comprehensive and nuanced solutions [45]. The MDT
framework leverages the collective expertise of professionals from diverse disciplines, facilitating
a holistic examination of the query at hand. This collaborative method is particularly advanta-
geous in scenarios where the complexity of a problem transcends the scope of a single domain,
necessitating a fusion of insights from various specialties [7, 71]. The MDT approach not only
enhances decision-making quality through the integration of multidimensional perspectives but also
significantly improves the adaptability and efficiency of the problem-solving process [21].
Building upon this foundation, our framework specifically addresses queries of moderate complexity
through a structured, multi-tiered collaborative approach. An MDT recruited by recruiter LLM (see
Figure 10 in Appendix) starts an iterative discussion process aimed at reaching a consensus with at
most R rounds (Line 10-12). For each round r ∈R, agents Ai, i ∈1, . . . , N indicate participation
and preferred interlocutors. The system facilitates message exchanges for T turns. If consensus is not
reached and agents agree to continue, a new round begins with access to previous conversations. For
every round, consensus within the MDT is determined by parsing and comparing their opinions. In
the event of a disagreement, the moderator agent, consistent with the one described in Section 3.2
reviews the MDT’s discourse and formulates feedback for each agent.

High - Complex care cases (Line 17-24 of Algorithm 1).
In contrast to the MDT approach, the ICT
(Figure 10 (d)) paradigm is essential for addressing the highest tier of query complexity in healthcare.
This structured progression through the ICT ensures a depth of analysis that is specialized and focused
at each stage of the decision-making process. Beginning with the Initial Assessment Team, moving
through various diagnostic teams, and culminating with the Final Review & Decision Team, our ICT
model aligns specialist insights into a cohesive narrative that informs the ultimate decision (Appendix
Algorithms 1 Lines 19-21). A key component of this process is the report generation process described
in Appendix with the prompt, where each team, led by a lead clinician, collaboratively produces
a comprehensive report synthesizing their findings. This phased approach, supported by evidence
from recent healthcare studies, has been shown to enhance the precision of clinical decision-making,
as each team builds upon the foundation laid by the previous, ensuring a meticulous and refined
examination of complex medical cases [34]. The resultant reports, accumulating throughout the ICT
process, are not only reflective of comprehensive medical evaluations but also of a systematic and
layered analysis that is critical in the management of intricate health scenarios [18].

3.5
Decision-making
In the final stage of our framework, the decision-maker agent synthesizes the diverse inputs generated
throughout the decision-making process to arrive at a well-informed final answer to the medical query
q. This synthesis involves several components depending on the complexity level of the query:
1. Low: Directly utilizes the initial response from the primary decision-making agent.
2. Moderate: Incorporates the conversation history (Interaction) between the recruited agents to
understand the nuances and disagreements in their responses.
3. High: Considers detailed reports (Reports) generated by the agents, which include comprehensive
analyses and justifications for their diagnostic suggestions.
The decision-making process is formulated as ans = Agent(·) where the final answer, ans is deter-
mined by integrating the outputs from analysis and synthesis step based on its medical complexities.
This integration employs ensemble techniques such as temperature ensembles to ensure the decision
is robust and reflects a consensus among the models when applicable (see Appendix C.2 for details).

in Solo, Group, and Aaptive settings. Our experiments and ablation studies highlight the framework’s
performance, demonstrating robustness and efficiency by modulating agent numbers and temperatures.
Results also show a beneficial convergence of agent opinions in collaborative settings.
4.1
Setup
To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments with baseline
methods on ten datasets including MedQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, SymCat, JAMA, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, PMC-VQA, MIMIC-CXR and MedVidQA. A detailed explanation and statistics for each
dataset are deferred to Appendix A and Figure 8. We use 50 samples per dataset for testing, and the
inference time for each complexity was: low - 14.7s, moderate - 95.5s, and high - 226s in average.
For all the quantitative experiments in this section, we compare three settings: (1) Solo: Using a single
LLM agent in the decision-making state. (2) Group: Implementing multi-agents to collaborate during
the decision-making process. (3) Adaptive: Our proposed method MDAgents, adaptively constructs
the inference structure from PCP to MDT and ICT. We use 3-shot prompting for low-complexity
cases and zero-shot prompting for moderate and high-complexity cases across all settings.
Medical Question Answering
With MedQA [35], PubMedQA [36], MedBullets [9], and JAMA
[9], we focus on question answering through text, involving both literature-based and conceptual
medical knowledge questions. Specifically, PubMedQA tasks models to answer questions using
abstracts from PubMed, requiring synthesis of biomedical information. MedQA tests the model’s
ability to understand and respond to multiple-choice questions derived from medical educational
materials and examinations. MedBullets provides USMLE Step 2/3 type questions that demand

the application of medical knowledge and clinical reasoning. JAMA Clinical Challenge presents
challenging real-world clinical cases with diagnosis or treatment decision-making questions, testing
the model’s clinical reasoning (Figure 8 in Appendix shows complexity distribution for each dataset)
Diagnostic Reasoning
DDXPlus [73] and SymCat [2] involve clinical vignettes that require
differential diagnosis, closely mimicking the diagnostic process of physicians. These tasks test the
model’s ability to reason through symptoms and clinical data to suggest possible medical conditions,
evaluating the AI’s diagnostic reasoning abilities similar to a clinical setting. SymCat [2] uses
synthetic patient records constructed from a public disease-symptom data source and is enhanced
with additional contextual information through the NLICE method.
Medical Visual Interpretation
Path-VQA [30], PMC-VQA [95], MedVidQA [29], and MIMIC-
CXR [3] challenge models to interpret medical images and videos, requiring integration of visual
data with clinical knowledge. PathVQA focuses on answering questions based on pathology images,
testing AI’s capability to interpret complex visual information from medical images. PMC-VQA
evaluates AI’s proficiency in deriving answers from both text and images found in scientific publi-
cations. MedVidQA extends to video-based content, where AI models need to process information
from medical procedure videos. MIMIC-CXR-VQA specifically targets chest radiographs, utilizing a
diverse and large-scale dataset designed for visual question-answering tasks in the medical domain.
Baseline Methods
• Solo: The baseline methods considered for the Solo setting include the following: Zero-shot [41]
directly incorporates a prompt to facilitate inference, while Few-shot [8] involves a small number of
examples. Few-shot CoT [83] integrates rationales before deducing the answer. Few-shot CoT-SC
[82] builds upon Few-shot CoT by sampling multiple chains to yield the majority answer. Ensemble
Refinement (ER) [67] is a prompting strategy that conditions model responses on multiple reasoning
paths to bolster the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Medprompt [59] is a composition of several
prompting strategies that enhances the performance of LLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results
on multiple benchmark datasets, including medical and non-medical domains.
• Group: We tested five group decision-making methods: Voting [82], MedAgents [72], Reconcile
[10], AutoGen [86], and DyLAN [51]. Autogen was based on four agents, with one User, one
Clinician, one Medical Expert, and one Moderator, with one response per agent [86]. DyLAN setup
followed the base implementations of four agents with no specific roles and four maximum rounds
of interaction [51]. While the methods support multiple models, GPT-4 was used for all agents.

4.2
Results
In Table 2, we report the classification accuracy on MedQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, SymCat, JAMA,
MedBullets, Path-VQA, PMC-VQA and MedVidQA dataset. We compare our method (Adaptive)
with several baselines in both Solo and Group settings.
Adaptive method outperforms Solo and Group settings.
As depicted in Figure 4 and Table 2,
MDAgents significantly outperforms (p < 0.05) both Solo and Group setting methods, showing best
performance in 7 out of 10 medical benchmarks tested. This reveals the effectiveness of adaptive
strategies integrated within our system, particularly when navigating through the text-only (e.g.,
DDXPlus where it outperformed the best performance of single-agent by 5.2% and multi-agent by
9.5%) and text-image datasets (e.g., Path-VQA, PMC-VQA and MIMIC-CXR). Our approach not
only comprehends textual information with high precision but also adeptly synthesizes visual data, a
pivotal capability in medical diagnostic evaluations.

Why Do Adaptive Decision-making Framework Work Well?
It is important to accurately assign
difficulty levels to medical questions. For instance, if a medical question is obviously easy, utilizing a
team of specialists (such as an IDT) might be excessive and potentially lead to overly pessimistic
approaches. Conversely, if a difficult medical question is only tackled by a PCP, the problem might
not be adequately addressed. The core issue here is the LLM’s capability to classify the difficulty of
medical questions appropriately. If an LLM inaccurately classifies the difficulty level, the chosen
medical solution may not be suitable, potentially leading to the wrong decision making. Therefore,
understanding what constitutes an appropriate difficulty level is essential.

We hypothesize that an LLM, functioning as a classifier, will select the optimal complexity level
for each MDM problem. This hypothesis is supported by Figure 3, which illustrates that the model
appropriately matches the complexity levels; low, moderate, and high of the given problem. To
determine this, we assessed the accuracy of solutions across various difficulty levels. Specifically, we
evaluated 25 medical problems by repeating each problem for 10 times at each difficulty level. By
measuring the success rate, we aimed to identify the difficulty level that yielded the highest accuracy.
This approach ensures that the LLM’s complexity classification aligns with the most effective and
accurate medical solutions, thereby optimizing the application of medical expertise to each question.
Formally, for any given problem P, we denote the probability that the correct answer can be solved
at a specific complexity level as pcomplexity-level(P), where complexity-level ∈{low, moderate, high}.
arg max(P) ∈{low, moderate, high} refers to the complexity level that has the highest proba-
bility among plow(P), pmoderate(P), and phigh(P). Similarly, arg min(P) is the complexity level
with the lowest probability, and arg mid(P) is the one with the middle probability. We denote
a, b, and c as the probabilities that the LLM selects the complexity levels corresponding to
arg max, arg mid, and arg min, respectively. Thus, the accuracy of our system for problem P
can be described by a · parg max(P) + b · parg mid(P) + c · parg min(P), and the overall accuracy is
given by EP [a · parg max(P) + b · parg mid(P) + c · parg min(P)]. The estimated values of a, b, c are
a = 0.81 ± 0.29, b = 0.11 ± 0.28, and c = 0.08 ± 0.16, which indicates that LLM can provide an
optimal complexity level with probability at least 80%.
These findings suggest that a classifier LLM can implicitly simulate various complexity levels and
optimally adapt to the complexity required for each medical problem, as shown in Figure 3. This
ability to adjust complexity dynamically proves to be crucial for applying LLMs effectively in MDM
contexts as shown by the competitiveness of our Adaptive approach.

Figure 4: Our method outperforms Solo and Group
settings across different medical benchmarks.

Solo vs. Group Setting in MDM.
The ex-
perimental results reveal distinct performance
patterns between Solo and Group settings across
various medical benchmarks. In simpler datasets
like MedQA, solo methods, leveraging Few-shot
CoT and CoT-SC, achieved up to 83.9% accu-
racy compared to the group’s best of 81.3%.
Conversely, for more complex datasets like Sym-
Cat, group settings perform better, with SymCat
showing 91.9% accuracy in the group settings
versus 88.7% in solo settings. Notably, group
settings (e.g. Weighted Voting, Reconcile) per-
formed better in multi-modal datasets such as
Path-VQA (image + text), MedVidQA (video
+ text), and MIMIC-CXR (image + text), high-
lighting the advantage of collaborative process in complex tasks. This result aligns with findings from
[4], which showed that pooled diagnoses from groups of physicians significantly outperformed those
of individual physicians, with accuracy increasing as group size increased. Overall, solo settings
outperformed group settings in four benchmarks, while group settings outperformed solo in six
benchmarks. These results reveals that while solo methods excel in straightforward tasks, group
settings provide better performance in complex, multi-faceted tasks requiring diverse expertise.
4.3
Ablation Studies
Impact of Complexity Selection.
We evaluate the importance of the complexity assessment and
adaptive process through ablation studies (Figure 5). Our adaptive method significantly outperforms
static complexity assignments across different modality benchmarks. For text-only queries, the
Adaptive method achieves an accuracy of 81.2%, significantly higher than low (64.2%), moderate
(71.6%), and high (65.8%) settings. Interestingly, 64% of the text-only queries were classified as

---Page Break---
high complexity, indicating that many text-based queries required in-depth analysis with different
expertise. In the image + text modality, the Adaptive method classified 55% of the queries as low
complexity, suggesting that the visual information often provides clear and straightforward cues that
simplify the decision-making process. Finally, for video + text queries, 87% of these queries were
classified as low complexity, reflecting that the dynamic visual data in conjunction with text can often
be straightforwardly interpreted. However, further evaluation on more challenging video medical
datasets is needed, as MedVidQA contains relatively less complex medical knowledge.

Table 3 ex-
amines the impact of incorpo-

edge and moderator reviews
into the MDAgents framework
on accuracy. MedRAG [89]
is a systematic toolkit for
Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion (RAG) that leverages various corpora; biomedical, clinical and general medicine, to provide
comprehensive knowledge. The baseline accuracy of MDAgents is 71.8%. Integrating MedRAG
increases accuracy to 75.2% (up 4.7%), while the moderator’s review alone raises it to 77.6% (up
8.1%). The combined use of both methods achieves the highest accuracy at 80.3% (up 11.8%).
The results indicate that MedRAG and moderator review both enhance performance, with their
combined effect being synergistic. This highlights that leveraging recent external knowledge and
structured feedback mechanisms is crucial for refining and converging on accurate medical decisions.
This improvement underscores the importance of a hybrid strategy, aligning with real-world practices
of continuous learning and expert consultation to optimize performance in medical applications.

4.4
Impact of Number of Agents in Group Setting.
Our experiment with varying the number of agents in a collaborative Group setting (Appendix Figure
6 (a-b)) shows that a higher number of agents does not lead to better performance. Rather, our
Adaptive method achieves optimal performance with fewer agents (N=3, peak accuracy of 83.5%)
by intelligently calibrating the number of collaborating agents. This not only indicates efficiency in
decision-making but also computational and economic benefits, considering the reduced number of
API calls needed, especially when contrasted with the Solo and Group settings.
With regards to computational efficiency, the Solo setting (5-shot CoT-SC) resulted in a 6.0 and
Group setting (MedAgents with N=5) resulted in a 20.3 API calls, suggesting a high computational
cost without a corresponding increase in accuracy. On the other hand, our Adaptive method exhibits a
more economical use of resources, demonstrated by fewer API calls (9.3 with N=3) while maintaining
high accuracy, a critical factor in deploying scalable and cost-effective medical AI solutions.

4.5
Robustness of MDAgents with different parameters.
Our Adaptive approach shows resilience to changes in temperature (Appendix Figure 6 (c), low
(T=0.3) and high (T=1.2)) with performance improving under higher temperatures. This suggests
that our model can utilize the creative and diverse outputs generated at higher temperatures to
enhance decision-making, a property that is not as pronounced in the Solo and Group conditions.
This robustness is particularly valuable in real-world medical domains with high uncertainty and
ambiguity in datasets [15]. Additionally, studies have shown that creative diagnostic approaches

can mitigate cognitive biases and improve diagnostic accuracy [66], while fostering flexibility and
adaptability in decision-making [19]. These insights support the enhanced performance observed
under higher temperatures in our framework. However, the future work should explore a wider range
of temperatures to fully understand the robustness and adaptability of our approach.
4.6
Convergence Trends in Consensus Dynamics
There is clear trend towards consensus among MDAgents cross various data modalities (Figure 7).
The text+video modality demonstrates a rapid convergence, reflecting the agents’ efficient processing
of combined textual and visual cues. On the other hand, the text+image and text-only modalities
display a more gradual decline in entropy, indicating a progressive narrowing of interpretative
diversity among the agents. Despite the differing rates and initial conditions, all modalities exhibit
convergence of agent opinions over time. This uniformity in reaching consensus highlights the
MDAgents’ capability to integrate and reconcile information. Please refer to Appendix B for a
detailed explanation of the entropy calculation.

Conclusion

This paper introduces MDAgents, a framework designed to enhance the utility of LLMs in complex
medical decision-making by dynamically structuring effective collaboration models. To reflect the
nuanced consultation aspects in clinical settings, MDAgents adaptively assigns LLMs either to roles
independently or within groups, depending on the task’s complexity. This emulation of real-world
medical decision processes has been comprehensively evaluated, with MDAgents outperforming
previous solo and group methods in 7 out of 10 medical benchmarks. The case study illustrates the
practical efficacy and collaborative dynamics of our proposed framework, providing insights into
how differing expert opinions are synthesized to reach a more accurate diagnosis. This is evidenced
by our agents’ ability to converge on the correct diagnosis despite initially divergent perspectives.
Ablation studies further elucidate the individual contributions of agents and strategies within the
system, revealing the critical components and interactions that drive the framework’s success. By
harnessing the strength of multi-modal reasoning and fostering a collaborative process among LLM
agents, our framework opens up new possibilities for enhancing LLM-assisted medical diagnosis
systems, pushing the boundaries of automated clinical reasoning.

Limitations and Future Works

Despite the successes of our framework in showing promising performance in medical decision-
making tasks, we recognize several limitations that open pathways for future research.

Medical Focused Foundation Models.
An essential enhancement would be to incorporate the
foundation models and systems specifically trained on medical data, like Med-Gemini [63], AMIE
[77], and Med-PaLM 2 [67]. These models excel in generating professional medical terminologies,
which can facilitate more effective and accurate communication between multiple agents involved in
the decision-making process. By leveraging these specialized models, the agents can interact using
a shared, precise medical vocabulary, enhancing the system’s overall performance and reliability.
This approach not only ensures more medically accurate content generation but also supports better
collaboration and understanding among the agents, which is essential for complex medical decision-
making tasks.

Patient-Centered Diagnosis.
A primary limitation lies in the fact that our current framework
operates within the confines of multiple-choice question answering and does not account for the
interactive, patient-centered nature of real-world diagnostics. Effective diagnosis often relies on
continuous exchanges that include the patient’s narrative, the physician’s expertise, and input from
caregivers. To bridge this gap, future iterations of our framework will aim to incorporate a more
interactive system that not only assists physicians but also directly engages with both patients and
caregivers in a multi-stakeholder approach. Moreover, by incorporating regret-aware [91] decision-
making, the system can learn to minimize diagnostic regret over time, refining its responses based
on the outcomes of prior interactions. This regret-aware framework will help guide the LLM to
seek additional information when uncertainties arise, thereby supporting more informed decisions
across complex, multi-stakeholder scenarios. Embedding these real-world interactions within the
feedback loop will enable the system to provide more nuanced and patient-centric support, enhancing
the quality and personalization of medical decision-making across all involved parties.

Potential Risks and Mitigations. While our framework shows promise, potential risks include
medical hallucinations and the generation of inaccurate or misleading information. To address these
risks, integrating self-correction mechanisms, such as those proposed by [42], could enable the model
to autonomously identify and rectify its own errors via reinforcement learning-based self-correction.
Additionally, implementing rule-based reward structures, as suggested in [56], would allow the model
to adhere to specific safety and accuracy guidelines during training. These methods can support a
safer, more reliable diagnostic support tool by introducing corrective feedback loops and standardized
behavior guidelines. Furthermore, integrating confidence scores and uncertainty estimates with the
model’s recommendations could enhance the decision-making process by enabling end-users to
weigh various diagnostic options, ultimately increasing the system’s trustworthiness and safety.

A
Dataset Information

We evaluate multi-agent collaboration frameworks across seven common medical question-answering
datasets, which vary in question complexity. Generally, questions are deemed more complex if they
involve multiple modalities or entail a lengthy, detailed diagnostic task. Below, we detail each dataset
and provide a sample entry:

1. MedQA. The MedQA dataset consists of professional medical board exams from the US,
Mainland China, and Taiwan [35]. Our study focuses on the English test set, comprising
1,273 questions sourced from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).
These questions are formatted as multiple-choice text queries with five options. Due to their
textual nature and brevity, we categorize these questions as low.
Sample Question: “A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves’
disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect
that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the
damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient’s hoarseness?”
Options: A: 1st pharyngeal arch, B: 2nd pharyngeal arch, C: 3rd pharyngeal arch, D: 4th
pharyngeal arch, E: 6th pharyngeal arch

Questions

2. PubMedQA. PubMedQA is a QA dataset based on biomedical research [36]. It requires
yes/no/maybe answers to questions grounded in PubMed abstract. The dataset comprises
entries each containing a question, a relevant abstract minus the conclusion, and a ground
truth label. We used 50 samples for testing. Given its binary choice format, we consider the
complexity of this dataset to be low.
Sample Question: “Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omit-
ted?”
Context: “The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the
aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not
balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI). Sixty
consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where
balloon predilatation was omitted. There were no significant differences between the groups
regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates."

3. DDXPlus. DDXPlus is a medical diagnosis dataset using synthetic patient information and
symptoms [73]. Each instance represents a patient, with attributes including age, sex, initial
evidences, evidence, multiple options of possible pathologies, and a ground truth diagnosis.
Due to its text-only and multiple-choice nature, we consider the complexity to be low.
Sample Patient Information: Age: 96, Sex: F
Evidences: [‘e66’, ‘insp_siffla’, ‘j45’, ‘posttus_emesis’, ‘trav1_@_N’, ‘vaccination’]
Initial evidence: ‘posttus_emesis’
Options: (A) Bronchite (B) Coqueluche

4. PMC-VQA. PMC-VQA is a large-scale medical visual question-answering dataset that
contains 227K Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs of 149K images [95]. It is structured
as a multiple-choice QA task with one image input accompanying each question. Since the
query requires a model to consider both text and image inputs, while maintaining medical
expertise, we consider the complexity to be moderate.
Sample Question: What is the appearance of the hyperintense foci in the basal ganglia on
T1-weighted MRI image?
Image: PMC8415802_FIG1.jpg
Options: A: Hypodense, B: Hyperdense, C: Isointense, D: Hypointense

5. Path-VQA. PathVQA is a VQA dataset specifically on pathology images [30]. Differ-
ent from PMC-VQA which consists of multiple choice questions, Path-VQA includes
open-ended questions and binary "yes/no" questions. For the purpose of maintaining a
standardized accuracy evaluation, we use only the yes/no questions. Similar to PMC-VQA,
we consider the complexity to be moderate.
Sample Question: Was a gravid uterus removed for postpartum bleeding?
Image: test_0273.jpg

6. MedVidQA. MedVidQA dataset consists of 3,010 health-related questions with visual
answers from validated video sources (e.g. medical school, health institutions, etc). We

19

meals::32; Altered stool:Lumpy:::::::Often:44; Flatulence:::::::::30; Bloating:::::::::41
Options: "A": "Asthma", "B": "IBS (Constipation type)", "C": "Viral meningitis (Varicella
zoster virus)", "D": "Bacterial (Gastro)enteritis (Yersinia infection most likely)"
8. JAMA. JAMA includes 1524 clinical cases collected from the JAMA Network Clinical
Challenge archive, which are summaries of actual challenging clinical cases. Each sample
is framed as a question, with a long case description and four options [9].
Sample Case: A 62-year-old woman undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) for kidney failure
due to IgA nephropathy presented to the PD clinic with a 1-day history of severe abdominal
pain and cloudy PD fluid. Seven days prior, she inadvertently broke aseptic technique when
tightening a leaking connection of her PD catheter tubing. On presentation, she was afebrile
and had normal vital signs. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Cloudy fluid that was drained from her PD catheter was sent for laboratory analysis (Table
1).Await peritoneal dialysis fluid culture results before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics.
Sample Question: What Would You Do Next?
"A": "Administer empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics", "B": "Administer
empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics", "C": "Await peritoneal dialysis fluid
culture results before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics", "D": "Send blood cultures"
9. Medbullets. Medbullets comprises 308 USMLE Step 2/3 style questions collected from
open-access tweets on X (formerly Twitter) since April 2022. The difficulty is comparable
to that of Step 2/3 exams, which emulate common clinical scenarios [9].
Sample Question: A 2-week-old boy is evaluated by his pediatrician for abnormal feet. The
patient was born at 39 weeks via vaginal delivery to a G1P1 29-year-old woman. The
patient has been breastfeeding and producing 5 stools/day. He is otherwise healthy. His
temperature is 99.5˘00b0F (37.5˘00b0C), blood pressure is 60/38 mmHg, pulse is 150/min,
respirations are 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A cardiopulmonary
exam is notable for a benign flow murmur. A musculoskeletal exam reveals the findings
shown in Figure A. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options: "A": "Botulinum toxin injections", "B": "Reassurance and reassessment in 1
month", "C": "Serial casting", "D": "Surgical pinning",
10. MIMIC-CXR-VQA. MIMIC-CXR is a large-scale visual question-answering dataset of
377,110 chest radiographs. It was obtained from 227,827 imaging studies sourced from
the BIDMC between 2011-2016. It includes patient identifiers which can be linked to
MIMIC-IV [3].
Sample Question: Are there any abnormalities in the upper mediastinum?

Table 7: Impact of knowledge enhancement on MDAgents performance

We investigated whether simply assigning roles to agents is sufficient for expert-like performance,
and explored the impact of equipping agents with different knowledge using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Table 7 presents the results of these experiments.

These results indicate that while role assignment provides a foundation, augmenting agents with
specific knowledge (using MedRAG) and structured reviews (Moderator’s Review) significantly
enhances their ability to simulate domain expertise. The combination of Moderator’s Review and
MedRAG yielded the best performance, highlighting the synergy between structured collaboration
and domain-specific knowledge retrieval.

D.4
Complexity Assignment and Collaborative Settings

To address the impact of complexity assignment on accuracy and API costs, we conducted additional
experiments focusing on high-complexity cases, particularly in image+text scenarios. Table 8 shows
the results for various collaborative settings.

Table 8: Impact of collaboration settings on high-complexity image+text tasks

These results underscore the importance of multi-turn discussions, particularly in complex cases. The
parallel collaboration with discussion yielded the highest accuracy (59.0%), suggesting that enabling
agents to work simultaneously and engage in dialogue is crucial for handling intricate medical queries.
The significant performance gap between discussion and no-discussion scenarios (45.0% vs. 39.0%
for sequential, and 59.0% vs. 56.0% for parallel) highlights the value of interactive deliberation in
medical decision-making processes.

Figure 8: Complexity Distribution for each dataset classified by GPT-4(V) and Gemini-Pro (Vision)
(for MedVidQA). The plot illustrates the varying levels of medical complexity across datasets,
reflecting the diverse nature of medical question answering, diagnostic reasoning, and medical visual
interpretation tasks. For instance, MedQA is categorized under Medical Knowledge Retrieval due to
their focus on text-based questions and literature synthesis, while MIMIC-CXR, categorized under
Clinical Reasoning and Diagnostic tasks, shows a high complexity distribution due to the need for
interpreting detailed radiographic images (See Section in Section 4.1 for the task categorization)

E.1
Medical Decision Making Case Studies

MDM requires efforts of both individual expertise and collaboration to navigate the complexities of
patient care. Clinicians often face challenging scenarios that necessitate a comprehensive approach,
integrating insights from various specialties to arrive at the best possible outcomes.

E.1.1
Real-World Medical Cases

Below are the real-world example cases that could be classified as low, moderate, to high complexity
cases.

Case 1: Adjusting Medication Dosage for Chronic Disease (Low Complexity)
A 55-year-old
female patient with type 2 diabetes visits her PCP for a routine check-up. The patient has been
taking 500 mg of metformin orally twice a day and has been adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Upon testing with fasting glucose level, the glucose level is above normal. PCP reviewed the current
medical dosage and increased the dosage to manage the blood glucose level of the patient.

Case 2: Differential Diagnosis in the Emergency Department (Moderate Complexity)
A 40-
year-old male patient arrives at the emergency department (ED) with a high fever, severe headache,
and muscle pain, raising concerns about a potential infectious disease. The ED physician conducts an
initial examination but recognizes the need for a more detailed evaluation to identify the underlying
cause. The patient is referred to the infectious disease department for further assessment. An
infectious disease specialist, along with the ED physician, reviews the patient’s symptoms, travel
history, and recent exposures. They collaborate on ordering specific diagnostic tests, including blood
cultures and imaging studies. Through this teamed decision-making process, they diagnose the patient
with dengue fever and promptly initiate appropriate antiviral treatment.

Case 3: Managing Adverse Responses to Medication in Chronic Disease (High Complexity)
A 60-year-old female patient with chronic heart failure has been experiencing new symptoms of
shortness of breath and mild fever, suggesting either a complication due to her chronic heart failure
or a new infection. The urgent care doctor identifies the severity of the situation and promptly refers
the patient to the emergency department of a large hospital, where the patient has triaged to see a
cardiologist and an infectious disease doctor for specialized care. The team conducts a detailed review
of the patient’s medication history and current symptoms, does a physical exam to listen to lung
sounds, and orders a few exams including labs, a chest x-ray, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram.
The team identifies that the patient has pulmonary effusion and upper respiratory viral infection.

E.1.2
Medical Cases from MedQA Dataset

Now, let us look at the cases from the MedQA [35] dataset that illustrate either individual PCP
or teamed decision-making is crucial in managing medical conditions, ranging from low to high
complexity levels of potential cases. These examples highlight the importance of checking the
complexity of the case for proper management.

Case 4: Diagnosis by PCP
The case below with the “Low Complexity” header is classified as low
complexity by a medical doctor. In this case, a PCP can answer this question without consulting a
gastroenterologist. The diagnosis of gastric cancer and management based on the manifestation of
the disease, that has been described in this question and beyond should be from a gastroenterologist.
However, PCPs are expected to have the basic scientific and pathophysiological knowledge that is
related to gastric cancer and use that knowledge to solve this problem.

Case 5: Diagnosis and management by single Pediatric Endocrinologist
The case below with
the “Moderate Complexity” header is classified as moderate complexity by the medical doctor. In
this case, a pediatric endocrinologist (specialist) alone can diagnose a patient and have a treatment
plan. Note that this patient could have been referred to this pediatric endocrinologist by a PCP who is
regularly seeing this patient.

cause of this patient’s examination findings?
Answer:
A) TGF-β
B) IL-6
C) IL-2
D) TNF-β

Low Complexity

Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her mother for excessive hair growth. Her mother
reports that for the past 2 months she has noticed hair at the axillary and pubic areas. She denies any
family history of precocious puberty and reports that her daughter has been relatively healthy with an
uncomplicated birth history. She denies any recent illnesses, weight change, fever, vaginal bleeding, pain,
or medication use. Physical examination demonstrates Tanner stage 4 development. A pelvic ultrasound
shows an ovarian mass. Laboratory studies demonstrate an elevated level of estrogen. What is the most
likely diagnosis?
Answer:
A) Granulosa cell tumor
B) Idiopathic precocious puberty
C) McCune-Albright syndrome
D) Sertoli-Leydig tumor

Moderate Complexity

Case 6: Diagnosis and management by multidisciplinary team
The case below is of a “High
Complexity” patient primarily having neurological symptoms but with problems with vision, which
requires a neurologist to consult to ophthalmology department for further evaluation.

Question: A 63-year-old woman presents to her primary-care doctor for a 2-month history of vision
changes, specifically citing the gradual onset of double vision. Her double vision is present all the time
and does not get better or worse throughout the day. She has also noticed that she has a hard time
keeping her right eye open, and her right eyelid looks ’droopy’ in the mirror. Physical exam findings
during primary gaze are shown in the photo. Her right pupil is 6 mm and poorly reactive to light. The
rest of her neurologic exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show an Hb A1c of 5.0%. Which of the
following is the next best test for this patient?
Answer:
A) Direct fundoscopy
B) Intraocular pressures
C) MR angiography of the head
D) Temporal artery biopsy

In the image, the red arrow points to an area of the tissue that is dark red and appears to be 
surrounded by a thin rim of white tissue. This is consistent with the appearance of 
hemorrhage.

I am confident in my opinion because I have extensive experience in diagnosing and treating 
cancer. I have seen many cases of hemorrhage, and I am familiar with the appearance of this 
condition.

I would like to discuss my interpretation of the image with you. I believe that the image shows 
hemorrhage. I am confident that we can come to a consensus on the diagnosis.

Round 1

Step 1. Complexity Check

Intermediate

While the identification of gross pathology 

might seem straightforward to a specialist in 

pathology, the distinction between fibrosis, 

hemorrhage, and other conditions can 

sometimes be subtle and subject to 

interpretation, as evidenced by the detailed 

discussion and disagreement among the 

agents with different medical backgrounds in 

the provided scenario.

Turn 1

(2) → (3)
: I am a radiologist who focuses on the interpretation of 
medical imaging, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and 
ultrasounds. I have extensive experience in diagnosing and 
treating a wide range of medical conditions using medical 
imaging.

I believe that the image demonstrates (A) fibrosis (red 
arrow). Fibrosis is a common finding in myelolipomas, 
which are benign tumors composed of mature fat cells and 
hematopoietic tissue. (C) Hemorrhage, on the other hand, 
is less common and typically appears as a dark red or 
black area on imaging. 

I am confident in my interpretation of the image and believe 
that the surgeon may have misinterpreted the findings.

Turn 2
Turn 2

I do not want to talk to any other experts.

I am confident in my opinion that the image shows 
(C) hemorrhage. I have carefully considered the 
opinions of the other medical experts, but I believe 
that the area pointed to by the red arrow is more 
consistent with the appearance of hemorrhage than 
fibrosis.

I am open to discussing my opinion further with the 
other medical experts, but I do not believe that it is 
necessary to talk to any other experts at this time.

(3) → (2)
: I am a surgeon who specializes in surgical 
procedures for various medical conditions.

I believe that the image shows (C) hemorrhage 
(red arrow). Hemorrhage is the escape of blood 
from a blood vessel. It can occur due to a variety of 
factors, including trauma, bleeding disorders, and 
certain medical conditions. 

(…)

Turn 1
Turn 2

Step 5. Review and Final Decision

The decision is challenging due to the conflicting interpretations of the image. However, the 

arguments for hemorrhage by Agent 3 (Surgeon) and Agent 4 (Oncologist) are based on the visual 

characteristics that are grossly consistent with hemorrhage – specifically, the dark red area 

suggested by the red arrow. In clinical practice, the appearance of hemorrhage in a gross section is 

often a dark red coloration, which is indeed what the image seems to display.

While the expertise of Agent 1 (Pathologist) in tissue examination is crucial and their argument for 

fibrosis is noted, the gross pathological features described by Agent 3 (Surgeon) and Agent 4 

(Oncologist) seem to align more closely with the typical presentation of a hemorrhage. 

Furthermore, hemorrhage is a well-documented complication in myelolipomas, particularly larger 

ones or those subjected to trauma.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the conversation history, the final decision is aligned with 

interpretation (C) hemorrhage (red arrow) as argued by Agent 3 (Surgeon) in Round 1, Turns 1 

and 3, and Agent 4 (Oncologist) in Round 1, Turn 2. This conclusion is supported by the gross 

pathological features consistent with hemorrhage rather than fibrosis, despite the reasoned 

opinions for fibrosis by Agents 1 (Pathologist), 2 (Radiologist), and 5 (Endocrinologist).

: I am an oncologist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 

I believe that the image of Gross Sectioned Myelolipoma demonstrates (C) hemorrhage (red

I understand that you believe the image shows (A) fibrosis, but I disagree. I believe that the 
image shows hemorrhage because the area pointed to by the red arrow is dark red and 
appears to be surrounded by a thin rim of white tissue. This is consistent with the appearance 
of hemorrhage, not fibrosis.

I am also aware that you are a specialist in the study and diagnosis of disease through 
examination of tissue samples, but I believe that my expertise in oncology gives me a unique 
perspective on this image.

I believe that my argument is strong and that I can convince the pathologist of my opinion. I

Step 3. Information Gathering and Report Generation 

Neurologist (Lead) → Ophthalmologist, Speech Therapist

: Based on the symptoms presented, which include jaw claudication 

(claud_mâchoire), double vision (diplopie), speech disorder (dysarthrie), difficulty 

swallowing (dysphagie), muscle weakness (faiblesse_msmi), eyelid dropping 

(ptose), and unusual fatigue (fatigabilité_msk), the most likely diagnosis appears 

to be (A) Myasthenia Gravis (Myasthénie grave).

For further investigations:

1. Ophthalmologist: Since double vision and eyelid drooping are some of the 

common symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis, the ophthalmologist may conduct a 

comprehensive eye examination. This might include testing for alterations in eye 

movement and eyelid strength.

2. Speech therapist: Given the occurrence of dysarthria (speech disorder) and 

dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), a Speech therapist may be involved to 

evaluate the patient's speech and swallowing abilities. They may conduct a 

detailed evaluation which includes observations of strength and coordination of 

speech muscles, assessment of speech clarity, and swallowing test to confirm the 

diagnosis.

Step 1. Complexity Check

High

The query is classified as high complexity due to the 

diverse and severe neurological symptoms like 

double vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, 

which suggest multiple underlying conditions. This 

complexity necessitates collaboration among 

multiple specialists, including neurologists and 

pulmonologists, to accurately diagnose and treat the 

patient, involving extensive differential diagnosis 

and integrated clinical decision-making.

Step 4. Final Decision

Moderator

: Based on the provided patient information and clinical evidence, the most likely diagnosis is (A) Myasthenia Gravis (Myasthénie grave). 

The symptoms such as fatigue, weakness in the muscles, difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), difficulty in speaking (dysarthrie), double 

vision (diplopie), and drooping of one or both eyelids (ptose) are all indicative of Myasthenia Gravis.

Ophthalmologist

: As an ophthalmologist on the Initial Assessment Team, I focused my 

investigation on the ocular symptoms presented by the patient, 

particularly diplopia and ptosis, both indicative of Myasthenia Gravis 

(MG).

(…)

The key findings were as follows:

1. Ptosis: Both eyes exhibited a noticeable droop, more pronounced in 

the upward gaze, indicating lid lag typical of MG.

2. Diplopia: The patient reported double vision, particularly in lateral and 

upward gaze. Change in diplopia with different gaze directions is 

consistent with MG.

Therefore, based on my assessment, the collective ocular symptoms of 

ptosis and diplopia are highly suggestive of Myasthenia Gravis.

Speech Therapist

: As a speech-language pathologist in an Initial Assessment Team (IAT) tackling the 

case of a potential Myasthenia Gravis patient, my role incorporates evaluating the 

degree and severities of the dysarthria and dysphagia symptoms.

In this context, the dysarthria will present as disrupted speech fluency, characterized 

by difficulty articulating words. As for dysphagia, this entails troubles in swallowing. 

These symptoms surface as Myasthenia Gravis cause weakness in the patient's 

skeletal muscles, which are the muscles necessary for speech and swallowing 

mechanics.

(…)

The findings from these investigations will not only support the Myasthenia Gravis 

diagnosis, they will also provide foundational data for the creation of a targeted 

rehabilitation plan. The plan will aim to maintain oral intake while ensuring safety, 

preventing any potential complications like aspiration pneumonia.

Team 1. Initial Assessment Team (IAT)

Senior Consultant (Lead) → Clinical Care Coordinator, Patient Advocate

: Given the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is (A) Myasthenia 

Gravis, a neuromuscular disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue. 

However, it's important to conduct an in-depth investigation with our team of 

clinicians.

1. Clinical Care Coordinator: This individual should help coordinate necessary 

medical tests to confirm this diagnosis. Tests may include blood tests to check for 

antibodies contributing to muscle weakness, nerve conduction studies, or an 

edrophonium test. Additionally, they will also organize appropriate care resources 

and ensure effective communications across the team.

2. Patient Advocate: As an advocate, this team member needs to communicate 

between the patient and the medical team. They need to ensure that the patient 

understands the potential diagnosis, the implications, and the subsequent steps in 

the investigative process and treatment. Their goal is to offer emotional support 

and make sure the patient's concerns or questions are accurately conveyed to 

and addressed by the medical team.

Clinical Care Coordinator

: My expertise as a clinical care coordinator involves bringing together 

different healthcare teams, managing resources and information to ensure 

the best care for our patients. It involves organizing and streamlining the 

treatment process, making sure that the care provided is efficient and 

comprehensive.

(…)

Hypothesized Diagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis 

Recommended Investigations:

1. Blood tests to look for specific antibodies present in Myasthenia Gravis.

2. Nerve conduction studies to test the nerves' ability to send signals.

3. Edrophonium test, where the drug edrophonium, which briefly relieves 

weakness in people with myasthenia gravis, is used.

Patient Advocate

: As a Patient Advocate, I understand that while the diagnosis may be medically 

accurate, it's key to clarify what this means for the patient's day-to-day life:

1. Communication: I spoke to the patient and their family about the potential 

diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis, explaining the nature of the condition, common 

symptoms, and potential treatment options. I also emphasized that further tests are 

needed before confirming the diagnosis.

2. Understand patient's fears and concerns: The patient expressed worries about the 

impacts of the disease on their daily life and potential side effects of medication. 

They are particularly concerned about the potential for extreme muscle weakness 

and how this might disrupt their current job and responsibilities.

3. Support: I assured the patient that our multidisciplinary team is dedicated to 

providing the best care for them and that we are open to discussing any concerns 

they have regarding their condition.

Medical Complexity Comparison with Human Physicians

The core premise of our MDAgent framework is its ability to adapt to the complexity of medical tasks.
To validate this approach and gain insights into how LLMs perceive medical complexity compared to
human experts, we conducted an annotation study. This study aimed to explore the alignment between
LLMs and physicians in assessing medical question complexity, a critical factor in the effectiveness
of our MDAgent framework.

Study Design
We selected 50 representative questions from the MedQA dataset, ensuring a balanced
representation across USMLE steps 1, 2, and 3. This selection process aimed to cover a wide range of
medical topics and complexity levels, mirroring the diverse challenges that our MDAgent framework
is designed to address.

Three physicians participated in our study: two with two years of Internal Medicine training (Post
Graduate Year 2, PGY-2) and one general physician. This composition allowed us to capture a range

34


---Page Break---
of clinical perspectives. The physicians rated each question on a scale of -1 (low complexity), 0
(moderate complexity), and 1 (high complexity).

Inter-rater Reliability
To quantify the agreement among our physician raters, we employed
Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). ICC is a widely used statistical measure in medical research
for assessing the consistency of ratings among multiple raters. We specifically chose two ICC
variants:

• ICC2k (Two-way random effects, average measures): 0.269 [-0.14, 0.55]

• ICC3k (Two-way mixed effects, average measures): 0.280 [-0.15, 0.57]

ICC2k was selected because it assumes our raters are randomly selected from a larger population of
similar raters, allowing for generalization of our findings. ICC3k, on the other hand, treats the raters
as fixed, focusing on the consistency among our specific set of physicians.

Both ICC values indicate moderate agreement among the raters. This level of agreement reflects
the inherent complexity and subjectivity in evaluating medical questions, even among trained pro-
fessionals. It also highlights the challenging nature of the task our MDAgent framework aims to
address.

Annotation Interface
To facilitate the annotation process for both physicians and LLMs, we
developed a specialized interface. This interface was designed to present medical questions in a clear
and consistent manner, allowing for efficient and standardized complexity ratings. Figure 13 shows a
screenshot of the annotation interface used in our study.

Figure 13: Annotation interface used for medical complexity assessment. The latest version can be
found at https://dxagents.github.io/2024/05/01/medqa.html.

LLM Annotations and Comparison
To compare LLM performance with human expert judgments,
we employed several state-of-the-art models to annotate the same set of questions. We then compared
these assessments with the majority opinion of the physicians, determined by the mode of their ratings
(or the mean in cases of complete disagreement).

Table 13 presents the Pearson correlation between each LLM’s complexity ratings and the physicians’
majority opinions:

Table 13: Correlation between LLM complexity ratings and physician majority opinions

The results of our study provide valuable insights into the current state of LLM capabilities in medical
complexity assessment and underscore the importance of our MDAgent framework:

1. Subjectivity in medical complexity: The moderate ICC values among physicians highlight
the inherent subjectivity in assessing medical question complexity. This finding validates
our approach in MDAgent, which doesn’t rely on a single, fixed assessment of complexity
but rather adapts its collaboration structure dynamically.
2. Current LLM limitations: The low correlations between LLM and human assessments
indicate that current LLMs may not fully capture the nuances that human experts consider
when evaluating medical complexity. This observation reinforces the need for our MDAgent
framework, which can compensate for individual LLM limitations through collaborative
decision-making.
3. Potential for improvement: The variation in correlation across different LLM models
(from -0.090 to 0.110) suggests there is room for improvement in LLM performance. This
aligns with our MDAgent approach, which can leverage the strengths of multiple models
and adapt to future improvements in LLM capabilities.
4. Value of human expertise: The discrepancy between LLM and physician assessments un-
derscores the continued importance of human medical expertise. Our MDAgent framework
acknowledges this by incorporating human-like collaboration strategies and the potential for
human oversight in critical decisions.
5. Adaptability of MDAgent: The challenges revealed in this study highlight the wisdom of
our MDAgent’s adaptive approach. By dynamically adjusting its collaboration structure
based on perceived task complexity, MDAgent can mitigate the limitations of individual
LLMs and approach the nuanced understanding demonstrated by human experts.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and introduction state the primary contributions of the paper,
including the introduction of the MDAgents framework, its adaptive decision-making
structure, and the significant performance improvements demonstrated through experimental
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper includes a section on limitations, discussing the scope of the
framework, and areas for future improvement.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

37


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results that require assumptions or
proofs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides comprehensive details on datasets, experimental setups,
and methodologies used, ensuring that the results can be reproduced accurately.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper includes a link to the code repository and provides sufficient
instructions in the supplemental material to reproduce the experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper specifies all relevant experimental details, including data splits,
number of samples, and number of seeds, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper reports error bars and includes information on the statistical sig-
nificance of the experimental results, ensuring a clear understanding of the variability and
reliability of the findings.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

39


---Page Break---
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The experiments primarily involved inference using API calls to GPT-3.5,
GPT-4 (V), and Gemini-Pro (Vision). The type of compute workers, memory, and time
of execution are managed by the API providers (OpenAI and Gemini). Details about the
number of API calls and the specific configurations used for each experiment are provided,
ensuring reproducibility.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, ensuring responsible
conduct throughout the study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

40


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses potential societal impacts, both positive and negative,
including the improvement of medical decision-making and the risks associated with misuse
or biases in the AI system.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discusses potential limitations, including the risks of medical
hallucinations and false knowledge. It includes guidelines within the main text to ensure
responsible use of the MDAgents framework and publicly available datasets, emphasizing
ethical usage and adherence to best practices.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper properly credits the creators of existing assets used and clearly states
the licenses and terms of use.

41


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not introduce any new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]

42


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
