Abstract

Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to new tasks through fine-tuning has
been made more efficient by the introduction of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA. However, these methods often underperform
compared to full fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios involving complex datasets.
This issue becomes even more pronounced in complex domains, highlighting the
need for improved PEFT approaches that can achieve better performance. Through
a series of experiments, we have uncovered two critical insights that shed light
on the training and parameter inefficiency of LoRA. Building on these insights,
we have developed HydraLoRA, a LoRA framework with an asymmetric structure
that eliminates the need for domain expertise. Our experiments demonstrate that
HydraLoRA outperforms other PEFT approaches, even those that rely on domain
knowledge during the training and inference phases. Code is available.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs; [10, 3, 36, 47, 48, 32, 33]) are notably powerful, yet their training
involves substantial expense. Adapting a single LLM for multiple downstream applications via fine-
tuning has emerged as a prevalent method to cater to specific domain needs, balancing performance
with practicality. This approach, however, faces a significant challenge due to the extensive memory
and computational resources required for full fine-tuning (FFT), i.e., fine-tuning all billions of
parameters. A solution to this has been the development of more selective adaptation techniques,
involving modifying only a portion of the parameters or integrating external modules designed for
new tasks. Key methodologies in this sphere include LoRA [18], Adaptors [37, 17, 31], and many
other variants [25, 24, 9, 14, 53], all part of what can be generally termed as Parameter-Efficient
Fine-tuning (PEFT). PEFT strategies are characterized by freezing the backbone model parameters
while only a minimal number of task-specific parameters are introduced and fine-tuned. This method
substantially boosts efficiency in the phases of fine-tuning and subsequent deployment, marking a
significant advancement in the practical use of LLMs.

While fine-tuning a small subset of parameters offers a streamlined approach for domain adaptation,
it’s well-recognized that model performance is closely tied to the number of parameters involved [22].
This intrinsic characteristic of methods like LoRA often results in them falling short of the FFT
baseline, which updates all parameters, thereby creating a trade-off between efficiency and model
quality. This issue of compromised quality in a low-parameter setting becomes even more pronounced
in target domains characterized by complex sub-domains and diverse tasks. This situation presents a
compelling research question:

are shown in this Figure. (a) LoRA architecture with matrix A to achieve low rank and matrix B to
recover. (b) under the same parameter count, a monolithic LoRA is split into multiple smaller A and

What is the optimal architecture that can deliver superior model performance while still capitalizing
on the efficiency benefits of a reduced parameter footprint?

In our research, we carry out a series of exploratory experiments, applying LoRA to the LLaMA2 [48]
model to adapt it to a new domain encompassing multiple downstream tasks. As shown in Figure 1(a),
LoRA adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices A and B in addition to existing weight
matrices. Our in-depth analysis of LoRA’s mechanics yields several insightful observations and
leads to the formulation of key hypotheses. First, rather than employing a single LoRA for the
entire domain, it proves more effective to deploy multiple, smaller LoRA heads, each dedicated to
a specific downstream task (see Figure 1(b)). This suggests that domain or task interference might
harmfully impact the training process. We further hypothesize that this interference originates from
“intrinsic components”—sub-domains or distinct tasks—potentially unknown even to domain experts.
Additionally, upon visualizing the parameters of LoRA, we discern a pattern: some parameters
predominantly learn the commonalities across all data, while others focus on the unique aspects of
each intrinsic component. From these observations, we posit that an optimal LoRA architecture
should embody an explicit, asymmetric structure.

Building upon the observations, we propose an improved end-to-end LoRA framework, which
we refer to as HydraLoRA. From the architecture perspective, unlike LoRA’s symmetric structure,
HydraLoRA has an asymmetric structure that has a shared A matrix and multiple B matrices (see
Figure 1(c)). The shared A matrix is used by all samples for parameter efficiency. During the
fine-tuning phase, HydraLoRA is designed to auto-identify “intrinsic components” and segregate
training samples into distinct B matrices. During the inference phase, HydraLoRA leverages multiple
B matrices using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE; [20, 40]) manner. Unlike prior work, HydraLoRA
completely eliminates the need for human expertise and assumptions, showing better performance
than using domain knowledge to guide the fine-tuning process.

Background and Motivation

2.1
LoRA Basics

LoRA [18] achieves comparable performances to fine-tuning on many benchmarks by freezing the
pre-trained model weights W0 and inserting trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of
the pre-trained model. In particular, for each layer, LoRA uses two sequential low-rank matrices A
and B to fit the residual weights for adaptation. The forward computation is written as follows:

y′ = y + ∆y = W0x + BAx
(1)

where y ∈R d is the output and the x ∈R k denotes the input. B ∈R d×r, A ∈R r×k with
r ≪min(d, k). Normally matrix B is initialized with zeroes and matrix A is initialized with
Kaiming Uniform [15] to force ∆y = 0 at the beginning.

LoRA’s Practical Dilemma

Parameter count has a clear impact on the performance of neural models [22, 33]. Yet, Parameter-
Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Adapter [17] and prefix-tuning [25], focus on fine-
tuning a limited set of parameters. These approaches present a practical dilemma: while restricting
the number of tuned parameters is essential for training efficiency, it hinders the model’s ability to
learn from diverse datasets. This trade-off becomes particularly evident when considering corpus
heterogeneity [2]. Figure 2 reveals a notable performance disparity between PEFT techniques and
full fine-tuning (FFT), with the gap widening in scenarios involving a more diverse or heterogeneous
training corpus.

Heterogeneity signifies the diversity within the dataset,
often leading to interference due to its varied content and
style [2]. Parameter-efficient approaches are particularly
sensitive, suffering greater performance losses in hetero-

Observations

In this work, we aim for a PEFT approach that strikes a better balance between maximizing the
learning capability for heterogeneous data and minimizing the number of parameters involved. A
key goal is to ensure that our enhanced technique exhibits robust generalization across unseen tasks,
independent of any prior task-specific knowledge. To achieve our objectives, we focus on LoRA and
conduct a series of experiments as Table 1 to gain a deeper understanding of its mechanisms. Our
methodology involves leveraging data from diverse tasks within a domain, and training distinct LoRA
heads for each domain, leading to our first observation:

Observation I: With the same parameter count, rather than employing a single LoRA for the entire
domain dataset, it proves more effective to deploy multiple, smaller LoRA heads, each dedicated to a
specific downstream task.

This suggests that interference among tasks might harmfully impact the training process. Furthermore,
we posit that this interference is NOT exclusive to this explicit multi-task training. This interference
could happen in any training setting since all datasets inherently consist of multiple implicit intrinsic
components, such as sub-domains or tasks within a domain that is even unknown to domain experts.
To better understand how multiple LoRA heads mitigate the interference among intrinsic components,
in Figure 3, we employ the t-SNE technique [49] to visualize the parameters of matrix A and B across
all heads. This analysis yields another critical observation:

Observation II: When multiple LoRA heads are trained individually on different data, the parameters
of matrix A from different heads tend to converge, while those of matrix B are distinguishable.

In detail, the parameters of matrix A across all heads exhibit a high degree of similarity, leading to
their overlaps in the figure. Conversely, the parameters of matrix B from different heads are distinct
and easily distinguishable. We posit that this divergence is an artifact of the initialization schemes,
with matrix A inclined toward capturing commonalities across domains, while matrix B adapts to
domain-specific diversities. The distinction between matrix A and B offers valuable insights for
enhancing both parameter efficiency and effectiveness. From an efficiency standpoint, our hypothesis
suggests that the parameters of matrix A could potentially be shared across multiple heads, thereby
reducing redundancy. Regarding effectiveness, since the parameters of matrix B of different heads

three subtasks of Dolly-15K including “summarization (Sum)”, “closed QA (QA)” and “information extraction

to 32 adaptive modules. Each module consists of {0: q_proj of A, 1: q_proj of B, 2: v_proj of A, 3: v_proj of B}
submodules. This makes a total of 32 × 4 submodules. Left displays all submodules. Center shows all even

differences in the fine-tuned LoRA modules for different tasks arise mainly from the B matrix.

are dispersed, suggesting that using a single head to adapt to multiple domains might be less effective
than using individual heads for each domain, which minimizes the interference between domains.

Building upon our observations, we propose an optimized LoRA architecture designed to enhance
cost-effectiveness. In this architecture, we share the parameters of A matrix across various sub-
domains or tasks to improve parameter efficiency, while deploying multiple B matrices, each tailored
to handle different intrinsic components. This design allows for a more effective adaptation to
the specific characteristics of each component. While these intrinsic components can be manually
identified using prior knowledge of the training data, we also introduce end-to-end methods using
Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) [21], which will be detailed in the methodology section. This automatic
approach facilitates flexibility and applicability, particularly in scenarios where prior knowledge is
limited or unavailable.

HydraLoRA

In this section, we introduce the proposed HydraLoRA, an asymmetric LoRA architecture for efficient
fine-tuning, as illustrated in Figure 1. After that, we show the workflow of HydraLoRA as Figure 4.

3.1
Asymmetric LoRA architecture

The LoRA method updates two low-rank matrices A and B, and uses AB as the change of a pretrained
and frozen weight W0 of a linear layer as shown in Eq. 1. The integral parameters are fine-tuned for
the whole corpus in the original LoRA, which causes difficulty in learning the various knowledge
aspects. Drawing from a detailed breakdown analysis of LoRA, a potential solution is to segment
the entire LoRA into “Hydra” structured LoRA variants, that is, characterized by a central shared
matrix A and several distinct matrices B, fostering a blend of shared knowledge and specialized
functionalities. As Figure 1, HydraLoRA is to fine-tune LoRAs to achieve robust performance without
redundancy, thereby benefiting the entire heterogeneous corpus. The asymmetric LoRA architecture
can be formulated as:

W = W0 + ∆W

= W0 +

N
X

i=1
ωi · BiA

The matrics Bi ∈Rd×r and shared A ∈Rr×k. The hyper-parameter N denotes the number of B
matrices. The term ωi modulates these contribution weights for head Bi.

task relevance through the application of k-means or developer-specified size. Subsequently, we
propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that handles B matrices as expert adapters to ensure
computational efficiency throughout the fine-tuning (Section 3.2.1) and inference (Section 3.2.2)
stages by freezing the rest of the LLM parameters. During inference, it flexibly and dynamically
merges multiple B matrices through the MoE router.

3.2.1
Fine-tuning

Motivated by Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs; [20, 40]), where experts are selectively activated by a gating
mechanism (Router) in response to different inputs. In HydraLoRA, we substitute each expert with a
lightweight LoRA adapter. During fine-tuning, while weights of LLMs remain frozen, the experts and
router layers are trained from scratch. In order to achieve a unified approach to the distinct forward
processes of multiple B matrices, we define a set of experts, denoted as (E1, . . . , EN), to learn the
updated matrix ∆W. As HydraLoRA fine-tunes the experts using the heterogeneous corpus, the
shared matrix A inherently captures collaborative knowledge to augment intra-gains, and different
matrices B foster knowledge modularity to mitigate fine-tuning inter-offsets. Based on this structure,
the forward process of HydraLoRA is expressed as:

y = W0x +

N
X

i=1
ωiEiAx
(MoE)
(3)

where N denotes the number of experts, i.e., B matrices.To regulate these contributions, we introduce
a gate function (router network) commonly consisting of a dense layer with trainable weights
(transformation matrix) Wg ∈Rr×N followed by a softmax function which takes an intermediate
token representation x as input and combines the output of each expert based on the gating scores
(ω1, . . . , ωN):

ωi = softmax(W T
g x)
(Router)
(4)

3.2.2
Inference

During inference, HydraLoRA merges adapters by enabling routing computation based on the input.
Specifically, since matrices B operate as linear functions, we initially compute a weighted average
of the experts. Following this, we apply a PEFT transformation using the combined expertise. The
HydraLoRA significantly enhances training efficiency through an extremely parameter-efficient MoE
formulation. Additionally, the intrinsic structural modularity of HydraLoRA facilitates rapid recovery
and merging of the trained parameters during inference, leading to substantial memory savings.

Experiments

In this section, we detail the principal experiments. We begin with an overview of the experimental
setup and implementation intricacies. Following this, we share our findings and offer a succinct
interpretation.

4.1
Experiment Setting

Dataset and Benchmarks
To explore the properties and commonalities of the LoRA asymmetric
structure, we conduct experiments on both single and multiple domains to evaluate the effectiveness
of HydraLoRA for profiling intrinsic components. • Single domain. 1) General: we fine-tune with
the general instruction tuning databricks-dolly-15k [8] for generic language capability and evaluate
with MMLU [16]. 2) Medical: we fine-tune with GenMedGPT and clinic-10k from ChatDoctor [26]
for medicine applications and evaluate medical tasks in MMLU. 3) Law: we fine-tune with two legal
instruction tuning datasets Lawyer-Instruct [1] and US-Terms [4] then evaluate with law tasks in
MMLU. 4) Math: we fine-tune with the training split of GSM8K [7] for mathematical reasoning and
evaluate with test set of GSM8K. 5) Code: we fine-tune with CodeAlpaca [5] for code generation and
evaluate with HumanEval [6]. • Multi-task domain. We select a portion of the Flanv2 [51] datasets
covering Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), which
can be grouped into 10 distinct task clusters. Then we evaluate it with the Big-Bench Hard (BBH)
[45] benchmark. A detailed description of the benchmarks can be found in Appendix A.1.

Baselines
• First, we compare HydraLoRA with different PEFT methods on single datasets: 1)
Full fine-tuning; 2) Prompt Tuning [24]; 3) P-Tuning [29]; 4) Prefix Tuning [25]; 5) IA3 [27]; 6)
AdaLoRA [55]. • Second, we extend the experiments exploring HydraLoRA on multiple datasets
compared with more weighted average methods: 1) Lorahub [19] employs black-box optimization
to learn weights of 20 randomly selected LoRAs for new tasks, using weighted averaging without
needing gradient calculations. 2) LoRA MoE [52] combines lightweight experts (LoRA) with MoE
architecture for high efficiency, generalizing to new tasks without prior knowledge. A detailed
description of the baseline models can be found in Appendix A.2.

4.2
Overall Performance

The experimental results of HydraLoRA and the competing baselines are presented in Table 2 with a
single domain and Table 3 with the mixed task domain. The evaluation of diverse tasks demonstrates
that HydraLoRA consistently outperforms all other schemes. The performances rooted in LoRA
outperform those of conventional PEFT methodologies. Compared to the default single LoRA
configuration (rank=8), the Hydra architecture, enriched by the integration of several B matrices,
effectively addresses the inherent conflicts among intrinsic components of the corpus. Furthermore,
with equivalent parameters (rank=16), the model shows superior performance, confirming the ef-

fectiveness of the adopted parameters. Based on Table 2 and Table 3, we propose three research
questions that confirm the aforementioned observations.

RQ1: Is it more effective to use multiple smaller LoRA heads for specific tasks rather than one
single LoRA for the entire domain dataset, given the same parameter count?
Comparing the
high-dimensional LoRA configuration with r = 32 against a segmented version using LoRA-Split, a
variant introduced by HydraLoRA, which divides the model into four distinct components each with
r = 8. That is, multiple vanilla LoRAs are directly utilized to capture the differences between data.
We observe a noteworthy trend in the performance across a variety of tasks as detailed in Table 2. It
illustrates the superior performance of LoRA-Split in comparison to the traditional LoRA approach,
across all the evaluated scenarios. This enhancement in performance is a strong indication of the
detrimental impact that task interference can have on the training process. By segregating the tasks
into discrete components, LoRA-Split effectively minimizes the conflict and interference between
tasks, thereby promoting a more efficient and focused environment.

The concept of LoRA-Split hinges on the construction of different intrinsic component compositions,
employing LoRA as a foundational technique to strategically mitigate the interference conflict. This
architectural innovation has proven to be a pivotal factor in enhancing model performance. However,
it’s important to note that while LoRA-Split marks a significant advancement in model efficiency and
task handling, it also introduces a certain level of parameter redundancy. The segmented approach of
LoRA-Split inevitably leads to an increase in the overall model parameters, which can be manifold in
comparison to the traditional, singular LoRA model. This increase in parameters, while contributing
to the model’s robustness and capability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, also poses new
challenges in terms of computational resources and model optimization.

RQ2: Will multiple LoRA heads, individually trained on different data, improve efficiency by
distinguishing matrix B parameters?
We evaluated the Hydra structure LoRA — HydraLoRA
that is characterized by a shared LoRA A matrix, while maintaining distinct B matrices that are
trained separately. This configuration was meticulously compared with both the standard LoRA and
the LoRA-Split approaches, emphasizing efficiency parameters.

According to the results presented in Table 2, unlike split which straightforwardly adopts multiple
vanilla LoRAs, HydraLoRA adopts an asymmetric LoRA structure that not only improves parameter
efficiency by separating the uses of A matrix for commonalities and B matrices for diversities with a
notably smaller adapter parameter set, but also employs a trainable router to improve the composition
of multiple B matrices that outperforms the LoRA-Split approach. This finding is significant as it
suggests that HydraLoRA not only enhances performance efficiency but also boosts overall system
effectiveness. This may be driven by 1) different B matrices capturing different features of the
data-intrinsic knowledge, mitigating mutual interferences, and avoiding performance offsets. 2)
Module A maintains the collaborative knowledge by taking the strengths of each and integrating
them to improve the model performance.

RQ3: How does HydraLoRA fare against other merge methods in complex, multi-task domains,
considering scalability and robustness?
While we hypothesize that the asymmetry is mainly
rooted in the different initialization methods of A and B matrices, it is possible that this behavior varies
on different model architectures and datasets. Recent work confirms similar empirical observations
[54, 13]. To the best of our ability, we extended the experiments exploring HydraLoRA on multiple

datasets. LoRA MoE and their variants typically aim at tackling multi-tasks by employing multiple
independent LoRAs. This makes them suitable for handling various domains. However, for a single
dataset like ours, a “default” MoE method might not be optimal. HydraLoRA addresses this by
constructing asymmetric structures and utilizing multiple B matrices to capture the specific nuances
within the single dataset. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the experimental
results in Table 3.

4.3
Energy and Throughput Analysis

RQ4: How does the “Hydra” structure in HydraLoRA enhance system efficiency, particularly
in reducing training energy consumption and latency?
We evaluate the system efficiency of
HydraLoRA from two perspectives: training energy consumption and latency. The following experi-
ments were executed on a GPU infrastructure consisting of 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs and a CPU powered
by an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU clocked at 2.00GHz. Power consumption measurements
were recorded using CodeCarbon [34]. Figure 5 shows the results of various fine-tuning approaches
for GSM-8K using the LLaMA2-7B model. we can see that HydraLoRA effectively speeds up the
training process 1.96× and reduces 49.6% energy cost compared to LoRA (rank=32). While the
energy consumption and latency of LoRA-Split exceeds the LoRA (rank=32). This is for the reason
that HydraLoRA jointly considers inherent knowledge modularity and collaboration, which utilizes
the “Hydra” structure with a shared A matrix and different B matrix. In this way, it only employs
rank=16 training overhead but expands to a performance enhancement of more than rank=32. Overall,
this experiment demonstrates the parameter effectiveness of HydraLoRA.

Ablation Study

RQ6: What impact do the MoE architecture and the gate function have on the fine-tuning
process?
To delve deeper into understanding the contributions of each component in HydraLoRA.
we present the results of our ablation study in Figure 6. The variant w/o MoE (essentially reverts to
LoRA) excludes the MoE architecture. Similarly, the w/o gate variant employs uniform expert weights
bypassing the gate function. The w/o hydra adopts multiple vanilla LoRAs in a straightforward way.
Figure 6 indicates that the full HydraLoRA model outperforms its variants, showing that both the MoE
architecture and gate function significantly contribute to its effectiveness across various language
understanding domains.

Hyper-parameter Analysis

RQ7: How do the number of intrinsic component of HydraLoRA influence performance out-
comes?
As Figure 8 shown, we conduct a comprehensive and meticulous analysis by fine-tuning
the Dolly-15K model on the LLaMA2-7B dataset and subsequently evaluating its performance on
the MMLU benchmark to rigorously examine the impact of variations in the intrinsic component,
symbolized by the variable N, on the model’s overall performance. Empirically we find that the
number N of clusters is not a sensitive parameter for HydraLoRA, with a wide range of reasonable
number N of clusters (e.g. 2 to 4) performing decently well in all settings in our experiments. Specifi-
cally, the performance loss of N = 3 vs. the optimal N = 4 is only 0.42%. Meanwhile, as illustrated
in Figure 7, we employ three distinct methods to generate the number of corpus clusters 15-fold,
and the results demonstrate that the k-means [30] yields comparable outcomes with DBSCAN [39].
Therefore, based on this observation, we choose k-means because it is simple but effective, more
sophisticated hyperparameter search approaches (e.g. DBSCAN, parameter sweep and Bayesian
optimization) will be unnecessarily costly. It’s noteworthy that HydraLoRA is adeptly designed
to orchestrate its components in a way that it can automatically calibrate and navigate toward the
optimal performance configuration across various parameters. This intelligent auto-tuning is achieved
through the application of the k-means clustering algorithm. This strategic component orchestration
not only enhances performance but also ensures a more efficient and effective utilization of resources,
underpinning the model’s capability to adapt and perform efficiently in a dynamic computational
environment.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning
LLMs are becoming increasingly powerful, but fine-tuning
them often requires significant computational resources. This has spurred research on parameter-
efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that reduce memory and storage costs during adaptation.
One prominent PEFT approach is adapters [17, 37]. It introduces new, trainable dense layers within
the existing model, keeping the original parameters frozen. This concept has proven successful
across various domains [35, 42, 43, 56]. Further improvements on adapter compactness involve
constructing parameter matrices using Kronecker products of low-rank matrices [31]. Another
PEFT strategy directly manipulates activations with learned vectors. This can be achieved through
concatenation [29, 25, 24], multiplication (IA3; [27]), or addition (BitFit; [53]). Prefix-tuning [25] and
prompt-tuning [24] are noteworthy examples that fine-tune continuous prompts instead of designing
discrete ones [9]. Interestingly, a study suggests that many PEFT methods can be viewed as a form
of adapter, providing a unified perspective [14]. Beyond adding new parameters or altering the
computational graph, researchers also explore sparse [12, 44, 46] or low-rank updates (LoRA; [18]).

Multi-LoRA Architecture
LoRA has notably garnered increasing interest recently, becoming
a standard approach for adapting LLMs such as LLaMA [47, 48] under limited computational
resources. Recognizing its potential, researchers have delved deeper, exploring the benefits of
employing multiple LoRAs. LoraHub [19] takes this multi-LoRA approach by training several
adapters and strategically picking combinations based on the domain during inference. Meanwhile,
MultiLoRA [50] focuses on horizontal scaling, aiming to reduce LoRA’s parameter dependence.
This involves splitting LoRA modules along the rank dimension and introducing learnable scaling
factors for enhanced expressiveness. Addressing scaling challenges from a different angle, the
mixture of LoRA concept is further proposed [52]. This mitigates resource consumption when

scaling instruction-tuned LLMs. Recognizing the potential for conflict during instruction tuning,
LoRAMoE [11] leverages the Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs; [20]) structure to safeguard the pre-
trained LLM’s knowledge from excessive corruption by instruction data. Similarly, MOELoRA [28]
incorporates a MoE framework into LLMs, thereby improving their multitasking capabilities in the
medical domain. Shifting the focus to the system perspective, S-LoRA [41] provides a framework
for efficiently serving multiple LoRA adapters. Unlike previous methods that relied on choosing
LoRA combinations based on their training domains, HydraLoRA breaks free from the dependence
on domain knowledge during inference. Additionally, HydraLoRA’s asymmetric structure further
enhances parameter efficiency compared to existing symmetric approaches.

Conclusion

In this work, we start by conducting exploratory experiments applying the LoRA technique to
LLaMA2, aiming to adapt it to a new domain across various tasks. This study unveils the limitations
of employing a single LoRA for the entire domain, highlighting the detrimental effects of domain
interference. In response, we introduce a novel architecture HydraLoRA that features an asymmetric
structure with a shared matrix for all samples and distinct matrices for each intrinsic component. This
design improves domain adaptation by selectively focusing on distinct components, enhancing both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of balancing learning
capabilities for diverse datasets against the need for a lean model, offering a viable pathway for
improving LLMs with minimal parameter growth. More discussion about limitation and broader
impacts are available in Appendix D and E.

Datasets and Baselines

A.1
Datasets

Single Domain

1. General: we fine-tune with the general instruction tuning databricks-dolly-15k for generic
language capability and evaluate with MMLU.
2. Medical: we fine-tune with GenMedGPT and clinic-10k from ChatDoctor for medicine
applications and evaluate medical tasks in MMLU including three related tasks: “clinical

evaluate with test set of GSM8K.
5. Code: we fine-tune with CodeAlpaca for code generation and evaluate with HumanEval.

Multi-task Domain
As well for complex mixed multi-task/domain, we select a portion of the
Flanv2 datasets covering Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation
(NLG), which can be grouped into 10 distinct task clusters. Then we evaluate it with the Big-Bench
Hard (BBH) benchmark.

We summarize the details of the used datasets as follows:

1. Struct-to-Text Conversion: This task evaluates the capability to generate natural language
descriptions from structured data inputs. We use the following datasets: (1) CommonGen;
(2) DART; (3) E2ENLG; (4) WebNLG;
2. Translation: Translation involves converting text from one language to another, maintaining
the original meaning and nuances. We use the following datasets: (1) En-Fr from WMT’14;
EnDe, En-Tr, En-Ru, En-Fi, En-Ro from WMT’16; (3) En-Es from Paracrawl.
3. Commonsense Reasoning: This involves assessing the ability to apply physical or scientific
principles alongside common sense in reasoning tasks. We use the following datasets: (1)
COPA, (2) HellaSwag, (3) PiQA, and (4) StoryCloze.
4. Sentiment Analysis: A fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that deter-
mines the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) of a given text. We use the following
datasets: (1) IMDB, (2) Sentiment140, (3) SST-2, and (4) Yelp. information sources. We
use the following datasets: (1) ARC, (2) NQ, and (3) TriviaQA.
5. Paraphrase Detection: This task requires models to ascertain whether two sentences convey
the same meaning, indicating semantic equivalence. We use the following datasets: (1)
MRPC, (2) QQP, and (3) Paws Wiki.
6. Coreference Resolution: Involves identifying instances within a text that refer to the same
entity, demonstrating an understanding of textual context. We use the following datasets: (1)
DPR and (2) WSC273.
7. Reading comprehension: Assesses the capability to derive answers to questions from a
provided text containing relevant information. We use the following datasets: (1) BoolQ, (2)
DROP, (3) MultiRC, (4) OBQA, (5) SQuADv1, (6) SQuADv2.
8. Reading Comprehension with Commonsense: Merges traditional reading comprehension
skills with commonsense reasoning, requiring understanding beyond the explicit text. We
use the following datasets: (1) CosmosQA; (2) ReCoRD.
9. Natural Language Inference: Focuses on deducing the relationship between two sentences,
determining if the second sentence logically follows from, contradicts, or is unrelated to the
first sentence. We use the following datasets: (1) ANLI, (2) CB; (3) MNLI; (4) QNLI; (5)
SNLI; (6) WNLI; (7) RTE.
10. Closed-Book Question Answering: This task challenges models to answer questions about
general knowledge without direct access to external

PEFT methods

1. Full Fine-tuning is the default strategy for adaptation. During fine-tuning, the model is
initialized with pretrained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient
updates.

2. Prompt Tuning adds task-specific prompts to the input, and these prompt parameters are
updated independently of the pretrained model parameters which are frozen.

3. P-Tuning adds trainable prompt embeddings to the input that is optimized by a prompt
encoder to find a better prompt, eliminating the need to manually design prompts. The
prompt tokens can be added anywhere in the input sequence, and P-Tuning also introduces
anchor tokens for improving performance.

4. Prefix Tuning prefixes a series of task-specific vectors to the input sequence that can be
learned while keeping the pretrained model frozen. The prefix parameters are inserted in all
of the model layers.

5. IA3 enhances efficiency by infusing learned vectors into transformer architectures, drasti-
cally cutting trainable parameters while preserving performance and minimizing inference
latency.

6. AdaLoRA is a method for optimizing the number of trainable parameters to assign to weight
matrices and layers, unlike LoRA, which distributes parameters evenly across all modules.
More parameters are budgeted for important weight matrices and layers while less important
ones receive fewer parameters.

Multiple LoRA weighted average methods

1. LoRA MoE. A collection of n parameterized experts, denoted as E1, ..., En, is orchestrated
by a router network R. This network features a dense layer with adjustable weights Wg
from Rdm×n. A softmax function then processes an intermediate token representation x,
yielding gating scores s1, ..., sn that determine the weighted contribution of each expert’s
output:

si = R(x)i = softmax(W T
g x)
(Router)
(5)

Subsequently, the overall output y is synthesized by aggregating the experts’ outputs, each
modulated by its respective gating score:

y =

n
X

i=1
si · Ei(x)
(MoE)
(6)

This results in a dynamic allocation of the model’s capacity, enabling specialized processing
by experts as directed by the router’s gating mechanism.

2. LoraHub aggregates 20 LoRAs at random for new downstream tasks. To master the weight
of each LoRA, it utilizes a black-box optimization technique, bypassing the need for gradient
calculations of the large model. This process involves weighted averaging at the parameter
level. Mirroring the MoE training approach, we select 20 random samples for each task,
creating a cohesive training dataset optimized through this black-box method.

B
Initialization via k-means

In the case of considering heterogeneous corpora, it is crucial to select the appropriate number N
of matrix B, to ensure consistent performance and minimize unnecessary computational overhead.
This choice is usually closely related to the training corpus. In this work, we propose initializing
HydraLoRA modules via k-means [30] algorithm for adaptive initialization. Specifically, k-means is
utilized to process the heterogeneous corpus to identify the best-fit taxonomy of the corpus, i.e., the
optimal N. First, we extract key features from the corpus by applying the Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF; [38]) algorithm and transform the textual information into numerical

feature vectors. We integrate the elbow method [23] to determine the optimal value of N. Initially,
N cluster centers are randomly selected for preliminary clustering as Eq. 7, followed by updating
the cluster centers to accurately reflect the data within each cluster as Eq. 8. where Cj is the cluster
center to which data point Xi is assigned and d(·, ·) is the Euclidean distance function. Sj is the set
of data points in the j-th cluster.

Cj = argmin

Cj =

(8)

By analyzing the relationship between the sum of squares of errors (SSE) and different N values, we
observe that SSE decreases as N increases. Identifying the elbow point on the SSE curve — where
the rate of decrease in SSE slows down — is crucial. The elbow point represents the optimal N value,
beyond which increasing the number of clusters does not significantly enhance performance, thereby
achieving an ideal balance between model complexity and performance.

Figure 9: Breakdown analysis of LoRA modules. Compare fine-tuned LoRA modules of GSM-
8K [7] with its subsets using T-SNE. We employ the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)
segmentation scheme to divide GSM8K into three subsets and fine-tune them using different LoRAs.
Consider LLaMA2-7B (random seed=42), which contains 32 decoder layers, corresponding to 32
adaptive modules. Each module consists of {0: q_proj_A, 1: q_proj_B, 2: v_proj_A, 3: v_proj_B}
submodules. This makes a total of 32 × 4 submodules. (a,b) left displays all submodules. (a,b) center
shows all even submodules, i.e. the A-matrix. (a,b) right represents all odd submodules, i.e. the
B-matrix. It can be seen that the differences in the fine-tuned LoRA modules for different tasks arise
mainly from the B matrix.

reserved for future exploration. Our current evaluation is limited to fine-tuning, while an examination
of the efficacy of these techniques during the pre-training phase remains a subject for subsequent
research. Another potential limitation stems from the training data itself. In multi-task scenarios,
extreme conditions—such as contaminated or adversarial data—can significantly impair performance
due to aggregation issues. The heterogeneity across tasks, including variations in language, task
type, and domain, may reduce the effectiveness of shared knowledge, thereby diminishing its
overall impact. This challenge is not exclusive to HydraLoRA but is common to all multi-task
frameworks. Addressing these concerns may involve implementing robustness-enhancing measures
(e.g., data sanitization, robust aggregation, and anomaly detection) and integrating privacy-preserving
technologies, such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and blockchain.

E
Broader Impacts

Positive Societal Impacts
The proposed HydraLoRA framework, with its asymmetric structure
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, has the potential to make LLMs more accessible and
efficient. This could democratize AI, enabling more researchers, developers, and organizations to
leverage the power of LLMs for various applications, ultimately driving innovation and progress.
Moreover, by effectively addressing the challenge of domain or task interference, HydraLoRA could
significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in complex, multi-task domains. This could lead to
more accurate and reliable AI-powered tools and services in areas like healthcare, education, and
finance, ultimately improving the quality of life for many people. Lastly, the parameter-efficient
approach of HydraLoRA could help reduce the computational resources required for training and
fine-tuning LLMs, thereby lessening the environmental impact of AI.

Negative Societal Impacts
As with any AI technology, there are potential negative societal impacts
to consider. The risk of misuse is a significant concern, as HydraLoRA could be used for malicious
purposes, such as creating more sophisticated and convincing deepfakes or spreading misinformation
and propaganda. Additionally, the increased efficiency and accessibility of AI brought about by
HydraLoRA could lead to job displacement in certain sectors, as AI-powered tools and services
become capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans. Lastly, the use of LLMs in various
applications could potentially lead to privacy and security issues, especially if these models are used
to process or generate sensitive information. The proposed HydraLoRA framework, while not directly
related to these issues, could inadvertently contribute to them by making it easier to deploy LLMs in
various applications.
