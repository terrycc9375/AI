Abstract

In the absence of class priors, recent deep clustering methods resort to data aug-
mentation and pseudo-labeling strategies to generate supervision signals. Though
achieved remarkable success, existing works struggle to discriminate hard samples
at cluster boundaries, mining which is particularly challenging due to their unre-
liable cluster assignments. To break such a performance bottleneck, we propose
incorporating user interaction to facilitate clustering instead of exhaustively mining
semantics from the data itself. To be exact, we present Interactive Deep Clustering
(IDC), a plug-and-play method designed to boost the performance of pre-trained
clustering models with minimal interaction overhead. More specifically, IDC first
quantitatively evaluates sample values based on hardness, representativeness, and
diversity, where the representativeness avoids selecting outliers and the diversity
prevents the selected samples from collapsing into a small number of clusters.
IDC then queries the cluster affiliations of high-value samples in a user-friendly
manner. Finally, it utilizes the user feedback to finetune the pre-trained clustering
model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDC could remarkably improve the
performance of various pre-trained clustering models, at the expense of low user
interaction costs. The code could be accessed at pengxi.me.

Introduction

Clustering aims at partitioning samples into semantically distinct groups. In recent years, deep
clustering methods [5, 30, 15, 41, 13], powered by the feature extraction ability of neural networks,
have excelled in handling large-scale and high-dimensional data across various domains, including
image segmentation [7], anomaly detection [25], medical analysis [1], bioinformatics [20], and so on.

To discover the semantical data partitions, the core of deep clustering lies in designing supervision
signals to extract discriminative information from data. To this end, early efforts reformulate the
self-representation property [31], hierarchical structure [43], or assignment distribution prior [42]
into differentiable objectives for model optimization. Recently, inspired by the success of contrastive
learning [6, 11], the community has shifted towards constructing self-supervision signals via data
augmentations, thus promoting the contrastive clustering paradigm [18, 46, 14]. The latest research
indicates that pseudo-labels could further enhance the clustering performance [38, 21, 29, 22].

Despite these merits, almost all deep clustering methods suffer from the performance ceiling due to
the limited information inherent in the data [19]. Particularly, this limitation is reflected in the poor
discrimination of hard boundary samples as shown in Fig. 1a. Consequently, it has a great chance to

includes visually similar but semantically different neighbors (red boxes), leading to a performance
bottleneck. (b) Instead of exhaustively mining internal semantics from data, we propose incorpo-

improve the overall performance remarkably through mining hard samples. Current pseudo-labeling
strategies, however, focus on easy samples with high-confident cluster predictions, while failing
to handle hard boundary samples with unreliable predictions. To tackle hard samples, a recent
effort attempts to mitigate their impact by neglecting them when constructing neighborhoods [45].
Nevertheless, this approach, akin to an ostrich avoidance policy, essentially sidesteps the core problem
rather than solving it, ultimately leaving hard samples inseparable.

Acknowledging limitations in tackling hard samples internally, we present a straightforward approach
by incorporating external user interaction, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. In brief, given an arbitrary pre-
trained clustering model, we aim to correct its cluster assignments of hard samples with minimal user
interaction overhead. To achieve this, we confront two challenges: i) constructing an efficient and user-
friendly interaction interface, and ii) effectively utilizing user feedback. To tackle the first challenge,
we present a novel strategy to mine valuable samples based on hardness, representativeness, and
diversity for user inquiries with mathematical formulations. Here, the representativeness is designed
to avoid selecting outliers and the diversity is used to prevent the selected samples from collapsing
into a small number of clusters. For user convenience, instead of directly requesting class labels,
we inquire about the affiliation of each selected sample with its nearest cluster centers. For the
second challenge, we design two new losses to finetune the pre-trained model using both positive and
negative user feedback. Specifically, positive feedback indicates the semantic alignment w.r.t. the
selected cluster, while negative feedback denies all candidate clusters as semantically inconsistent.
Additionally, we propose a regularization loss to preserve the overall cluster boundary of the original
model, preventing it from overfitting the inquired samples. Notably, our method is a model-irrelevant
plug-in that can be effortlessly integrated into existing clustering methods, thereby enhancing their
performance.

The major contributions of this work could be summarized as follows:

• We propose incorporating external user interaction to break through the performance ceil-
ing of existing deep clustering methods, specifically correcting the hard samples that are
indistinguishable internally.

• To reduce interaction costs, we present a value-mining strategy to select hard, representative,
and diverse samples for user inquiry. To simplify the interaction, we design a user-friendly
interface to ask for cluster affiliations of these selected valuable samples.

• The proposed IDC could be easily integrated into any pre-trained deep clustering model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IDC could significantly boost the performance
of various state-of-the-art deep clustering methods with negligible user interaction costs.

Related Work

In this section, we briefly review two fields related to this work, namely, deep clustering and hard
sample mining.

2.1
Deep Clustering

Thanks to the powerful feature extraction ability, deep clustering methods have shown promising
results on complex real-world data and advanced rapidly in past years [42, 43, 5, 15]. Recently,
the success of self-supervised learning [6, 11, 10] gives rise to a series of contrastive clustering
methods [18, 46, 21, 14]. However, even enhanced by data augmentation and pseudo-labeling
strategies [38, 29, 21, 4], the performance of existing deep clustering methods is inherently upper-
bounded by the limited internal supervision signals. Instead of exhaustively mining semantics from the
data, a recent work attempts to leverage external data and models to facilitate clustering [19]. Another
branch of study focuses on integrating prior class labels [3, 16] or pairwise constraints [39, 40, 24, 27]
into the clustering process to boost the performance.

Different from existing studies that pursue overall performance improvements, this work aims to
address the specific hard sample problem. Notably, the performance bottleneck of existing methods
lies in the poor discrimination for hard samples at the cluster boundaries. Given the difficulty of
internally correcting cluster assignments for hard boundary samples, we propose incorporating
external user interaction as a straightforward solution. By inquiring about the cluster affiliations of
representative and diverse hard samples, our method could significantly boost the performance of
pre-trained clustering models with low interaction overhead.

2.2
Hard Sample Mining

Hard samples refer to data points that are difficult to recognize and understand due to their ambiguous
or weak semantics, which widely exist in various tasks such as face recognition [33], person re-
identification [44], image segmentation [28], object detection [2], and cross-modal retrieval [23]. On
the one hand, the model is likely to make wrong predictions for these samples. On the other hand,
mining these samples could significantly improve the model performance. Notably, hard sample
mining is usually conducted in a supervised manner. For clustering, it is daunting to correct the
assignments of hard samples at cluster boundaries by the model itself due to the absence of class label
priors. As an attempt, SeCu [32] recently proposes assigning larger weights to hard samples when
computing cluster centers for better cluster discriminability. However, the improvement is limited
due to the unreliable cluster assignments of hard samples.

The differences between this work and previous hard sample mining methods are twofold. On the
one hand, most existing works focus on enclosed supervised learning, while we explore hard sample
mining for unsupervised clustering by incorporating user interaction. On the other hand, unlike
previous works that solely pursue sample hardness, we further consider the representativeness and
diversity of hard samples, resulting in a more comprehensive evaluation of data value. Such a value
mining strategy helps to improve the cluster model with interaction costs as low as possible.

Method

In this section, we introduce our novel Interactive Deep Clustering method (IDC). As illustrated in
Fig. 2, IDC consists of two primary stages: user interaction and model optimization. Initially, IDC
solicits the user to determine the cluster affiliation of highly valuable samples, which are strategically
selected based on their hardness, representativeness, and diversity. Subsequently, during the
model optimization stage, IDC refines the cluster assignments of these samples according to the user
feedback, while preserving the overall decision boundary of the pre-trained model. The two stages
are further detailed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

3.1
User Interaction

To boost the pre-trained clustering model with minimal user interaction cost, we select the most
valuable samples for user inquiries. The value of each sample is appraised based on three proposed

Figure 2: The overall framework of IDC consists of two stages: user interaction and model op-
timization. In the user interaction stage, given a pre-trained clustering model, IDC first selects
high-value samples based on hardness, representativeness, and diversity. Then it inquires the user
about the affiliations of the selected samples relative to their nearest cluster centers. In the model
optimization stage, IDC utilizes both positive and negative user feedback to finetune the pre-trained
model with positive and negative losses for cluster performance improvement. Meanwhile, IDC
adopts a regularization loss on high-confident predictions to prevent overfitting inquired samples.

criteria: hardness h, representativeness r, and diversity d, encapsulated by the equation:

vi = hi + ri + di,
(1)

where vi denotes the importance of the i-th sample. We elaborate on the three metrics as follows:

Hardness. Typically, a pre-trained clustering model could accurately assign clusters to easy samples
near cluster centers. However, it may fail on hard samples situated at cluster peripheries. In
other words, identifying these boundary samples is pivotal for boosting the clustering performance.
Therefore, we quantify the hardness of the i-th sample by its proximity to cluster centers:

hi = log(1 −zi · cg1 + zi · cg2),
(2)

where zi is the L2-normalized feature of the i-th sample, and cg1, cg2 denote the closest and second-
closet cluster centers to zi, respectively. A higher hi score indicates greater uncertainty in cluster
assignment for the i-th sample.

Representativeness. While correcting hard samples is beneficial, focusing solely on hardness may
lead to suboptimal results, as the most challenging samples could be outliers that negatively impact
the model’s generalization ability. To tackle this problem, we prefer samples reside in dense regions,
where inquiring about a single sample could correct the cluster assignments of numerous adjacent
ones. Formally, we define the representativeness of the i-th sample by the density of its K nearest
neighbors as follows:

ri = −log

K
X

j=1
∥zi −zi(j)∥2
2,
(3)

where zi(j) refers to the j-th nearest neighbor of zi, and K is the number of nearest neighbors
empirically set to 20. A higher ri score suggests a more compact local structure, indicating that the
i-th sample is more representative.

Diversity. In practice, we discover that pursuing hardness and representativeness may result in
an unbalanced sample distribution, heavily collapsing into a small number of clusters as shown in
Fig. 3. To avoid this, we present the “diversity” metric to ensure sufficient dispersion of the selected
samples. Different from hardness and representativeness which are independent of the selection,

the diversity of a given sample is measured by its deviation from previously selected samples. In
our implementation, the sample with the highest vi score is selected iteratively until M samples
are selected. In each iteration, the diversity of the i-th sample is computed according to the already
selected samples:
di = min
j∈S
log(1 −zi · zj),
(4)

where S represents the indices of the selected samples.

For user interaction, we select the top M = 500 valuable samples with the highest vi scores in our
experiments. The selection process is outlined in Algorithm 1. According to Theorem 1 proved
below, IDC could select the most valuable samples to minimize the user interaction cost.
Theorem 1. The value of the selected sample decreases as the selection progresses, i.e.,

vj
sj ≥vj+1
sj+1, ∀j ∈[1, M −1].
(5)

where sj denotes the index of the j-th selected sample, and vj
i denotes the i-th sample’s value in the
j-th selection.

Proof. We denote Sj as the set of selected sample indices and Rj as the set of remaining sample
indices after the j-th selection. Further, the i-th sample’s hardness, representativeness, and diversity
in the j-th selection (i.e., i ∈Rj−1) are denoted as hj
i, rj
i , and dj
i, respectively. By the definition of
sample value in Eq. (1), we have
vj
i = hj
i + rj
i + dj
i,
(6)
Notably, since we choose sj instead of sj+1 in the j-th selection, there must be

vj
sj ≥vj
sj+1.
(7)

By the definition of diversity in Eq. (4), we have

dj
sj+1 = min
i∈Sj−1 log(1 −zsj+1 · zi) ≥min
i∈Sj log(1 −zsj+1 · zi) = dj+1
sj+1,
(8)

where the inequality holds since Sj = Sj−1∪{sj} and thus Sj−1 ⊂Sj. Furthermore, as hardness and
representativeness scores are irrelevant to the selection process (i.e., hj
sj+1 = hj+1
sj+1, rj
sj+1 = rj+1
sj+1),
we have
vj
sj+1 = hj
sj+1 + rj
sj+1 + dj
sj+1 ≥hj+1
sj+1 + rj+1
sj+1 + dj+1
sj+1 = vj+1
sj+1.
(9)

Finally, by combining Eq. (7) and Eq. (9), we arrive at

vj
sj ≥vj
sj+1 ≥vj+1
sj+1,
(10)

which completes the proof of Theorem 1.

Upon selecting the most valuable samples, we inquire about their cluster affiliations relative to
the nearest cluster centers. For each selected sample, we provide T = 5 nearest cluster center
candidates 2, and then request the user to determine which candidate shares the same semantics with
the anchor as illustrated in Fig. 2. Notably, such an inquiry strategy is more user-friendly than directly
asking about the pair-wise correlation between two samples, by aiding users in grasping cluster
semantics and partitioning criteria. User feedback could be either positive (selecting a candidate) or
negative (rejecting all candidates) to the given sample, which serves the subsequent model finetuning
strategy introduced in the next section.

3.2
Model Optimization

Based on the user feedback, we present a positive loss Lpos, a negative loss Lneg, and a regularization
loss Lreg to finetune the clustering model:

L = Lpos + Lneg + Lreg.
(11)

The three loss terms are designed to utilize positive feedback, to use negative feedback, and to prevent
overfitting the queried samples, respectively, with details provided below.

Positive Loss. Positive user feedback refers to identifying the cluster centroid sharing the same
semantics with the inquiry sample. To exploit this feedback, we draw the sample and the cluster
centroid closer by the following positive loss:

Lpos = −
1
Mpos

Mpos
X

i=1

C
X

j=1
yij log pij,
(12)

where Mpos denotes the count of positive feedback, C is the number of clusters, pij refers to the
probability of sample i belonging to cluster j, and yij ∈{0, 1} is an indicator that equals one iff the
j-th cluster is selected by user.

Negative Loss. Negative user feedback indicates that no candidates match the semantics of the
inquiry sample. To leverage the feedback, we enforce the sample apart from all candidate clusters
using the following negative loss:

Lneg = −
1
Mneg

Mneg
X

i=1

C
X

j=1
˜yij log(1 −pij),
(13)

where Mneg is the count of negative feedback, and ˜yij is an indicator that equals one if the j-th
cluster is the randomly chosen candidate, and zero otherwise.

Regularization Loss. To reduce the interaction cost, only a small amount of samples are selected for
user interaction. However, exclusively finetuning the model with the above two losses risks overfitting
to the inquiry samples, potentially compromising previously correct cluster predictions. To tackle
this problem, we propose preserving the overall cluster boundary by retaining confident predictions.
Formally, the regularization loss is defined as follows:

Lreg = −1

N

N
X

i=1
1[piˆj > τ] log piˆj, ˆj = argmax pi
(14)

where N is the count of all samples, τ = 0.99 is the confidence threshold, 1[cond] ∈{0, 1} is an
indicator that equals one iff the condition cond holds.

The above three losses are applied to optimize the pre-trained clustering model for performance
improvement. After finetuning, we could directly obtain the improved cluster assignments from the
model’s cluster head3.

2In practice, each cluster center is represented by its nearest sample.
3We append a cluster head for pre-trained clustering models that do not have one. More details are provided
in Section 4.2.

Experiments

In this section, we first apply the proposed IDC to two state-of-the-art deep clustering methods,
and evaluate the performance on five widely used image clustering benchmarks. Then we conduct
ablation studies and parameter analyses to validate the robustness and effectiveness of IDC.

4.1
Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate IDC on five widely used image clustering datasets, including CIFAR-10 [17], CIFAR-20
[17], STL-10 [8], ImageNet-10 [5] and ImageNet-Dogs [5], as detailed in Table 1.

Three widely used clustering metrics are adopted for performance evaluation, including Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI), Accuracy (ACC), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Higher scores signify
superior clustering results.

4.2
Implementation Details

Without loss of generality, we apply the proposed IDC on two recent methods TCL [21] and
ProPos [14], on behalf of deep clustering models with and without a cluster head, respectively.
Notably, for clustering models without a cluster head like ProPos, we append a randomly initialized
two-layer fully connected network as an alternative. In the model optimization stage, we finetune
the pre-trained clustering model for 100 epochs. For ProPos, we warm up the cluster head with the
positive and negative loss in Eq. 12 and 13 in the first 50 epochs, since the prediction confidences
are unreliable initially. To balance the effect of user feedback and model regularization, we use
two independent data loaders for the inquiry and confident samples, with batch sizes of 100 and
500, respectively. All images are augmented consistently with the pre-trained clustering model
for finetuning, while the original images are used for value evaluation and pseudo-labeling. All
experiments are conducted on a single Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU on the Ubuntu 20.04 platform with
CUDA 12.0.

4.3
Comparisons with State of the Arts

We first compare the proposed IDC with 14 recent deep clustering methods, including CC [18],
SCAN [38], NMM [9], MiCE [37], BYOL [10], GCC [46], SPICE [29], IDFD [36], TCC [34],
DivClust [26], SeCu [32], CoNR [45], TCL [21], and ProPos [14]. In addition, we include two repre-
sentative semi-supervised classification and clustering baselines FixMatch [35] and Cop-Kmeans [40]
for benchmarking. For FixMatch, we use the ResNet-34 [12] as the backbone and annotate the inquiry
images with positive user feedback for fair comparisons. For Cop-Kmeans, we use the TCL image
features as the input and transform the user feedback as must- and cannot-link constraints.

As shown in Table 2, IDC gains consistent performance improvement, especially on more challenging
datasets. Specifically, IDC boosts the clustering accuracy of TCL/ProPos by 16.3%/19.2% and
14.4%/9.2% on CIFAR-20 and ImageNet-Dogs, respectively. Besides, the results show that solely
correcting the cluster assignments of 500 samples brings marginal performance improvement, since
they are only a small portion of the data. Notably, IDC also outperforms the semi-supervised baseline
FixMatch. Such a result could be attributed to its customized valuable sample selection strategy.
Namely, the selected inquiry samples are catered to the pre-trained clustering model, which may not
suit the general semi-supervised classification. Moreover, the superior performance of IDC compared
with Cop-Kmeans demonstrates its stronger ability to utilize user feedback for model optimization.

Ablation Study and Parameter Analysis

To prove the robustness and effectiveness of IDC, we conduct ablation studies and parameter analyses
on the TCL-based model. Specifically, for the user interaction stage, we study the effectiveness of the
valuable sample selection strategy, as well as the impact of the number of selected samples M and
candidate cluster centers T. For the model optimization stage, we investigate the effectiveness of the
three loss terms.

Effectiveness of the valuable sample selection strategy. As detailed in Section 3.1, starting with the
clustering hardness, we additionally consider representativeness and diversity to quantify the value
of each sample. Here, to provide an intuitive understanding of the three criteria, we visualize the
selected samples among all data points in Fig. 3. As can be seen, solely considering hardness would
select most boundary samples, which are not representative enough and thus sub-optimal for reducing

the interaction cost. When additionally considering the representativeness, however, the selected
samples would collapse into dense subsets, leading to a significant performance drop as shown in
Table 3. Finally, further integrating the diversity results in samples simultaneously comprising the
three expected characteristics, which gives the best clustering performance.

Impact of the number of selected samples and candidates. For interaction cost reduction, we
select M = 500 most valuable samples for the user inquiry, and T = 5 nearest cluster centers as the
candidates. Here, we investigate how different numbers of M and T influence the final clustering
performance. As depicted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), the performance of IDC improves as the number
of selected samples increases. Notably, the improvement grows rapidly at the start but gradually
levels off as more samples are selected. Moreover, valuable samples selected by IDC consistently
outperform the random selection baseline. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of
our valuable sample selection strategy, but also verify the monotonously decreased sample value as
proved in Theorem 1. For the number of candidates, Fig. 4 (c) shows that comparing the inquiry
sample with the five nearest centers strikes the best balance between performance and interaction
cost.

combination of the three losses and the results are shown in Fig. 4. On the one hand, no single loss is
adequate to yield promising clustering results. In particular, solely leveraging the negative loss would
deny all the Top-5 predictions and thus severely damage the decision boundary of the pre-trained
clustering model, leading to the model collapse. On the other hand, each loss is indispensable
during the model optimization. Notably, the positive loss brings the most substantial performance
improvement, as it offers the most direct clustering guidance to the model.

Conclusion

Instead of mining semantics from internal data, we propose an interactive deep clustering method
IDC, which incorporates user interaction to address the hard sample problem. By mathematically
measuring the sample value defined on hardness, representativeness, and diversity, IDC selects the
highest-value samples and inquiries about their cluster affiliations through a user-friendly interaction
interface. By fine-tuning the pre-trained clustering model leveraging user feedback, IDC remarkably
improves the performance of various state-of-the-art deep clustering methods. For future studies,
one potential direction is to consider the mistakes in user feedback, and correspondingly improve
the robustness of IDC. Another possible direction is to design a more advanced interaction pipeline,
for aligning clustering results with the user’s personalized partition criterion. In general, we hope
this work could provide novel insight to the community, attracting more attention to the interactive
clustering paradigm which is a promising and less explored area.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations in the Conclusion section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

13


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper provides the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct)
proof.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

14


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The data is widely used and is available to everyone. We are now organizing
our code and will release it soon.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper specifies all the training and test details necessary to understand the
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Previous deep clustering works didn’t report the error bars. Therefore, it’s
meaningless to report the error bars since there’s no comparison since we don’t have enough
computer resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

15


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We introduce user interaction and the time of interaction is uncontrollable.
Besides, the time for fine-tuning is up to the pre-trained model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conduct in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

16


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
