Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text
understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs
(Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simul-
taneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient
number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information
(i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the
advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address
this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances
the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level
visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment
based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to
extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module
is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global
low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to
tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strate-
gies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning
capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically
devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal under-
standing tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our
proposed FineAction-CGR.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional text
understanding capabilities. Building on the strengths of LLMs, video large language models (Vid-
LLMs) [15, 18, 42] adapt them to the video modality, extending their reasoning and interactive skills
to video data. By training on video-level tasks like captioning and question answering, they establish
coarse-grained video-language correspondence and acquire the capabilities of video understanding.

While Vid-LLMs have demonstrated the promising performance in video understanding, they still face
a significant challenge. To embed video features into LLMs under computing resource constraints,
Vid-LLMs typically need to sparsely sample the original video (e.g., retaining one frame every
second) into a collection of low-frequency frames. Subsequently, the token number of each frame are
also compressed through a visual adapter like average pooling [16] or Q-former [14]. This leads to
a dilemma: Vid-LLMs have to choose between compromised frame-level features and video-level
features, each resulting in a reduction of video information. As illustrated in Figure 1 (a), under
the premise of a constant total token number, we investigate the performance of Vid-LLMs by

dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency and frame token number. The results clearly show
that both low sampling frequency and low frame token number lead to performance degradation.
Low-frequency sampling results in a sparse image collection as input, omitting crucial temporal
details. On the other hand, excessive frame-feature compression degrades the semantic and spatial
contexts of each frame. When confronted with fine-grained video understanding tasks, this limitation
becomes significantly evident, as depicted in Figure 1 (b). Existing models (e.g., LLaMA-VID [17])
often overlook crucial details early in the input due to low-frequency sampling, leading to inaccuracy.

To address this challenge, we introduce SlowFocus, which is designed to pinpoint relevant temporal
segments in response to questions, and subsequently maintains high-quality temporal details to enrich
fine-grained video comprehension. For video understanding tasks, we assume that the relevant details
are concentrated within one or several clips. SlowFocus initially identifies these segments based on
the provided questions. It then densely samples the segmented temporal clips at a high-frequency to
extract local temporal features highly pertinent to the questions. To effectively model the temporal
relationships between frames and capture inter-frame contexts, we propose a specialized temporal
encoder and a multi-frequency mixing attention module for enhanced temporal comprehension.

To enhance Vid-LLMs’ ability to perform SlowFocus based on mixed frequencies, we propose a set
of training and inference strategies to improve their temporal localization and fine-grained temporal
reasoning capability. Following VTimeLLM [10], we fine-tune our Vid-LLM in the second stage
on dense video captioning and temporal grounding tasks. This process enhances the model’s ability
to predict discrete bins that define the relevant temporal segments. In the third stage, we adapt the
Vid-LLM to the SlowFocus mechanism for high-quality, fine-grained temporal-related tasks, which
enables our model to reason precisely based on high-frequency temporal details.

In addition to the scarcity of methods for fine-grained video understanding, existing benchmarks [37,
40] also fall short in providing adequate challenges for specific temporal-related tasks. To bridge
this gap and evaluate our proposed framework, we introduce FineAction-CGR, a newly dedicated
benchmark that focuses on fine-grained video understanding, especially reasoning tasks based on
temporal details. Our method demonstrates superior performance on the proposed benchmark,
offering a promising solution to high-quality video understanding.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) We introduce SlowFocus, a straight-
forward yet effective framework designed to resolve the prevalent trade-off in existing Vid-LLMs
between capturing limited frame-level details and overarching video-level contexts. SlowFocus
adeptly maintains high-frequency local details alongside low-frequency global contexts, facilitating
the identification of pertinent temporal segments and precise reasoning on video contents. (ii) We
present a novel training strategy specifically designed to enhance the temporal localization abilities
of Vid-LLMs, and seamlessly adapt them to our newly proposed SlowFocus approach. (iii) We
establish a comprehensive new benchmark and carry out extensive experiments to rigorously assess
the fine-grained video understanding capabilities of Vid-LLMs. The empirical evidence strongly

indicates that our SlowFocus approach significantly outperforms existing models, particularly in tasks

Vision large language models. Researchers have made significant efforts to enable Large Language
Models(LLMs) to comprehend visual information. BLIP-2 [14] aligns vision-language representation
with a lightweight Querying Transformer by concept of Q-Former. MiniGPT-4 [45] aligns detailed
image descriptions with advanced LLM which significantly enhances its multi-modal abilities.
Exploring diverse multi-modal instruction-following data, LLaVA [20] has demonstrated impressive
multi-model chat abilities. Recent LLMs, like Kosmos-2 [26] and VisionLLM [33], probed into
more specific aspects of image comprehension, including referring and grounding [27], remarkably
enhancing the capability to describe intricate image details.

Video large language models. The exploration of LLMs’ potential has been extended from images
to videos, which contributes to emergence of Video LLMs. VideoChat [15] combines fine-tuning and
LLM-based video agents and is fine-tuned using a specially designed video-centric instruction dataset.
Video-ChatGPT [23] proposes a novel human assisted and semi-automatic annotation framework for
generation high quality instruction data for videos. Video-LLaMA [42], trained on vision-language
branch and audio-language branch separately with same visual data and process, has demonstrated
impressive abilities in understanding both visual and auditory content in videos. Video-LLaVA [18]
learns united visual representation by alignment before projection and conducts joint training on
images and videos simultaneously. With efforts, Video LLMs have exhibited powerful task-handling
capabilities in downstream tasks, like text-video retrieval and video captioning. However, these
models remain limited in ability to comprehend fine-grained content. To solve this problem, we
introduce a model with powerful capability of fine-grained video understanding.

Fine-grained video understanding. Comprehending videos in fine-grained aspects requires precisely
locating and understanding specific events within a video. It is roughly divided by previous works [10]
into temporal grounding [2, 7] and dense video captioning [13, 31] tasks. Temporal grounding
demands the model to precisely identify start and end timestamps of video segment according to
a given text query. Dense video captioning requires both temporal localization and captioning for
all events within an untrimmed video. Both tasks are constrained by the labor-intensive nature
of annotation, resulting in relatively small datasets. Moreover, fine-grained video understanding
demands a deep comprehension of how objects change and interact over time, particularly at a detailed
level. This complexity necessitates temporal reasoning tasks to effectively analyze these dynamics.
However, current research in this field falls short of adequately addressing these requirements. To
solve this problem, our proposed large-scale dataset provides mass temporal annotations and captions
in different dimensions, supplying a wealth of information for training in temporal video grounding
and reasoning tasks.

Method

In this section, we begin with a preliminary overview of video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) in Section 3.1.
Following that, we offer a comprehensive explanation of our proposed SlowFocus in Section 3.2,
followed by a detailed introduction to our innovative training strategy in Section 3.3.

3.1
Preliminary

Contemporary Vid-LLMs typically feature a modular architecture, which includes a visual encoder
EV , a series of visual adapters Q, and a large language model L. For a given video V = {V (t) ∈
RH×W ×3|t = 0, ..., T} that consists of T frames, along with its associated question q, Vid-LLMs
generally perform downsampling on the original video V at a fixed interval ML. This process results
in sparsely distributed frames VL:

VL = {V (MLt) ∈RH×W ×3|t = 0, ..., T},
(1)

where ML ≫1. Consequently, only a very limited number of frames (T/ML ≪T) are selected as
the actual input for the Vid-LLM, a technique we refer to as low-frequency sampling in this study.

Figure 2: The framework of SlowFocus. We initially identify the relevant temporal segments based
on the given query. Subsequently the high-frequency sampling is performed on these segmented
clips. Combined with low-frequency sampling across the entire video, our SlowFocus mechanism
maintains mixed-frequency visual tokens to accurately answer the query.

Subsequently, the visual encoder processes the downsampled frames VL and encodes them into a
series of visual tokens denoted as zL = EV (VL). These visual tokens are then transformed to align
with the embedding space of the language model through the visual adapter Q, resulting in aligned
visual tokens hL = Q(zL). Concurrently, the input text query q is encoded into linguistic tokens
hq by the textual encoder. These visual and text tokens are concatenated into a unified sequence
[hL, hq], which then serves as the input for the decoder component of the large language model L.
The model leverages this combined representation to infer the appropriate answer ans = L([hL, hq]),
showcasing its ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and respond to human queries.

Although this paradigm is well developed in the field of video understanding, it encounters significant
limitations in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. By retaining only a small, discontinu-
ous subset of frames (t, where t ≪T), substantial information loss can occur, as depicted in Figure 1
(b). Fine-grained temporal video understanding demands that the model concentrate on one or more
specific temporal intervals, which could be potentially brief. However, the low-frequency sampling
method predominantly captures overarching information while neglecting crucial local details, lead-
ing to inaccuracies such as incorrect responses or hallucinations. To address these shortcomings, we
develop the SlowFocus strategy.

3.2
SlowFocus

To improve Vid-LLMs with the SlowFocus mechanism, we first expand the traditional training and
inference paradigm by introducing Mixed-Frequency Sampling (MFS). Subsequently, we explicitly
model the temporal relationships among the sampled frames. Finally, we enhance the visual tokens
with our newly proposed multiple-frequency mixing attention, designed to capture long-term contexts.
We now provide a detailed elaboration on each of these components.

Relevant segment grounding. To better mimic human cognition in our Vid-LLM, we transform its
inference paradigm into a multi-round dialogue format that integrates both the query and temporal
awareness elements. The methodology of this transformation is illustrated in Figure 2. Initially,
we sample the entire video at a fixed interval to capture the low-frequency frames VL, which are
then encoded into visual embeddings hL. Following that, we reformat the original question q into
temporal grounding questions q1, such as “<video>\nPlease provide the temporal segment help to
reason the question: <question>”, where <question> refers to the original question q.

each stage. <image> and <video> denote the tokens for image and video, respectively.

With the augmented question q1, we direct the Vid-LLM to identify the relevant temporal segments τ
within the video that are pertinent to the original question q. This is accomplished by providing the
model with low-frequency frames containing global information:

τ = L([hL, hq1]),
(2)

where hq1 represents the textual embedding of question q1 and τ ⊂[0, T]. The identified segment τ
is designed to encompass query-related details that are crucial for addressing the question q.

Mixed-frequency sampling. Subsequently, we perform dense sampling on the identified segment τ
to obtain high-frequency frames VH:

VH = {V (MHt) ∈RH×W ×3|t ∈τ}, MH = max( |τ|

NH
, 1).
(3)

We dynamically adjust the sampling interval MH based on the temporal length of segment |τ| and
to ensure an adequate number of samples NH are taken from the relevant segment. The densely
sampled frames VH are then encoded into high-frequency visual tokens hH by visual encoder.

With the inclusion of local details from high-frequency frames, we augment the initial question q with
prompts, such as “Additional temporal clues to focus on: ...”, to form q2, as illustrated in Figure 2.
We then combine the mixed-frequency visual tokens to predict the final answer:

ans = L([hL, π(hL, hH), hq2]),
(4)

where π is the multiple-frequency mixing attention, which will be detailed subsequently.

Multiple-frequency mixing attention. Because of the roughness of the low-frequency and the
detailed specificity of the high-frequency visual features, simply concatenating these two directly into
the language model may not yield optimal results. Fine-grained temporal understanding often requires
modeling relationships between multiple events, necessitating the integration of global contexts into
high-frequency local features. From this perspective, we introduce the Multiple-frequency Mixing
Attention (MMA):

π(hL, hH) = softmax(hHhT
L
√

d
)hL,
(5)

where, for simplicity, we omit the process of applying FFN to hL and hH. The resulting output is
then fed into LLM to predict the textual response, as described in Equation 4.

Temporal relationship modeling. While LLM can implicitly capture temporal relationships among
input visual embeddings based on their sequential positioning, it faces difficulties when the visual
tokens are not uniformly distributed along the timeline. To address this challenge, we propose a
temporal encoder that encodes the relative positions of frames into a set of discretized temporal

embeddings are then incorporated into the visual tokens by directly adding them to the frame features.

3.3
Training strategy

Considering training efficiency, we introduce a novel training procedure which is structured into three
distinct phases in this work: (i) pre-training for modality alignment, (ii) fine-tuning for enhancing
temporal grounding, and (iii) SlowFocus adaption, as illustrated in Figure 3. We now provide detailed
elaborations on the training strategies and datasets employed for each of these stages.

Modality alignment. In the pre-training stage, our primary focus is to optimize the visual adapters and
temporal encoders, while the visual encoder and language model are frozen to ensure that the visual
features align effectively with the language space. Following the approach used in LLaMA-VID [16],
we utilize the image-text LCS-558K dataset from LLaVA [20], along with 232K video-caption
samples from the WebVid 2.5M [3].

Boundary enhancement. After the pre-training stage, the Vid-LLM gains proficiency in processing
visual information. During the fine-tuning stage, we focus on enhancing the model’s ability to
comprehend sequences of video frames, thereby improving its temporal localization capabilities. In
alignment with practices from VTimeLLM [10], we employ the InternVid-10M-FLT dataset [34],
which is specifically designed for temporal-awareness training. The tasks within this dataset in-
clude: (i) dense video captioning, which requires detailed descriptions of all events along with their
corresponding timestamps, and (ii) segment captioning and temporal video grounding, which in-
volve generating descriptions based on timestamps or determining timestamps based on descriptions.
Throughout this stage, we continue to train the visual adapters and temporal encoders. Additionally,
the LLM is further trained using LoRA [9] to refine its capabilities.

SlowFocus adaption. Following the fine-tuning stage, our model has demonstrated the ability to
comprehensively understand activities within the video and accurately align them with their respective
timestamps. In the final stage, to further enhance multi-modality comprehension and integration with
the MMF mechanism, we construct an instruction-tuning dataset using samples from ActivityNet
Captions [13] and FineAction [21]. We transform the annotations into over 100K high-quality
QA dialogues, which will be detailed in the subsequent section. In alignment with our SlowFocus
mechanism, during training with fine-grained captioning and reasoning tasks, the model is provided
with the ground-truth temporal segments τGT and subjected to mixed-frequency sampling. In this

FineAction-CGR benchmark

In addition to the scarcity of previous methods for fine-grained video understanding, existing bench-
marks [37, 40] do not adequately challenge specific temporal-related tasks. To address this gap
and evaluate our proposed framework, we introduce FineAction-CGR, a comprehensive and high-
quality instruction-following benchmark designed for evaluating the capabilities of Video LLMs in
fine-grained video understanding. FineAction [21] is a large-scale and fine-grained video dataset en-
compassing diverse action categories with detailed annotations of action instances and time segments.
For the purpose of SlowFocus adaption and model evluation, we divide the FineAction dataset into
training and testing sets based on videos, allocating 75% to the training set and 25% to the test set,
ensuring these is no overlap between them. Building on this foundation, we probe time information
and content information from FineAction and expand it into multi-tasks. This section outlines the data
construction procedures, which consist of three main steps: (i) video preprocessing, (ii) annotation
construction, and (iii) formation of downstream tasks. More details are included in the appendix.

Video preprocessing. As depicted in Step I of Figure 4, we employ a modified two-stage splitting
algorithm from Panda70M [5] to segment videos into clips, thereby providing raw materials for
fine-grained information at the clip level. This preprocessing step yields 62,912 video clips.

Annotation construction. Step II in Figure 4 outlines our approach to creating new annotations,
which include time segments, captions, and action labels. Given the high cost of using GPT-4V [1] for
generating large-scale, clip-level captions, we generate detailed captions for entire videos with GPT-
4V and then use a fine-tuned Video Recaptioner Model to produce large-scale, clip-level captions.
By integrating action labels and time segments from the ground truth with clip segments and the
generated captions, we create comprehensive new annotations.

Formation of downstream tasks. Utilizing the new annotations, we design four types of video
instruction-following tasks, as illustrated in Step III of Figure 4: (i) segmented captioning, (ii)
temporal video grounding, (iii) temporal video reasoning and (iv) multi-turn QA. Detailed information
on construction procedures, task formats, prompts, and case studies can be found in Appendix C- E.

Evaluation protocol. To assess the capability of video language model in comprehending fine-grained
video understanding tasks, we integrate multiple evaluation metrics in comprehensively evaluate the
model’s performance against our proposed benchmark. For temporal grounding task, we calculate
the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the temporal segments generated by the model and the
corresponding ground truth, and we report meanIoU (mIoU) metric. For segmented captioning,
we employ commonly accepted captioning-based metric, including BLEU [25], METEOR [4],
ROUGE [19] and CIDEr [30]. For temporal reasoning task, we utilize GPT-4 [1] to evaluate the
accuracy and score of the generated answers.

Experiments

5.1
Experiment setup

In our experiments, we implement LLaMA-VID [17] as baseline and utilize Vicuna-7B v1.5 [44]
as our foundational LLM. More implementation details are provided in the appendix. We adjust
the resolution of input videos to 224 × 224, and each frame is condensed into 64 tokens. The
low-frequency sampling interval ML is set to match the original video fps, ensuring one frame is
sampled every second. We define the dense sampling number NH as 20 and the size of temporal
token space N as 1000. The AdamW [22] optimizer is applied with a cosine learning rate and decay
and a warm-up period. We train our Vid-LLM for three stages. During the initial pre-training stage,
the learning rate is set to 1 × 10−3. For the subsequent fine-tuning stages, the learning rate is adjusted
to 2 × 10−4. Additionally, the LoRA parameters are configured with r = 64 and alpha = 128. All
experiments are conducted on 8 V100 GPUs.

5.2
Main results

Results on fine-grained video understanding. We evaluate the performance of existing Vid-
LLMs on our proposed fine-grained video understanding benchmark FineAction-CGR, as detailed in
Table 1. Further specifics are available in the appendix. Our method significantly outperforms other
counterparts, achieving a mIoU of 66.68 for temporal grounding and an accuracy of 53.10% for the
reasoning task. Notably, most other models, with the exception of VTimeLLM [10], exhibit subpar
performance in both the temporal grounding and reasoning tasks on the benchmark. We propose
several possible explanations for this observation: (i) These models lack sensitivity to precise time

boundaries, making it challenging for them to accurately predict temporal segments. (ii) Due to their
reliance on low-frequency sampling, these models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal details,
which adversely affects their performance on tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning.

We also fine-tune the baseline using stage 3. To ensure fairness, the implementation details for baseline
fine-tuning are kept consistent with those of our method. The baseline’s performance improves
because stage 3 includes tasks focused on temporal grounding and is specifically designed for
fine-grained analysis. Furthermore, the remaining performance gap further supports our explanations.

Results on coarse-grained video-based benchmarks. In Table 2, we present a comparative
evaluation of our method against various state-of-the-art methods across three zero-shot video-
QA benchmarks: MSVD-QA [36], MSRVTT-QA [37], and ActivityNet-QA [40]. We also conduct
experiments on the video-based generative performance benchmark [23]. The results demonstrate
that the proposed SlowFocus mechanism not only enhances fine-grained video understanding but
also delivers competitive performance in coarse-grained video understanding tasks, achieving results
on par with state-of-the-art models.

Results on long video benchmarks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on more challenging scenarios, we provide evaluations on long video benchmarks, includ-
ing MovieChat-1K [28] and EgoSchema [24]. As shown in Table 3, we evaluate our method on
MovieChat-1K. The results show that although our method is not specifically trained on long video
benchmarks (in contrast, MovieChat [28] has undergone targeted training for long videos), it still
achieves competitive results (58.6% accuracy in global mode and 48.1% in breakpoint mode).

Additionally, we also conduct experiments on EgoSchema [24] benchmark, as detailed in Table 4.
The results further demonstrate that, despite not being specifically trained on long video datasets, our
method still achieves competitive performance.

Qualitative results. Figure 5 illustrates the qualitative results of our method on different videos. Our
SlowFocus comprehensively analyzes the entire video, accurately identifies relevant temporal details
based on the posed question, and provides precise answer within the context of videos.

Ablations

In this section, we provide detailed ablation studies of our method conducted utilizing Vicuna-7B as
the foundation model.

Component-wise analysis. We first investigate the impact of each proposed component in Table 5.
Importantly, we observe that the baseline model, which relies solely on low-frequency frames (VL),
achieves limited performance, with an mIoU of 32.54 and an accuracy of 30.25. This highlights the

challenges faced by current Vid-LLMs in addressing fine-grained temporal tasks using only low-
frequency sampling. Additionally, the results in the second row indicate that the inclusion of MFS
significantly improves reasoning capabilities, resulting in an accuracy increase of +8.87. Furthermore,
the temporal encoder, which models temporal relationships effectively, boosts both grounding and
reasoning capabilities, with an increase of +22.45 in mIoU and +7.25 in accuracy. Increasing the
high-frequency sampling number NH from 10 to 20 leads to a noticeable performance gain (+7.66 in
mIoU and +5.31 in accuracy), although further increasing NH to 40 offers only marginal benefits.
Lastly, the MMA module contribute an accuracy enhancement of +1.42.

Necessity of fine-tuning strategy. We also analyze the impact of each training stage, as reported
in Table 6. Directly evaluating the pre-trained model after stage 1 yields poor performance. Based
on necessary pre-training stage 1, when only utilizing stage 2 for boundary enhancement, there is a
significant improvement by 51.56 in mIoU in temporal grounding ability. Furthermore, implementing
only stage 3 for SlowFocus adaptation boosts the performance in temporal reasoning by 25.14 in
accuracy. Integrating these stages results in the highest performance in both mIoU and accuracy
metrics, highlighting the irreplaceability of our proposed comprehensive training strategy.

What contributes more to fine-grained video understanding? In Table 7, we conduct further
experiments to explore how changes in sampling frequency and the number of frame tokens influence
our method. For meaningful comparison, we maintain constant total token numbers while gradually
decreasing the sampling frequency. The results indicate that within proposed SlowFocus, performance
improves with an increase in frame tokens and remains relatively unaffected by a decrease in global
sampling frequency. This demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in high-frequency sampling and
effectively alleviates the trade-off dilemma between sampling frequency and frame tokens.

Ablation on discretized temporal space. We investigate the influence of temporal token space N in
Table 8. The results demonstrate that when the token space increase from 0.1K to 1K, a significant
improvement (+22.87 in mIoU and +13.69 in accuracy) occurs. While further increasing N from 1K
to 10K, the performance drops instead.

Conclusion and limitations

Conclusion. We introduce SlowFocus, a straightforward yet potent mechanism that significantly
enhances fine-grained video understanding. Our approach improves the temporal localization capa-
bilities of Vid-LLMs, enabling them to precisely identify relevant temporal segments based on the
given query. Moreover, with our newly developed temporal encoder and multi-frequency mixing
attention module, our method effectively models the temporal relationships among frames and cap-
tures inter-frame context. Demonstrating superior performance on our newly established fine-grained
video understanding benchmarks, we hope that our work can propel the development of Vid-LLMs in
achieving advanced video understanding.

Limitations. Despite significant advancements made in this work to enhance Vid-LLM’s access to
high-frequency temporal details and its temporal reasoning capabilities, challenges persist due to the
limited existing research on maintaining high resolution in video. Consequently, our method may
still encounter inaccurate predictions stemming from the ambiguity of spatial details.

Overview

In this appendix we present:

• Data construction details (Section C).

• Data statistics (Section D).

• Prompts used for instruction generation (Section E).

• Discussion on broader impacts (Section F).

B
More implementation details

In our work, we employ CLIP-ViT-L-14 for the frozen visual encoder, which accepts image resolutions
at 224 × 224 as input. For visual adapters, we follow LLaVA [20] to train a projector layer, aligning
visual features with the pre-trained LLM word embedding.

We also elaborate on how we enable LLM to predict temporal segments during stages 2 and 3
fine-tuning. Following VTimeLLM [10], we utilize the textual format “from s to e” to denote a
video clip, where s and e represent the starting and ending points, respectively. These time points
are normalized and range from 000 to 999, corresponding to the discretized temporal token space N.
During training, Vid-LLM is exposed to supervisory signals as described above, which enable it to
develop the capability to accurately locate temporal segments.

C
Data construction

Step I: video preprocessing. We split videos into video clips to provide raw materials for fine-grained
information in video clip level.

A proper splitting and stitching strategy is necessary. For one thing, the content of each clip should
be semantically consistent. Without this consistency, actions within the same video clip obtained by
erroneous segmentation can’t be inferred reasonably and in chronological order, which negatively
impacts the performance of downstream tasks such as action recognition and temporal reasoning.
For another, the video clips with insufficient information or that are too short are not suitable for
subsequent tasks, such as temporal grounding. Therefore, we adopt a modified two-stage splitting
algorithm in Panda70M [5] to obtain semantically consistent video clips.

In first stage, We collect time boundaries of events in the video. Instead of detecting abrupt changes
in pixels of adjacent frames, we detect lens switching so that actions in the same video clip can be
inferred reasonably. In second stage, we stitch adjacent events based on time boundaries in first stage.
Our stitching strategy could be depicted as merging short video clips and that are semantically similar.
To be specific, we merge current event with the previous, if one of the following two conditions is
met: 1)the video clip duration is less than five seconds, 2) the feature distance between the start frame
of the current event and the end frame of the previous event does not exceed 0.1. Finally, we split
videos into clips according to time boundaries from second stage.

Our adjusted splitting strategy has two advantages: 1) it preserves the information density of each
segment, ensuring that subsequently generated captions are reasonable; 2) it maintains logical
temporal consistency of actions within each segment, which facilitates the generation of question-
answer pairs in downstream tasks. Following the preprocessing step, we obtained 62,912 video
clips.

Step II: annotation construction. As Figure 4 illustrates, new annotations we construct consist of
time segments, captions and actions. (1) Action labels are from FineAction ground truth. (2) Time
segments cover clip’s time segments from above segmentation step and the action time segments
from ground truth. (3) Captions cover video captions and clip captions. We first utilzie GPT-4V
to generate detailed captions for entire videos. However, due to the cost of GPT-4V for generating
large-scale, clip-level video captions, we fine tune a Video Recaptioner Model based on the captions
generated by GPT-4V, which is then utilized to generate large-scale, clip-level captions. With actions

and time segments from ground truth, we integrate clip segments from splitting stage and captions
generated by GPT-4V and Video Recaptioner Model to get new, comprehensive annotations.

Step III: formation of downstream tasks. We design various types of instruction-following
tasks with different prompts to comprehensively train and evaluate Vid-LLMs. FineAction-CGR
encompasses 4 video tasks: (1) captioning, (2) temporal video grounding, (3) temporal video
reasoning and (4) multi-turn QA. A few examples from different tasks are shown in Figure 8-9.

Captioning task needs model to detects what actions occur in given period.

• Action recognition: recognize action in level of clip which may contain a kind of action or
several kinds of actions.

Temporal grounding tasks aims to predict the boundary in the video given an instruction in which
the start and end time of clip are mentioned to attract model’s attention to target segment. We design
two types of question to achieve fine-grained temporal localization.

• First/last time grounding: identify the fist/last time a certain action appears.

Temporal reasoning tasks requires model to understand relationship between actions.

• Action sequence reasoning: infer possible action before/after an action over a period of time.

• Count of times: counts times a certain action appears in a clip.

Multi-turn QA task contains multiple rounds of dialogues involving the above three tasks. The
problems are progressive from the entire video to the sub-segment.

Broader impacts

The proposed SlowFocus has the potential to greatly enhance the capability of Video LLMs for video
content analysis. Therefore it could be beneficial for applications such as video analytics, surveillance
and automated content moderation. It could also be used in educational settings to analyze educational
videos to provide a better understanding of complex contents in videos for educational purposes.

As for the potential negative impacts, there is a risk that the technology could be misused to analyze
private videos and spreading disinformation.

Prompts for Multi-turn QA

You are an excellent assistant for generating multi-round conversations. I need you to generate a 
dialogue with multi-turn questions and answers based on the information of a video. The information 
is a complete annotation of a video which contains one or more clips in chronological order. It mainly 
has captions, time segments and actions. Below is an example:

<Example 1>

and answers to test whether the deep learning model has capability of captioning, temporal 
grounding and especially temporal reasoning based on the information provided.

Captioning task contains video captioning, clip captioning and action recognition during a time 
peiord. Temporal grounding task needs to find out target time period according to requirements 
whose answer is a time period. Temporal reasoning task needs to logically infer behavior motive 
from video, such as time sequence between actions, action sequence in an activity or reasons why 
people in video do such an action. Questions must be designed according to information provided and

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We make the main claims clearly in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitation of this paper in Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the experimental setup in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

24


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: Code and benchmark would be released after submission and review. It does
include a new open-source benchmark.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details of training and testing are specified in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Experiments in this paper are conducted in multiple iterations, yielding stable
results. We reported the average of these results for consistency and reliability.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

25


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The computational cost and resources are specified in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in this paper conforms in every respect with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The Broader Impacts are discussed in Appendix F.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We follow the safeguards of base LLM Vicuna-7B v1.5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All models and datasets used in this paper have been properly credited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Benchmark would be released after submission and review. The paper does
provide well-structured details of the dataset.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
