Abstract

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused
primarily on scaling by increasing text-image pair data and enhancing LLMs to
improve performance on multimodal tasks. However, these scaling approaches are
computationally expensive and overlook the significance of efficiently improving
model capabilities from the vision side. Inspired by the successful applications
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in LLMs, which improves model scalability during
training while keeping inference costs similar to those of smaller models, we
propose CuMo, which incorporates Co-upcycled Top-K sparsely-gated Mixture-
of-experts blocks into both the vision encoder and the MLP connector, thereby
enhancing the multimodal LLMs with neglectable additional activated parameters
during inference. CuMo first pre-trains the MLP blocks and then initializes each
expert in the MoE block from the pre-trained MLP block during the visual instruc-
tion tuning stage, with auxiliary losses to ensure a balanced loading of experts.
CuMo outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs across various VQA and
visual-instruction-following benchmarks within each model size group, all while
training exclusively on open-sourced datasets.

Introduction

The advent of GPT-4V [53] has sparked excitement within open-source communities to transform
large language models (LLM) into multimodal LLMs. Recent multimodal LLMs [11, 46, 2] typically
integrate pre-trained vision encoders with MLP connectors to LLMs, with visual instruction tuning
data to fine-tune the pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their visual understanding capabilities. To further
scale up multimodal LLMs, previous efforts [44, 45, 39, 51, 7, 42] primarily focus on training the
model with a more extensive collection of text-image paired data and employing stronger LLMs,
significantly increasing training efforts. On the vision side, recent work concentrates on leveraging
multiple vision encoders [43, 18] to enrich visual content, employing larger vision encoders [9],
and using advanced vision-language connectors [5] to improve performance on multimodal tasks.
However, these techniques result in an increased number of additional parameters and generate extra
visual tokens for LLMs to process, making it inefficient to scale.

In terms of efficiently scaling up models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become the de-facto
framework in modern large-scale neural networks, particularly in natural language processing (NLP).
Most large language models (LLM) are built upon the transformer [64] architecture, wherein sparse

Initialization of Co-Upcycled MoE blocks in CuMo

Figure 1: Left: Each MLP expert within the MoE block during the visual instruction tuning stage
is initialized from the corresponding pre-trained MLP in CuMo. Right: CuMo outperforms strong
open-sourced models such as Mini-Gemini and LLaVA-NeXT, as well as the private MM1 model.

MoE is used to replace the dense MLP block with the Top-K sparsely-gated MoE block [57]. Recent
state-of-the-art open-sourced [28, 61] and private [55, 51] LLMs have predominantly adopted the
sparse MoE architecture. These models are scaled up using the MoE design during training while
maintaining relatively lower inference costs as only selected MLP experts are activated during the
feed-forward process. Nevertheless, the development and optimization of MoE-based models have
been largely tailored to LLMs, and the exploration of scaling multimodal LLMs with MoE, especially
on the vision side, remains largely unexplored.

Motivated by these observations, we introduce CuMo, which integrates Top-K sparsely-gated MoE
blocks into the vision encoder and the MLP connector of multimodal LLMs. We also explore the
associated training recipe and methodology for CuMo. Firstly, we pre-train the MLP connector
and perform pre-finetuning to warm up the whole model without introducing the MoE architecture,
which stabilizes the following visual instruction tuning stage with newly incorporated sparse MoE
blocks. Then, we replace each MLP block with the sparse MoE block in the MLP connector and
the vision encoder through co-upcycling. Each expert within the sparse MoE block is initialized
from the corresponding MLP block after the pre-training and the pre-finetuning stages, as shown in
Figure 1. Additionally, each MoE block contains a Top-K router trained from scratch to select experts
during the visual instruction tuning stage with auxiliary losses on the router to maintain a balanced
loading of experts. We conduct further comparisons between co-upcycled LLMs and pre-trained
MoE-based LLMs. The results show that the pre-trained MoE-based LLMs significantly outperform
the co-upcycled LLMs. As a result, the co-upcycling of LLMs is not included in CuMo. Our models
are trained fully on open-sourced datasets that are converted to visual instruction following formats.
Experimental results demonstrate that CuMo outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs on
various VQA and multimodal instruction-following benchmarks within the same model size group,
as illustrated in Figure 1.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We introduce CuMo, which integrates co-upcycled sparsely-gated MoE layers into both
the MLP connector and the vision encoder, enhancing the multimodal LLM with slightly
additional activated parameters from the vision side.

• We outline the training methodology for CuMo, including a three-stage training process
with auxiliary losses to stabilize training and ensure a balanced loading of experts.

• We train CuMo exclusively on open-sourced datasets and pre-trained models. It outperforms
state-of-the-art open-sourced and private multimodal LLMs across multiple competitive
benchmarks within each model size group.

Multimodal LLM

While the ultimate goal for mulitmodal models may be generative across various modalities [66, 3, 60],
modern multimodal LLMs primarily focus on integrating additional modalities, such as vision, into
LLMs. InstructBLIP [11] adopts Q-Former [37] to sample from visual tokens for LLM to feed-
forward and follow the instructions. Flamingo [1] and IDEFICS [23, 32] use shared decoder for
visual-language understanding. Qwen-VL [2] uses three-stage training to convert QwenLM to Qwen-
VL. LLaVA series [46, 44, 45] adopt visual instruction tuning that uses instruction-following data
to convert LLM into multimodal LLM. ShareGPT4V [7] collects detailed image caption data from
GPT4V to augment the LLaVA models. HoneyBee [5] investigates different designs of the MLP
connector for better alignment. VILA [42] unfreezes the LLM during pre-training with interleaved
image-text data. MoE-LLaVA [41] adopts the MoE design in small LLMs and reaches comparable
performance to LLaVA with large LLMs. VCoder [26] adopts various vision adapters to enhance
visual perception abilities. SPHINX [43, 18] adopts multiple visual encoders to enrich the visual
features with scaled data and models. InternLM-Xcomposer [69, 12] is trained with interleaved
text-image composition data and achieves state-of-the-art performance. InternVL [9] scales up the
vision encoder to a 6B ViT model. MM1 [51] summarizes the essential steps towards building a strong
multimodal LLM from a pre-trained LLM. Mini-Gemini [39] further collects guided generation into
the pipeline.

2.2
Mixture-of-Experts

Mixture-of-Experts [24] is proposed to utilize a set of expert networks to address specific tasks by
employing a gating network to determine the selection of these experts. Recently, it has gained
popularity in the design of large language models [15]. The mainstream practice [57] is to replace the
dense MLP layers with Top-K sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers in the transformer [64].
MoE in Language Subsequent works [33, 16] have further scaled up MoE-based large language
models with improved stability and load balancing of experts. The design of gating networks often
involves selecting the top-k experts for each token [57, 33]. Various routing strategies have been
explored, such as choosing top-k tokens by experts [71], one-to-one matching between experts and
tokens [34]. Besides routing strategies, maintaining the load balance of experts is crucial for training
MoE models. ST-MoE [73] adopts loading balancing loss and router-z loss to ensure a balanced
distribution of the experts. Upcycling [31] proposes training sparse experts from dense checkpoints
to stabilize training and lower the cost. Recent large language models like Gemini-Pro [55] and
DBRX [61] are also based on the MoE design.
MoE in Vision The success of MoE extends to the vision community, particularly following the
popularity of vision transformers [13, 4, 72, 21, 20, 25, 36]. V-MoE [56] reaches comparable
performance to dense ViT while only requiring half of the compute. LIMoE [52] replaces dense
MLP layers with MoE layers in CLIP and observes improvements in zero-shot image classification.
Residual MoE [65] corporates residual design into MoE transformer and saves over 30% training
cost. AdaMV-MoE [8] proposes an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task learning.

Method

In this section, we first review the sparse MoE block structure and the upcycling strategy utilized in
previous studies. Subsequently, we describe how these sparsely-gated MoE blocks are integrated into
each module of multimodal LLMs using co-upcycling strategies. Then, we introduce the three-stage
training process and auxiliary loss functions employed to stabilize training and balance the loads of
experts.

encoder and vision-language MLP connector, thereby improving the multimodal LLM capabilities
from the vision side. Skip connections are omitted for simplicity. Further implementation details are
provided in Section 3.2.

To scale up the model with multiple MLP blocks in parallel, a sparse MoE block includes a router
network to select Top-K experts out of S total experts. This router network has a linear layer to
compute the normalized weight matrix based on the inputs X for voting, resulting in

W = Softmax(Linear(X)) ∈RN×S
(2)

The Top-K experts are selected for each token based on W, and the re-normalized weights WK ∈
RN×K are computed using

WK = Softmax(TopK(W)) ∈RN×K
(3)

Each selected expert is represented by an MLP block, and the final output is obtained through a
re-weighted sum

Xout =

(4)

the output Xout maintains the same dimension as the output of a single dense MLP block.

Sparse Upcycling Training MoE-based designs from scratch can be unstable and costly. Sparse
Upcycling [31] addresses this challenge by initializing the experts in each MoE block from the
corresponding MLP block in pre-trained dense checkpoints. This initialization approach provides a
better starting point for training MoE-based models and reduces training costs compared to training
from scratch.

3.2
CuMo Architecture

Sparse MoE in MLP Connector The MLP connector converts visual tokens into word embedding
space, aligning dimensions between visual and text tokens. An effective architecture for the vision-
language connector is an MLP block [44] that contains two linear layers. We start from a single
MLP block and replace it with a Top-K sparse MoE block, incorporating a Top-K router and a set of
experts for projecting visual tokens into word embedding space.

Sparse MoE in Vision Encoder Vision encoders extract image features as sequences of visual tokens
for reasoning in LLMs. CLIP [54] is one the most popular pre-trained vision encoders for multimodal
LLM since it is pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, which makes it suitable for processing
images for multimodal usage. The visual encoding part of CLIP is a ViT [13] model, which has
consecutive MLP blocks in the transformer encoder. We substitute each MLP block with a Top-K
sparse MoE block, retaining skip connections alongside MoE block outputs.

Figure 3: Training Stages of CuMo. The first stage involves pre-training the MLP for better
alignment. Subsequently, the pre-finetuning stage trains all parameters as a warm-up before the
next stage. Finally, the MLP experts within each MoE block are initialized from the weights of the
corresponding MLP block, followed by training all parameters in the visual instruction tuning stage.

Sparse MoE in LLM In terms of using MoE in LLM, we compare the co-upcycled LLM with
pre-trained MoE-based LLM. We start from Mistral-7B and the upcycled Mistral-7B-MoE slightly
outperforms Mistral-7B on certain benchmarks. However, considering the constrained knowledge
base of upcycled experts from Mistral-7B, we compare it with the pre-trained Mixtral 8x7B with
pre-trained experts of a diverse knowledge base. Experimental results reveal that pre-trained Mixtral
8x7B significantly outperforms Mistral-7B-MoE. As a result, LLM is not co-upcycled with CLIP and
MLP connectors since it brings marginal improvements with great additional parameters.

3.3
Training Recipe

Co-Upcycling MoE blocks We start with training the added MoE blocks from scratch while the
model is struggling to converge. Attempts to address this issue with lower learning rates perform
worse compared to the baseline. As a result, we adopt a co-upcycling approach, initializing each
module that integrates sparsely-gated MoE blocks with pre-trained MLPs to replace corresponding
MLP blocks, as shown in Figure 1. This strategy consistently improves training stability and model
performance.

Three-Stage Training To further enhance training stability, we adopt a three-stage training strategy
for CuMo models, as illustrated in Figure 3. In the first stage, we only pre-train the MLP connector,
given that the vision encoder and LLM have already undergone pre-training on large-scale data.
During the second pre-finetuning stage, we train all parameters using high-quality caption data to
warm up the entire model before introducing MoE blocks in the subsequent stage. The third stage
involves visual instruction finetuning, where the multimodal LLM is scaled up with upcycled MoE
blocks and trained on visual instruction tuning data.

Loss Function To maintain a load balance between experts in each MoE block, we adopt auxiliary
losses based on the language modeling cross-entropy loss. The auxiliary losses comprise loading
balance loss and router z-loss [73]. Hence, the total loss is

L = Lce + αbLb + αzLz
(5)

Here, Lce represents the language modeling loss, which computes the cross-entropy of next-token
predictions. αb and αz denote coefficients for loading balance loss Lb and router z-loss Lz, set to
0.1 and 0.01, respectively, across all experiments. These auxiliary losses, abbreviated as bzloss in
Section 4, are individually applied to the MLP connector, vision encoder, and LLM for simplicity.

Experiments

We train the CuMo models on a mixture of open-sourced datasets, which are converted into the
visual instruction tuning format. Then, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of the performance of
CuMo models across various competitive VQA-based and instruction-following-based benchmarks.
Additionally, we perform ablation studies on each module with upcycled MoE blocks with qualitative
analysis of the results.

Implementation Details

Training Datasets During pre-training, we only utilize LLaVA-558K [46] to train the MLP con-
nector for better alignment. In the subsequent pre-finetuning stage, detailed image caption data
from ALLaVA [6] is employed to warm up all parameters of the multimodal LLM. For the final
visual instruction tuning stage, a mixture of datasets including LLaVA-665K [44], ShareGPT4V [7],
LAION-GPT-V [14], DocVQA [62], ChartQA [49], AI2D [29], InfoVQA [50], SynDog-EN [30],
ALLaVA [6], and LIMA [70] is utilized to train the CuMo models with upcycled MoE blocks. The
total data size for visual instruction tuning is approximately 1.65 million, and all training data are
publicly accessible. The detailed breakdown of the training dataset is listed in Appendix A.

Evaluation Benchmarks Evaluation of CuMo models primarily focuses on academic VQA-based
datasets such as VQAv2 [19], GQA [22], Science-QA [48], and TextVQA [59], as well as instruction-
following-based LMM benchmarks including POPE [40], MME [17], MMBench [47], SEED-
Bench [35], LLaVA-Wild [46], and MM-Vet [67]. Additionally, the challenging MMMU [68] is
evaluated to assess the visual reasoning abilities of the multimodal LLMs.

Training Settings We employ the pre-trained CLIP ViT-L [54] as the vision encoder, a two-layer
MLP as the vision-language connector, and Mistral-7B [27] as the LLM to establish the baseline
model following LLaVA v1.5 [44]. We only use LLaVA-558K [44] as pre-training data and LLaVA-
665K [44] as visual instruction tuning data to train the baseline model and make ablation studies
for comparisons. The learning rate is set to 1e-3 for pre-training the MLP connector and reduced
to 2e-5 for visual instruction tuning of both the MLP connector and CLIP. To further stabilize the
visual instruction tuning process after scaling up with additional data, the learning rate is lowered to
2e-6 for all parameters of the CuMo models in the final results. More hyperparameters of the training
process is listed in Appendix B.

Evaluation Settings During evaluation, we adhere to the settings outlined in the LLaVA series [44],
employing a greedy decoding strategy for all benchmarks. The data and questions are converted
into visual instructions to prompt the multimodal LLMs. For benchmarks that utilize GPT API for
evaluation, we adopt gpt-4-0613 for LLaVA-Wild [46].

Main Results

Comparison with SoTA Multimodal LLMs In Table 1, we present a comparison of CuMo models
with other state-of-the-art instruction-following-based multimodal LLMs. We categorize the models
based on the size of the base LLMs, including 7B models, 13B models, and 7B MoE models.
CuMo Mistral-7B outperforms other 7B-based state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs across multiple
benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of the CuMo Mistral-7B model is comparable to many
13B-based multimodal LLMs. In the case of Mixtral-8×7B models, CuMo achieves results on par
with SPHINX-MoE, MM1, and Mini-Gemini. LLaMA-based LLMs [10, 63] are not utilized in our
experiments due to license constraints.

Comparison under limited training data To further evaluate the effectiveness of the co-upcycled
MoE blocks, we train the vanilla CuMo mistral-7B under limited training data in Table 2. It shows
that CuMo outperforms other 7B models and reaches comparable performance to LLaVA-v1.5
Vicuna-13B under the same training data.

Ablation Study

Upcycle MLP connector to MLP-MoE We initiate the ablation study by replacing the MLP
connector with upcycled MLP-MoE, as depicted in Table 3(a). We start with a Top 2-in-4 router and
train the MoE blocks from scratch, which leads to a clear performance drop on all benchmarks. Then,
we adopt the upcycling strategy to initialize the MLP experts. We observe marginal improvements
over the baseline, considering each expert comprises only two linear layers. Subsequently, the
incorporation of bzloss to ensure a balanced loading of experts in the MLP-MoE yields noticeable
enhancements on MMVet. However, employing a Top 2-in-8 router with upcycling and bzloss results
in a slight performance decline, possibly due to the limited visual instruction tuning data to train
robust and well-balanced eight experts.

Empower CLIP with CLIP-MoE In Table 3(b), initially unfreezing CLIP based on MLP-MoE
leads to noticeable improvements on TextVQA and MMVet benchmarks. However, training with
the added Top2-in-4 MoE blocks in CLIP from scratch proves unsuccessful, as the model fails to
converge even with largely reduced learning rates. Consequently, adopting upcycled MoE blocks
during the visual instruction tuning stage yields further enhancements on the TextVQA, MMVet, and
SEED benchmarks, as well as a more stable training process.

Upcycle LLM vs Pre-trained LLM-MoE Upon replacing all MLP blocks with sparsely-gated
MoE blocks in the visual part, we further investigate the utilization of the MoE architecture in
the LLM. Starting from the Mistral-7B model, we first lower the learning rate to 2e-6 to set the
baseline and the following experiments since a learning rate of 2e-5 induces training instabilities.
Then, we upcycle each MLP block with a sparsely-gated MoE block, initializing the weight of each
expert from the pre-trained MLP block. As demonstrated in Table 3(c), the upcycled Mistral-4×7B
and 8×7B outperform the Mistral-7B model slightly except for TextVQA. However, considering
that the upcycled experts significantly increase parameters without introducing new knowledge, we
replace the upcycled Mistral 8×7B with Mixtral 8×7B [28]. In Mixtral 8×7B, all expert layers are
pre-trained on large-scale language data, providing superior initialization and similar training stability
compared to upcycling. The results indicate that CuMo Mixtral-8x7B outperforms its upcycled

loading of experts.

Multi-Resolution Visual Features Incorporating multi-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing the
understanding of image content in multimodal LLMs. Following the approach outlined in S2[58], we
introduce multi-resolution inputs to CLIP and concatenate the feature maps channel-wise to maintain
the total number of visual tokens consistent with low-resolution inputs. As illustrated in Table 3(d),
an empirical combination of 3× and 1× reaches the best performance and we adopt this configuration
for the final CuMo models.

Pre-FineTuning Stage Previous ablation studies were conducted directly after the pre-training of
the MLP connector, leading to observed training instabilities during visual instruction tuning. To
address this, we introduce a pre-finetuning stage using high-quality image caption data, wherein
all parameters are unfrozen. In Table 3(e), we leverage caption data from ALLaVA for this stage.
Results indicate that ALLaVA data proves to be a superior option, providing fewer but higher-quality
captions for training, ultimately leading to improved performance.

ence are evenly spread across layers, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of the auxiliary
losses in maintaining load balance.

Dialogue Comparisons Presented in Figure 5, we contrast the responses from CuMo-Mistral-
7B, LLaVA-Yi-34B, and MiniGemini-Yi-34B under challenging content understanding cases. It
demonstrates that CuMo-Mistral-7B can effectively follow instructions and provide mostly correct
answers to challenging questions derived from complex scenes. However, CuMo also exhibits
instances of hallucinations, such as responding with “2 characters standing on the table”, highlighting
the need for further investigation to mitigate hallucinations and improve reliability of CuMo.

Limitations The main limitation of CuMo is that, similarly to other large language models, it
can generate hallucinated responses. This may constrain its potentials in real-world multimodal
applications like used as a chatbot. Future works, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), can be undertaken to mitigate these
hallucinations and improve the model’s reliability.

Conclusion

In this study, we introduce the sparse mixture-of-experts design into multimodal LLMs from the
vision side. Specifically, we replace each MLP block with a Top-K sparse MoE block in the MLP
connector and the vision encoder. To enhance training stability, we employ a three-stage training
approach, incorporating upcycled MoE blocks during the visual instruction tuning stage, along with
auxiliary bzloss to maintain a balanced loading of experts. All CuMo models are trained and evaluated
on fully open-sourced datasets and benchmarks. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies,
we validate the effectiveness of the upcycled MoE blocks in each module. CuMo outperforms
state-of-the-art models across multiple competitive benchmarks within the same group of model
sizes.

Appendix

The supplementary material elaborates on further aspects of our work concerning the experimental
setups and dataset usage. In Appendix A, we provide details on the datasets used for the visual
instruction tuning stage and how we converted the mixture of datasets into the visual instruction
following formats. In Appendix B, we present the hyperparameters used for the three-stage trainings.
In Appendix E, we include additional examples of dialogues between the user and our CuMo models.

A
Dataset Details

As outlined in Table 4, we provide detailed information on the datasets utilized for the three-stage
training process mentioned in Section 3.3. All data are converted into the instruction-following
format for training. For the Syndog-EN and DVQA datasets, we didn’t use the entire training set as
we observed that a large portion of synthetic data negatively impacts the zero-shot performance of
the multimodal LLMs.

Experimental Setup Details

Table 6 provides an overview of the main hyperparameters used during the three-stage training
process. For the final results presented in Table 1, the model was trained using 32 × A100 GPUs
with a total batch size of 256 and a learning rate of 4e-6. All ablation studies were conducted with a
total batch size of 128 and learning rates of 2e-5 and 2e-6, as detailed in Section 4.3.

More Vision Encoders

Table 5 shows CuMo with different vision encoders. Here we use the pre-trained SigLIP-SO400M
as the vision encoder and add MoE to the vision encoder. SigLIP-SO400M has a much better
performance on ImageNet zero-shot classification than CLIP-ViT-L (83.2 vs 76.6). The added MoE
can still make improvements to this stronger vision encoder but the average improvement shrinks
compared to CLIP-ViT-L. However, the training data here is limited to LLaVA-665K for quick
verification, which may not show the full potential of the model if training with more data.

D
Model Parameters

We include Table 7 to illustrate the evolution of parameters in the CuMo model throughout its con-
struction process. The LLM constitutes a significant proportion of the total parameters, underscoring
the potential for further scaling up the vision encoders to bolster the strength of multimodal LLMs.

E
More Dialogues

We add more dialogues between the questions from the users and the response from CuMo-7B in
Figure 6.

F
Border Impact

The potential border impact of CuMo, as an open-sourced multimodal LLM, relies on two aspects:
the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the open-source community.

What car is  it  in this image

The car in the image is a Porsche Taycan, which is an electric vehicle produced by the German 

automobile manufacturer Porsche. The Taycan is known for its distinctive design elements that 
include the sloping roofline, the shape of the headlights, and the specific style of the wheels. The 
model name "Taycan" is visible on the front of the car, confirming its identity. This particular 

model is likely one of the higher-end versions, as indicated by the sporty design and the presence 
of what appears to be performance-oriented features.

What animals are in this image

The animals in this image are a cat and a dog. The cat is a domestic short-haired feline, 

identifiable by its tabby pattern and the shape of its ears and eyes. The dog is a Border Collie, 
recognizable by its distinctive black and white coat, medium-length fur, and the shape of its ears 
and eyes. Both animals are common domestic pets and are known for their companionship with 
humans.

Can you tell me what happened in this image

The image captures a moment where three individuals are standing beside a large piece of 

equipment, which appears to be a server or some form of industrial hardware. The presence of the 
yellow warning label suggests that the equipment is either new, being serviced, or requires caution 
when operating or moving. The setting seems to be a professional environment, possibly a data 

center or a technical facility, given the nature of the equipment and the clean, organized space. 
The individuals are dressed in casual to smart-casual attire, which might indicate a work-related 
context. The exact event or occasion is not clear from the image alone, but it could be a delivery, 
installation, or inspection of the equipment. The image does not provide any explicit information 

about the specific actions or events that took place prior to or after this moment.

How many characters in this image

There are seven characters in this image.

How many calories estimated in this bowl

Estimating the exact number of calories in a dish from a photograph is not possible without 
specific measurements and ingredient quantities. However, based on the visible ingredients and 

typical calorie counts for each, one could make an educated guess. A bowl of noodles with 
vegetables and a protein like chicken typically ranges from 300 to 500 calories. The addition of 

peanuts and sesame seeds would add a few dozen calories each. The sauce, which appears to be a 
light dressing, would contribute minimal calories. Therefore, a rough estimate might place this dish 
in the range of 400 to 600 calories, but this is a very rough estimate and could vary significantly 
based on the actual ingredients and portion sizes.

Figure 6: More dialogues of CuMo-7B. We highlight the correct answers and hallucinations from
the responses of CuMo.

AGI: The development of AGI is a core topic, with the central component being the LLM. A
multimodal LLM enhances its abilities to understand content such as images and videos, making it a
more versatile agent and a positive contributor towards AGI.

Open-sourced MLLM: Open-sourced weights and code can accelerate the development of MLLMs.
However, this also has potential negative impacts on society. Therefore, we have added a non-society
license to constrain the usage of our model.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We summarize our contributions and scope in the abstract and introduction
with the main experimental results to support our claims.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We add section 4.4 to discuss the limitations of our CuMo model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper is application oriented and we conduct extensive experiments to
validate our assumptions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all experimental details including the datasets, hyperparameters,
and training devices that we used.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all the open-sourced datasets and codes that we used for training
and evaluation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all the training and inference details for reproducing and under-
standing our results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For results with statistical variance like querying GPT API, we averaged the
results by three times to reduce the variance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

19


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the details of the compute resources settings to reproduce our
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We strictly follow the code of ethics during the project.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We add the discussions of border impact in Appendix F.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

20


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide usage guidelines for users to adhere when accessing to our model.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We strictly follow the original licenses of existing assets including datasets
and codes.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our models and codes are well documented for reproduction and protected by
licenses.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include crowdsourcing or human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include crowdsourcing or human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
