Abstract

This paper introduces OpenGaussian, a method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) capable of 3D point-level open vocabulary understanding. Our primary
motivation stems from observing that existing 3DGS-based open vocabulary meth-
ods mainly focus on 2D pixel-level parsing. These methods struggle with 3D
point-level tasks due to weak feature expressiveness and inaccurate 2D-3D feature
associations. To ensure robust feature presentation and 3D point-level under-
standing, we first employ SAM masks without cross-frame associations to train
instance features with 3D consistency. These features exhibit both intra-object
consistency and inter-object distinction. Then, we propose a two-stage code-
book to discretize these features from coarse to fine levels. At the coarse level,
we consider the positional information of 3D points to achieve location-based
clustering, which is then refined at the fine level. Finally, we introduce an instance-
level 3D-2D feature association method that links 3D points to 2D masks, which
are further associated with 2D CLIP features. Extensive experiments, includ-
ing open vocabulary-based 3D object selection, 3D point cloud understanding,
click-based 3D object selection, and ablation studies, demonstrate the effective-
ness of our proposed method. The source code is available at our project page

Introduction

The recently proposed neural rendering method 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [19] has rapidly gained
popularity and is being widely applied in various areas such as 3D reconstruction [18, 10, 38], 4D
reconstruction [23, 28, 42, 47], generation [41, 25, 49], and understanding [44, 51]. This is primarily
due to its fast training, real-time rendering capabilities, and explicit point-based representation.
Within the realm of 3D vision learning, 3D scene understanding has embraced the 3DGS framework
to achieve an integrated process encompassing explicit reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and
semantic understanding. Incorporating open vocabulary for 3D understanding is considered a more
promising, practical, and natural approach for intelligent agent understanding, interaction, and
decision-making. In this paper, we specifically concentrate on point-level open-vocabulary 3D scene
understanding based on the 3DGS framework.

Despite several efforts [33, 37, 52, 48, 54, 15, 24] to incorporate learnable language attributes into
3DGS, aiming to enhance them with language-grounded capabilities, the primary objective of these

approaches is to render language attributes onto images for 2D pixel-level understanding, lifting 2d
feature into view-consistent understanding/segmentation. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we demonstrate this
using an example involving the rendering of language-embedded 3D Gaussians into 2D feature maps
using LangSplat [33], followed by the utilization of open vocabulary for matching and identifying
target areas. While these methods exhibit impressive performance in view-consistent lifting, we
find a few drawbacks such as: 1) inability to recognize occluded objects or parts, compromising
the inherent 3D capabilities of 3DGS; 2) incompatibility with robotics and embodied intelligence
applications that necessitate 3D point-level understanding, localization, and interaction. Therefore,
we aim to empower 3DGS with the capability of 3D point-level open-vocabulary understanding.

We first investigate the 3D point-level understanding of existing works. As depicted in Fig 1(b), we
measure the similarity between textual features and 3D Gaussian language features, selecting points
with high relevance, and subsequently render these points through the rasterization module of 3DGS
to generate images. The results highlight challenges in effectively matching target objects, indicating
that although these approaches exhibit strong performance on 2D images, their 3D understanding
capabilities are limited. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, our visualization of their 3D point features reveals
a lack of discriminability between different objects and low consistency within objects. We attribute
these limitations to two main factors: 1) Weak feature expressiveness: Due to the memory and speed
constraints associated with 3D point-wise training and rendering in 3DGS, training high-dimensional
language features for millions of Gaussian points in a scene becomes challenging. As a result, existing
methods rely on dimension reduction techniques such as distillation [52, 8] or quantization [37] to
reduce dimensions. However, this inevitably compromises the expressiveness and distinguishability
of the features. 2) Inaccurate 2D-3D correspondence: The alpha-blending rendering technique
accumulates the values of 3D points based on opacity weights to render 2D pixels, which prevents
the establishment of a one-to-one correspondence between 2D and 3D. Consequently, a performance
mismatch occurs between 2D and 3D interpretations.

To address these challenges, we propose OpenGaussian, an approach that learns distinctive and
consistent features at the 3D point-level, both across objects and within objects. Our method associates
high-dimensional lossless CLIP [34] features with 3D Gaussian points, enabling open-vocabulary
3D scene understanding. Specifically, the technical contributions of this paper are summarized as:
1) Training of 3D point-level instance features that are both distinctive and 3D consistent using the
proposed intra-mask smoothing loss and inter-mask contrastive loss, leveraging boolean masks from
SAM [21] without cross-frame associations; 2) Introducing a two-level coarse-to-fine codebook to
discretize the instance features, resulting in discrete 3D instance clusters. 3) Proposing an instance-
level 2D-3D association method based on IoU and feature distance to associate CLIP features from

multiple views for each 3D instance. Through comprehensive experiments covering open-vocabulary
object selection at the 3D point level, open-vocabulary 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D
object selection, and module ablation, we demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of our method.
OpenGaussian eliminates the need for an additional network for feature dimensionality compression
or quantization while inheriting the open-vocabulary capabilities of the original CLIP features.

Neural Rendering

Neural 3D scene representation, for example, the recently proposed NeRF [29] has demonstrated re-
markable advancements in novel view synthesis quality using learning-based optimization techniques.
While many methods focus on improving NeRF’s rendering quality [2, 4, 3, 17], they often suffer
from slow training and rendering speeds. Alternatively, methods based on explicit representation,
such as voxels [39, 14, 35], hash grids [30] and point clouds [50, 1, 36], have emerged. These
methods employ techniques to reduce the computational cost of large neural networks. The recent
development of 3DGS [19] sets a new benchmark in terms of both rendering quality and rendering
speed by employing fast differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians instead of volume rendering. As
neural rendering proves to be an effective connection between 2D images and 3D scenes, our work
builds upon this paradigm with a particular focus on 3D point-level open-vocabulary understanding.

2.2
3D Open Vocabulary Understanding

Recent advancements in open vocabulary scene understanding have seen the integration of 2D Vision-
Language Models (VLMs) with 3D point cloud processing, resulting in significant progress in the
field [16, 45, 53]. These approaches primarily concentrate on aligning features and projecting 3D
data into 2D, thereby enhancing zero-shot learning capabilities. Furthermore, significant progress
has been made in 3D object detection and segmentation [11, 27, 40], demonstrating the efficacy of
merging point cloud data with visual features extracted from images for scene analysis.

The significant advancements in 2D scene understanding, pioneered by SAM [21] and its variants,
have motivated the exploration of integrating semantic features into NeRF. Methods have been
developed to incorporate semantic features from models such as CLIP [34] and DINO [7] into NeRF,
enabling more effective handling of 3D segmentation, understanding, and editing tasks. LERF [20]
distills features from readily available VLMs like CLIP into a 3D scene represented by NeRF. [26]
also introduces a 3D open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline using NeRF. Recent efforts have been
made to combine 2D scene understanding techniques with 3D Gaussians to create a real-time and
editable 3D scene representation, addressing the computational challenges of NeRF-based methods.

LEGaussians [37] introduces uncertainty and semantic feature attributes to each Gaussian, to render
a semantic map with corresponding uncertainties. This rendered map is compared with the quantized
CLIP and DINO dense features extracted from the ground truth image. LangSplat [33] uses a scene-
wise language autoencoder to learn language features on the scene-specific latent space, demonstrating
to discern clear boundaries between objects in rendered feature images. Feature3DGS [52] proposes
a parallel N-dimensional Gaussian rasterizer to distill high-dimensional features for view-based
tasks such as editing and segmentation. To achieve the 2D mask consistency across views, Gaussian
Grouping [48] performs simultaneous reconstruction and segmentation of open-world 3D objects,
guided by 2D mask predictions obtained from SAM and 3D spatial consistency constraints. Similar
to these works, we leverage the real-time rendering and explicit representation capabilities of 3DGS.
However, while those methods primarily focus on pixel-level open-vocabulary understanding (i.e.,
lifting 2D feature into view-consistent segmentation), our approach diverges as we aim to enhance
3DGS with the ability for 3D point-level open-vocabulary understanding.

harmonics coefficients for representing direction-aware color c. For a detailed description of the
splatting process, please refer to Appendix A.3, where a set of 3D Gaussian points is projected
onto 2D screen space and blended to generate pixels. Inspired from prior studies [33, 37, 52], we
augment each 3D Gaussian point with a low-dimensional feature f ∈R6 to represent its instance
attributes. However, our approach differs in two crucial aspects: 1) We do not require additional
dimensional reduction, quantization, or distillation for pre-trained features (such as CLIP [34],
SAM [21], DINO [7], and LSeg [22]) that widely used in previous literature [33, 52, 37, 8]; 2)
Instead of relying on tracking-based 2D methods for object counting in the scene [48], we exploit
the multi-view global consistency of the 3D Gaussians to constrain the instance features. We adhere
to the principle that Gaussian-rendered features from the same object should be close, while those
from different objects should be distant. To achieve this, we employ binary SAM masks (instead of
high-dimensional SAM features) without cross-view correlation to supervise the rendered instance
feature maps using two types of losses: intra-mask smoothing loss and inter-mask contrastive loss.

Given an arbitrary training view, we follow the splatting process to render the 3D instance fea-
tures f into a feature map M ∈R6×H×W by alpha-blending.
Given the i-th SAM mask
Bi ∈{0, 1}1×H×W , we can obtain the mean feature within the mask: ¯
M i = (Bi·M)/ P Bi ∈R6.
To ensure that features within each mask are close to their mean, we introduce the intra-mask smooth-
ing loss, which is defined as follows:

Ls =

where H and W represent the height and width of the image, respectively, while m corresponds to
the number of SAM masks in the current view. Additionally, we incorporate a constraint to promote
feature diversity among different instances, increasing the mean feature distance between masks.
This constraint is referred to as the inter-mask contrastive loss, and it can be described as follows:

where m represents the number of masks,

M j denote the mean features of two distinct
masks. By utilizing these strategies, we successfully obtain significant 3D cross-view consistency
and distinct instance features directly from masks, eliminating the need for cross-view correlation.

Two-Level Codebook for Discretization

Intuitively, the learned instance features appear well-suited for interactive 3D object segmentation.
For instance, by clicking on a pixel within the rendered feature map, we can retrieve Gaussians
with similar features to identify the selected object. However, practical implementation of this
approach poses challenges for the following reasons: 1) Setting a universal threshold to select similar

features proves to be difficult; 2) Since the feature map is rendered using alpha-blending, which
accumulates weights, it is inevitable for Gaussians from the same object to exhibit dissimilar features,
while Gaussians from different objects may share similar features. To enhance the distinctiveness of
instance features and improve interactivity for downstream tasks, we aim to ensure that Gaussians
from the same instance possess identical (not just similar) features by discretizing them. Inspired
by prior works on 3DGS compression [31, 12], we propose employing codebook discretization to
address this challenge. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the point features before discretization exhibit noise.

(1) Codebook for Discretization. Given the instance features F ∈Rn×6 for all n Gaussians, we
first randomly select k = 64 features from F to initialize the quantization codebook C ∈Rk×6. 1)
For each instance feature {f i}n
i=1, we find the closest quantized feature {cj}k
j=1 in the codebook C,
and store each Gaussian’s quantization index j in I ∈Rn×1. 2) In the forward process of feature
map rendering and loss calculation, cj replaces f i in computations. 3) During backpropagation, the
gradients of the quantized features are copied to the instance features (i.e. ∂Lp

∂f i = ∂Lp

∂cj , Lp is defined
in Eq. (4)), thus optimizing the instance features f i. 4) Subsequently, the quantization codebook C
is updated based on the indices I and F . Steps 1) to 4) are then repeated. Finally, we transform the
continuous instance features F into quantized features and indices {C, I}, achieving discretization
of instances in the scene.

However, this solution still presents challenges: 1) Due to occlusions or distance, two objects may
never share the same viewpoint and thus remain unoptimized by contrastive loss (i.e. Eq. (2)),
failing to ensure their features are distinct. 2) In large scenarios, a k value of 64 proves inadequate
for distinguishing all objects, reducing the distinctiveness of instance features. However, Simply
increasing k does not improve performance (will be demonstrated in experiments (Sec. 4.4)).

(2) Two-Level Codebook. We propose a two-level, coarse-to-fine codebook discretization to address
the above issues. Initially, we concatenate the instance features F with the 3D coordinates X ∈Rn×3
of the Gaussians for codebook construction, enabling position-dependent clustering. Subsequently,
we further discretize within each coarse cluster based only on the instance features. Therefore, this
approach not only avoids the issue of distantly located, non-co-visible objects being assigned to the
same one, but also breaks down large scenes, reducing the complexity of optimization. The process
can be mathematically expressed as:

F ∈Rn×6; X ∈Rn×3
7→{Ccoarse ∈Rk1×(6+3), Icoarse ∈{1, . . . , k1}n}
coarse, k1=64, 32
F ∈Rn×6 7→{Cfine ∈R(k1×k2)×6, Ifine ∈{1, . . . , k2}n}
fine, k2=10, 5
(3)
Finally,
we discretized the continuous instance features F
into a two-level codebook
{C, I}coarse, {C, I}fine. Notably, at the coarse level, the position of the Gaussians is used solely
for the codebook construction and is not involved in optimization, thus preserving the geometric
structure of the pre-trained Gaussian model. The visualization results of the two-level codebook can
be seen in Fig. 3(c) and (d).

(3) Pseudo Feature Loss. In the instance feature learning stage (Sec.3.1), supervision is limited
to boolean masks. However, during the current codebook construction stage, we have obtained
distinctive instance features that now serve as stronger supervision. Therefore, we can replace the
previous mask losses (Eq. (1), (2)) and clone the instance features from the first stage as pseudo

3.3
Instance-Level 2D-3D Association without Depth Test

Through the codebook discretization process described above, we enhance the ability to select 3D
objects via prompts such as clicking (will be demonstrated in Sec. 4.3). To further enable more
natural, open-vocabulary-based interactions, it is essential to associate 3D Gaussians with language
features effectively. In language-embedded 3D frameworks, there are two solutions: 1) Compressing
or distilling image features (already linked with linguistic features in the CLIP embedding space) into
a lower dimension to train 3D Gaussian semantic fields, which requires additional networks, training
steps, and potentially scene-specific encoder-decoders. Additionally, the compressed features may
blur the original semantics. 2) Establishing an association between 3D points and 2D pixels using
camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to map image features onto 3D points, but necessitates
depth information for occlusion testing [32].

We propose a simple yet efficient instance-level 3D-2D association method that retains high-
dimensional, lossless linguistic features while avoiding the need for depth-based occlusion testing.
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4, 1) we first render the features of a single 3D instance to the current
view, called “single-instance map” M i ∈R6×H×W (where i is the 3D instance index, ranging from
1 to k1 · k2), and then compute the Intersection over Union (IoU) with the current view’s “SAM mask”
Bj ∈{0, 1}1×H×W (where j is the mask index, ranging from 1 to the total masks.). Intuitively, the
SAM mask with the highest IoU is associated with this 3D instance. However, due to occlusions,
one “SAM mask” may intersect with a “single-instance map” rendered from multiple 3D instances,
which is why the previously mentioned pixel-to-point association method requires depth for occlusion
testing. 2) Our solution populates boolean-type “SAM mask”Bj with pseudo GT features, termed
“feature-filled mask” P j ∈R6×H×W , and then calculates the feature distance between P j and M j,
thus avoiding situations where IoU is high but the features do not correspond to the same object. In
other words, we propose a unified criterion of IoU and feature distance, which can be formulated as:

Sij = IoU(π(M i), Bj) · (1 −∥M i −P j∥1),
(5)

where Sij represents the score between the i-th 3D instance and the j-th SAM mask in the current
view. The first term calculates the IoU, with π(·) indicating the binarization operation; the second
term’s value is inversely proportional to the feature distance. Finally, the CLIP image features of the
mask with the highest score are associated with the Gaussians of the 3D instance, and the integration
of multi-view features is also considered.

Open-Vocabulary Object Selection in 3D Space

Settings. 1) Task: Given an open-vocabulary text query, we extract its text feature using CLIP and
calculate the cosine similarity between this feature and the language features of each Gaussian. Then,
we select the highly relevant 3D points and render them into multi-view images using the 3DGS
pipeline. 2) Baseline: We compared our method with LangSplat and LEGaussians. OpenGaussian
associates each Gaussian with a 512-dimensional CLIP feature using the method described in Sec. 3.3.
For LangSplat and LEGaussians, we followed their operation to reconstruct the 512-dimensional
CLIP feature from the low-dimensional language feature of each Gaussian. Note that our evaluations
all follow a consistent setup: we use text to find matching 3D Gaussians, which are then rendered into
multi-view images. Therefore, the metrics we report are inconsistent with the official metrics reported
by comparison methods. 3) Dataset and Metrics: We conducted experiments on the Lerf-ovs
dataset re-annotated by LangSplat. The average IoU and accuracy are calculated between the images
rendered from the 3D Gaussian points selected by the text query and the GT object masks.

Results. The quantitative results are shown in Tab. 1. The comparison methods exhibit poor 3D
understanding capabilities, meaning they struggle to accurately identify the 3D Gaussian points
relevant to the query text. We attribute this to the following reasons: 1) Weak feature discrimination.
Both LangSplat and LEGaussians compress high-dimensional CLIP features into low dimensions.
Although these are then reconstructed using a decoder, the transformation is not lossless, reducing the
distinctiveness between different semantic concepts and resulting in many similar features. 2) The
alpha-blending weighted accumulation rendering method cannot ensure a one-to-one correspondence
between 2D image features and 3D point features, causing their 3D point-level performance to fall
significantly short of their 2D pixel-level performance. Conversely, our method achieves superior
performance by addressing the two issues faced by the comparison methods: 1) We obtain distinctive
features through semantic-agnostic feature learning (Sec. 3.1) and two-level codebook discretization
(Sec. 3.1); 2) We avoid the learning burden of high-dimensional CLIP features and ensure lossless
features through training-free instance-level 2D-3D feature association (Sec. 3.3).

The visualization results are presented in Fig. 5. Given a query text, we can select the relevant
Gaussian points and render them into multi-view images. However, the comparison methods make

exhibit better discrimination.

Open-Vocabulary Point Cloud Understanding

Settings. 1) Task: Given a set of open-vocabulary text queries, we calculate the cosine similarity
between these text features and the Gaussian features. For each Gaussian, we select the text with the
highest similarity as its category, constituting the open-vocabulary point cloud understanding task. 2)
Baseline: The comparison methods are consistent with those in the last section, i.e. LangSplat and
LEGaussians. The high-dimensional feature reconstruction method for the Gaussian points is also
the same. 3) Dataset and Metrics: We conduct comparisons on the ScanNetv2 dataset [9], which
provides posed RGB images from video scans, as well as reconstructed point clouds and GT 3D
point-level semantic labels. Both our method and the comparison methods use the provided point
clouds for initialization. During training, we freeze the coordinates of the point clouds and disable
the densification process of 3DGS to ensure that the number and coordinates of the output point
clouds match those of the input/GT point clouds. We randomly selected 10 scenes for evaluation,
with training images extracted every 20 frames from the given video images. We use point cloud
mIoU and mAcc as evaluation metrics.

Results. Tab 2 shows the performance when using 19, 15, and 10 categories from the ScanNetv2
dataset as text queries. The dataset provides a total of 19 semantic categories (excluding “other furni-
ture”). Our method significantly outperforms the comparison methods. Notably, in our framework,

CLIP features are utilized in a zero-shot manner without any training, whereas in the comparison
methods, CLIP features are involved in learning Gaussian features. This highlights the low cost
and high efficiency of our approach. The performance of the comparison methods on the ScanNet
dataset is even lower than on the LeRF dataset (Tab 1). We attribute this mainly to the retention
of the densification operation of 3DGS on the LeRF dataset, which involves millions of points per
scene. In contrast, the point clouds provided by the ScanNet dataset are sparse, with approximately
one hundred thousand points per scene. This sparsity means that in ScanNet scenes, a single point
may need to represent the appearance of multiple pixels, exacerbating the issue of inconsistencies
between 2D and 3D features and leading to poorer performance. The results of point cloud feature
visualization on ScanNet are shown in the right two columns of Fig. 6. Our features exhibit better
instance-level discrimination.

4.3
Click-based 3D Object Selection

SAGA [8] shares a similar motivation with our approach, learning distilled SAM features to support
selecting 3D points associated with a 2D pixel clicked in the image. However, it lacks language-
grounded ability. In contrast, our method does not require supervision from SAM features and
can achieve click-based object selection using only the first two steps of our approach (Sec. 3.1,
Sec. 3.2). Given an image from any viewpoint, click a 2D pixel and select the related 3D Gaussian
points corresponding to that 2D pixel, then render them across multiple views. Unlike Sec. 4.1, where
the query is text, the input for this experiment is the pixel coordinates of the clicked point. In Fig. 7,
we compare our method with SAGA on the LERF dataset. The results show that our method can
segment more complete 3D objects. It is worth noting that SAGA employs post-processing methods
such as SAM mask, statistics, region growing, and ball query during inference.

4.4
Ablation Study

(1) Ablation of Intra-mask Smooth Loss and Inter-mask Contrastive Loss. To validate the
effectiveness of the two losses proposed in Sec. 3.1, we conducted the ablation shown in Tab. 3. i) The
inter-mask contrastive loss proves to be more crucial. Employing only this loss achieves respectable
performance. Adding the intra-mask loss further enhances results, leading to a 3.05% improvement
in mIoU and a 2.76% increase in mAcc. ii) The intra-mask smooth loss exhibits comparatively
lower importance, which can be attributed to the inherent characteristics of 3DGS, where a single
Gaussian point represents multiple pixels. Consequently, features of neighbouring pixels tend to be
similar, indicating that 3DGS naturally induces a smoothing effect on adjacent pixels. This intrinsic
smoothing mechanism partially mitigates the contribution of the intra-mask smooth loss.

(2) The Necessity of the Two-Level Codebook. i) In case #1 of Tab 5, a single-layer codebook with
k = 64 was initially employed, resulting in a limited 28% mIoU. The primary limitation arose from
the codebook’s capacity, which was insufficient to represent all objects in the scene. Increasing k to
320 in case #2 seemed like an intuitive solution, but it led to a significant decrease in performance.
Visualizations highlighted that solely constraining instance features resulted in spatially distant
points being grouped together within the same cluster. ii) To address this, we introduced a two-level
codebook approach. At the coarse level, we utilized both instance features and coordinates to ensure
spatial proximity of 3D points within clusters. Then, at the fine level, we further discretized instance
features. Notably, case #5 demonstrated substantial performance improvements with the two-level
codebook. In contrast, case #6, which employed a two-level design without incorporating coordinates
at the coarse level, underscored the positive impact of including coordinates. iii) To illustrate the
importance of considering both coordinates and the two-level codebook, we conducted experiments
with the case #3 and case #4 configurations, in which only position information was considered
without using the two-level codebook.

(3) The Strategy for 2D-3D Feature Association. In our instance-level 2D-3D feature association,
we assessed the IoU between 3D instance renderings and SAM masks, as well as the distance between
instance features and pseudo-features. Through an ablation study presented in Tab 4, we found
that each strategy can independently achieve comparable performance. Case #1 demonstrates the
effectiveness of our codebook discretization, enabling accurate 3D instance acquisition to support the
IoU-based association strategy. Case #2 highlights the discriminative power and global consistency
of our instance features, showing that feature-based matching alone can effectively associate objects.
Case #3 confirms that considering both strategies simultaneously yields the best performance. All the
ablations are evaluated on the semantic segmentation task of the 10 categories on ScanNet.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a 3DGS-based open vocabulary understanding method for 3D point-level
tasks. Existing methods excel at the pixel level but perform poorly at the 3D point level due to
learning lossy features and 2D-3D feature inconsistencies. We addressed this by training instance
features with 3D consistency using SAM masks and proposing a two-level codebook to discretize
these features, achieving intra-object consistency and inter-object distinction. Finally, we enabled
open vocabulary capability through lossless instance-level 2D–3D CLIP feature associations.

Limitations: (1) The geometric properties of the Gaussian (position, opacity, scale) are fixed. This
may lead to inconsistencies between geometric representation and semantic content. We will consider
joint optimization of instance features and geometric properties in future work. (2) The values of k
for the two-level codebooks are determined empirically. It is necessary to study scenario-specific
adaptive values to optimize performance across diverse contexts. (3) We focus on 3D point-level
understanding without considering the regression of object sizes to perform open-vocabulary 3D
detection tasks [27, 6, 5, 46]. (4) Currently, we have not considered dynamic factors, which are
common challenges in real-world applications. Integrating the proposed method with 4DGS [43, 13]
would be meaningful.

Appendix

A.1
Implementation Details

(1) Training Strategy. Consistent with LangSplat, we first pre-train the standard 3DGS for 30,000
steps. Subsequently, we freeze the Gaussian coordinates, scale, and opacity parameters, and train the
instance features for 10,000 steps (ScanNet is 20,000 steps) and the two-layer codebook for 30,000
steps (ScanNet is 40,000 steps). The 2D-3D feature association step is training-free. The extraction
methods for SAM masks and CLIP features also align with LangSplat. While LangSplat extracts
three layers of SAM masks (small, middle, and large), our implementation uses only one layer (large).

(2) Training Time. We train each scene on a single 32G V100 GPU (with actual memory usage around
16 to 20G). For the LERF dataset, each scene takes around 200 images and trains for approximately
50 minutes. For the ScanNet dataset, each scene takes around 100-300 images (Sample every 20
frames from the original data and downsample by 2), and trains for approximately 15 minutes. The
2D-3D feature association step is a one-time computation, and no further computation is needed
during inference. The association process takes around 1 minute.

(3) ScanNet Dataset Evaluation. We randomly selected 10 scenes from ScanNet for evaluation,
specifically: scene0000_00, scene0062_00, scene0070_00, scene0097_00, scene0140_00,
scene0200_00, scene0347_00, scene0400_00, scene0590_00, scene0645_00.
The 19 categories (defined by ScanNet) used for text query are respectively: wall, floor, cabinet,
bed, chair, sofa, table, door, window, bookshelf, picture, counter, desk, curtain,
refrigerator, shower curtain, toilet, sink, bathtub;
15 categories are without picture, refrigerator, showercurtain, bathtub;
10 categories are further without cabinet, counter, desk, curtain, sink.

(4) Hyperparameters. 1) The values of k in the two-level codebook. In the ScanNet dataset,
k1 = 64, k2 = 5 are used uniformly. In the LeRF dataset, for the teatime scene, k1 = 32, k2 = 10;
for the other scenes, k1 = 64, k2 = 10. 2) The weights of the coordinates in the coarse-level
codebook. In the ScanNet dataset, the weight is 1.0. In the LeRF dataset, the weight for the teatime
scene is 0.1, while for the other scenes, the weight is 0.5. 3) The weight of the intra-mask smoothing
loss. In the ramen scene of LeRF, the weight is 0.01; for the other scenes and ScanNet, the weight is
0.1.

Splatting 3D Gaussian Points

The 3D Gaussian point is formally defined as

G(x | µ, Σ) = e−1

2 (x−µ)T Σ−1(x−µ)
(6)

In the given equation, µ ∈R3 represents the spatial mean and Σ ∈R3×3 denotes the covariance ma-
trix. To ensure validity throughout the optimization process, the covariance matrix Σ is decomposed
into a scaling matrix S and a rotation matrix R as follows:

Σ = RSS⊤R⊤
(7)

During the rendering process, the 3D Gaussians are projected onto a 2D plane. With the intrinsic
matrix K and extrinsic matrix T , the 2D mean µ′ and covariance Σ′ are defined as follows:

µ′ = K[µ, 1]⊤,
Σ′ = JT ΣT ⊤J⊤
(8)

Here, J represents the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projective transformation. Each
Gaussian is associated with an opacity value o and a view-dependent color c, determined by a set of
spherical harmonics coefficients. The pixel color C is computed by performing alpha-blending on
the sorted 2D Gaussians, starting from the front and progressing toward the back.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the end part of our main paper, we discuss the limitations of this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: All the theorems, formulas in the paper are numbered and cross-referenced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This paper provides a detailed description of the method and training details.
We will release the code to replicate our results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our source code is not submitted as supplementary material but will be made
publicly available on our project page.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The details of training and testing are provided in A.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper reports information about the statistical significance of the experi-
ments, as shown in Sec. 4.1, and Sec. 4.2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

22


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The details of training and testing are provided in A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

23


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legal to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a
generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models
that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The models and data used in this paper are open-sourced and authorized.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
