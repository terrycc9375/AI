Abstract

Algorithms for playing in Stackelberg games have been deployed in real-world do-
mains including airport security, anti-poaching efforts, and cyber-crime prevention.
However, these algorithms often fail to take into consideration the additional infor-
mation available to each player (e.g. traffic patterns, weather conditions, network
congestion), which may significantly affect both players’ optimal strategies. We for-
malize such settings as Stackelberg games with side information, in which both play-
ers observe an external context before playing. The leader commits to a (context-
dependent) strategy, and the follower best-responds to both the leader’s strategy and
the context. We focus on the online setting in which a sequence of followers arrive
over time, and the context may change from round-to-round. In sharp contrast to the
non-contextual version, we show that it is impossible for the leader to achieve no-
regret in the full adversarial setting. Motivated by this result, we show that no-regret
learning is possible in two natural relaxations: the setting in which the sequence
of followers is chosen stochastically and the sequence of contexts is adversarial,
and the setting in which contexts are stochastic and follower types are adversarial.

Introduction

A Stackelberg game [30, 31] is a strategic interaction between two utility-maximizing players in
which one player (the leader) is able to commit to a (possibly mixed) strategy before the other
player (the follower) takes an action. While Stackelberg’s original formulation was used to model
economic competition between firms, Stackelberg games have been used to study a wide range of
topics in computing ranging from incentives in algorithmic decision-making [15] to radio spectrum
utilization [32]. Perhaps the most successful application of Stackelberg games to solve real-world
problems is in the field of security, where the analysis of Stackelberg security games has led to
new methods in domains such as passenger screening at airports [8], wildlife protection efforts in
conservation areas [10], the deployment of Federal Air Marshals on board commercial flights [18],
and patrol boat schedules for the United States Coast Guard [1].1

However in many real-world settings which are typically modeled as Stackelberg games, the payoffs
of the players often depend on additional contextual information which is not captured by the
Stackelberg game framework. For example, in airport security the severity of an attack (as well as the
“benefit” of a successful attack to the attacker) depends on factors such as the arrival and departure
city of a flight, the whether there are VIP passengers on board, and the amount of valuable cargo on
the aircraft. Additionally, there may be information in the time leading up to the attack attempt which
may help the security service determine the type of attack which is coming [17]. For instance, in
wildlife protection settings factors such as the weather and time of year may make certain species of

wildlife easier or harder to defend from poaching, and information such as the location of tire tracks
may provide context about which animals are being targeted. As a result, the optimal strategy of both
the leader and the follower may change significantly depending on the side information available.

Overview of our results. In order to capture the additional information that the leader and follower
may have at their disposal, we formalize such settings as Stackelberg games with side information.
Specifically, we consider a setting in which a leader interacts with a sequence of followers in an online
fashion. At each time-step, the leader gets to see payoff-relevant information about the current round
in the form of a context. After observing the context, the leader commits to a mixed strategy over a
finite set of actions, and the follower best-responds to both (1) the leader’s strategy and (2) the context
in order to maximize their utility. We allow the follower in each round to be one of K types. Each
follower type corresponds to a different mapping from contexts, leader strategies, and follower actions
to utilities. While the leader may observe the context before committing to their mixed strategy, they
do not get to observe the follower’s type until after the round is over. Under this setting, the goal of the
leader is to minimize their regret with respect to the best policy (i.e. the best mapping from contexts
to mixed strategies) in hindsight, with respect to the realized sequence of followers and contexts.

We show that in the fully adversarial setting (i.e. the setting in which both the sequence of contexts and
follower types is chosen by an adversary), no-regret learning is not possible, even when the policy class
is highly structured. We show this via a reduction from the problem of online linear thresholding, for
which it is known that no no-regret learning algorithm exists. Motivated by this impossibility result, we
study two natural relaxations: (1) a setting in which the sequence of contexts is chosen by an adversary
and the sequence of follower types is chosen stochastically, and (2) a setting in which the sequence
of contexts is chosen stochastically and the sequence of follower types is chosen by an adversary.

In the stochastic follower setting we show that the greedy algorithm (Algorithm 1), which estimates
the leader’s expected utility for the given context and plays the mixed strategy which maximizes their
estimate, achieves no-regret as long as the total variation distance between their estimate and the true
distribution is decreasing with time. We then show how to instantiate the leader’s estimation procedure
so that the regret of Algorithm 1 is O(min{K, Af}
p

T log(T)), where T is the time horizon, K is the
number of follower types, and Af is the number of follower actions. In the stochastic context setting,
we show the leader can obtain O(
p

KT log(T)+K) regret by playing Hedge over a finite set of poli-
cies (Algorithm 2). An important intermediate result in both settings is that it is (nearly) without loss of
generality to consider leader policies which map to a finite set of mixed strategies Ez, given context z.2

Next, we extend our algorithms for both types of adversary to the setting in which the leader does not
get to observe the follower’s type after each round, but instead only gets to observe their action. We
refer to this type of feedback as bandit feedback. Both of our extensions to bandit feedback make use
of the notion of a barycentric spanner [4], a special basis under which bounded loss estimators may be
obtained for all leader mixed strategies. In the bandit stochastic follower setting, we use the fact that in
addition to being bounded, a loss estimator constructed using a barycentric spanner has low variance,
in order to show that a natural extension of our greedy algorithm obtains ˜O(T 2/3) regret.We also make
use of barycentric spanners in the (bandit) stochastic context setting, albeit in a different way. Here,
our algorithm proceeds by splitting the time horizon into blocks, and using a barycentric spanner to es-
timate the leader’s utility from playing according to a set of special policies in each block. We then play
Hedge over these policies to obtain ˜O(T 2/3) leader regret.3 See Table 1 for a summary of our results.

Related work. Letchford et al. [21] consider the problem of learning the leader’s optimal mixed
strategy in the repeated Stackelberg game setting against a perfectly rational follower with an unknown
payoff matrix. Peng et al. [23] study the same setting as Letchford et al. [21]. They provide improved
rates and prove nearly-matching lower bounds. Learning algorithms to recover the leader’s optimal
mixed strategy have also been studied in Stackelberg security games [5, 7, 26, 6].

Our work builds off of several results established for online learning in (non-contextual) Stackelberg
games in Balcan et al. [5]. In particular, our results in Section 4.2 and Appendix C.2 may be viewed as
a generalization of their results to the setting in which the payoffs of both players depend on an external
context. Roughly speaking, Balcan et al. [5] show that it without loss to play Hedge over a finite set

2Specifically, a leader who is restricted to playing such policies incurs negligible additional regret.
3This is similar to how Balcan et al. [5] use barycentric spanners to obtain no-regret in the non-contextual
setting, although more care must be taken to handle the side information present in our setting.

of mixed strategies in order to obtain no-regret against an adversarially-chosen sequence of follower
types. In order to handle the additional side information available in our setting, we instead play Hedge
over a finite set of policies, each of which map to a finite set of (context-dependent) mixed strategies.
However, the discretization argument is more nuanced in our setting. In particular, it is not without
loss of generality to consider a finite set of policies. As a result, we need to bound the additional regret
incurred by the leader due to the discretization. More recent work on learning in Stackelberg games
provides improved regret rates in the full feedback [9] and bandit feedback [6] settings, and considers
the effects of non-myopic followers [13] and followers who respond to calibrated predictions [14].

Lauffer et al. [20] study a Stackelberg game setting in which there is an underlying (probabilistic)
state space which affects the leader’s rewards, and there is a single (unknown) follower type. In
contrast, we study a setting in which the sequence of follower types and/or contexts may be chosen
adversarially. Sessa et al. [25] study a repeated game setting in which the players receive additional
information (i.e. a context) at each round, much like in our setting. However, their focus is on
repeated normal-form games, which require different tools and techniques to analyze compared to the
repeated Stackelberg game setting we consider. Other work has also considered repeated normal-form
games which change over time in different ways. In particular, Zhang et al. [33], Anagnostides
et al. [3] study learning dynamics in time-varying game settings, and Harris et al. [16] study a
meta-learning setting in which the game being played changes after a fixed number of rounds.

Finally, our problem may be viewed is a special case of the contextual bandit setting with adversarially-
chosen utilities [28, 29, 24], where the learner gets to observe “extra information” in the form of the fol-
lower’s type (Section 4) or the follower’s action (Section 5). However, there is much to gain from tak-
ing advantage of the additional information and structure that is present in our setting. Besides having
generally worse regret rates, another reason not to use off-the-shelf adversarial contextual bandit algo-
rithms in our setting is that they typically require either (1) the learner to know the set of contexts they
will face beforehand (the transductive setting; Syrgkanis et al. [28, 29], Rakhlin and Sridharan [24]) or
(2) for there to exist a small set of contexts such that any two policies behave differently on at least one
context in the set (the small separator setting; Syrgkanis et al. [28]). We require no such assumptions.

Notation. We use [N] := {1, . . . , N} to denote the set of natural numbers up to and including
N ∈N and cl(P) to denote the closure of the set P. x[a] denotes the a-th component of vector x, and
∆(A) denotes the probability simplex over the set A. TV(p, q) = 1

R
|p(x) −q(x)|dx is the total
variation distance between distributions p and q, and Et[x] = E[x|Ft] is shorthand for the expected
value of the random variable x, conditioned on the filtration up to (but not including) time t. All
proofs may be found in the Appendix. Finally, while we present our results for general Stackelberg
games with side information, our results are readily applicable to the special case of Stackelberg
security games with side information.

Our setting. We consider a game between a leader and a sequence of followers. In each round t ∈[T],
Nature reveals a context zt ∈Z ⊆Rd to both players.4 The leader moves first by playing some
mixed strategy xt ∈X ⊆RA over a set of (finite) leader actions A, i.e., xt ∈∆(A). The size of A

valuable cargo, etc. In cyber-defense, zt may be a list of network traffic statistics.

is A := |A|. Having observed the leader’s mixed strategy, the follower best-responds to both xt and
zt by playing some action af ∈Af, where Af is the (finite) set of follower actions and Af := |Af|.

x is bf(z, x) ∈arg maxaf ∈Af
P

al∈A x[al] · uf(z, al, af), where uf : Z × A × Af →[0, 1] is
follower f’s utility function. In the case of ties, we assume that there is a fixed and known ordering
over actions which determines how the follower best-responds, i.e. if a > a′ for a, a′ ∈Af then the
follower will break ties between a and a′ in favor of a.5

We allow for the follower in round t (denoted by ft) to be one of K ≥1 follower types
{α(1), . . . , α(K)} (where K
≤T).
Follower type α(i) is characterized by utility function
uα(i) : Z × A × Af →[0, 1], i.e. given a context z, leader action al, and follower action af,
a follower of type α(i) would receive utility uα(i)(z, al, af). We assume that the set of all possible
follower types and their utility functions are known to the leader, but that the follower’s type at round
t is not revealed to the leader until after the round is over. We denote the leader’s utility function by u :
Z × A × Af →[0, 1] and assume it is known to the leader. We often use the shorthand u(z, x, af) =
P

al∈A x[al]·u(z, al, af) to denote the leader’s expected utility of playing mixed strategy x under con-
text z against follower action af. Follower ft’s expected utility uft(z, x, af) is defined analogously.

A leader policy π : Z →X is a (possibly random) mapping from contexts to mixed strategies. If the
leader using policy πt in round t and observes context zt, their strategy xt is given by xt ∼πt(zt).
Definition 2.2 (Optimal Policy). Given a sequence of followers f1, . . . , fT and contexts
z1, . . . , zT , the strategy given by the leader’s optimal-in-hindsight policy for context z is π∗(z) ∈
arg maxx∈X
PT
t=1 u(z, x, bft(z, x)) · 1{zt = z}.

We measure the leader’s performance against the optimal policy via the notion of contextual
Stackelberg regret (regret for short).

and
contexts
z1, . . . , zT ,
the
leader’s
contextual
Stackelberg
regret
is
R(T)
:=
PT
t=1 u(zt, π∗(zt), bft(zt, π∗(zt))) −u(zt, xt, bft(zt, xt)), where x1, . . . , xT is the sequence of
mixed strategies played by the leader.

If an algorithm achieves regret R(T) = o(T), we say that it is a no-regret algorithm. We consider
three ways in which Nature can select the sequence of contexts/followers:

1. If the sequence of contexts (resp. follower types) are drawn i.i.d. from some fixed distribution,
we say that the sequence of contexts (resp. follower types) are chosen stochastically.

2. If Nature chooses the sequence of contexts (resp. follower types) before the first round in order to
harm the leader (possibly using knowledge of the leader’s algorithm), we say that the sequence of
contexts (resp. follower types) are chosen by a non-adaptive adversary.

3. If Nature chooses context zt (resp. follower ft) before round t in order to harm the leader
(possibly using knowledge of the leader’s algorithm and the outcomes of the prior t −1 rounds),
we say that the sequence of contexts (resp. follower types) are chosen by an adaptive adversary.

Our impossibility results in Section 3 hold when both the sequence of contexts and the sequence of
follower types are chosen by either type of adversary. Our positive results in Section 4 hold when
either the sequence of contexts or the sequence of follower types are chosen by either type of adversary
(and the other sequence is chosen stochastically). Our extension to bandit feedback (Section 5, where
the leader only gets to observe the follower’s best-response instead of their type) holds whenever one
sequence is chosen by a non-adaptive adversary and the other sequence is chosen stochastically.

3
On the impossibility of fully adversarial no-regret learning

We begin with a negative result: no-regret learning is not possible in the setting of Section 2 if the
sequence of contexts and the sequence of followers is chosen by an adversary. While this is not
necessarily surprising given that Definition 2.3 allows for the optimal policy π∗to be arbitrarily

5It is without loss of generality to assume that the follower’s best-response is a pure strategy.

(1.) the learner observes a point ωt, (2.) the learner takes a guess gt, and (3.) the learner observes the
true label yt. Given a regret minimizer for our setting, we show how to use it in a black-box way (by
constructing functions h1, h2, h3) to achieve no-regret in the online linear thresholding problem.

complex, we show that this result holds even when the policy class to which π∗belongs is highly
structured. We show this via a reduction to the online linear thresholding problem, for which it is
known that no-regret learning is impossible.

Online linear thresholding. The online linear thresholding problem is a repeated two-player game
between a learner and an adversary. Before the first round, an adversary chooses a cutoff s ∈[0, 1]
which is unknown to the learner. In each round, the adversary chooses a point ωt ∈[0, 1] and reveals
it to the learner. ωt is assigned label yt = 1 if ωt > s and label yt = −1 otherwise. Given ωt,
the learner makes a guess gt ∈[0, 1] (the probability they place on yt = 1), and receives utility
uOLT(ωt, gt) = gt · 1{yt = 1} + (1 −gt) · 1{yt = −1}. The learner gets to observe yt after round
t is over. The learner’s policy πt : [0, 1] →[0, 1] is a mapping from points in [0, 1] to guesses in
[0, 1]. The optimal policy π∗makes guess π∗(ωt) = 1 if ωt > s and π∗(ωt) = 0 otherwise. The
learner’s regret after T rounds is given by ROLT(T) = T −PT
t=1 uOLT(ωt, gt), since the optimal
policy achieves utility 1 in every round. In order to prove a lower bound on contextual Stackelberg
regret in our setting, we make use of the following well-known lower bound on regret in the online
linear thresholding setting (see e.g. [12]).
Lemma 3.1. Any algorithm suffers regret ROLT(T) = Ω(T) in the online linear thresholding
problem when the sequence of points ω1, . . . , ωT is chosen by an adversary.

Theorem 3.2. If an adversary can choose both the sequence of contexts z1, . . . , zT and the sequence
of followers f1, . . . , fT , no algorithm can achieve better than Ω(T) contextual Stackelberg regret in
expectation over the internal randomness of the algorithm, even when π∗is restricted to come from
the set of linear thresholding functions.

The reduction from online linear thresholding proceeds by creating an instance of our setting such that
the sequence of contexts z1, . . . , zT correspond to the sequence of points ω1, . . . , ωT encountered
by the learner, and the sequence of follower types f1, . . . , fT correspond to the sequence of labels
y1, . . . , yT . We then show that a no-regret algorithm in the online thresholding problem can be ob-
tained by using an algorithm which minimizes contextual Stackelberg regret on the constructed game
instance as a black box. However this is a contradiction, since by Lemma 3.1 the online thresholding
problem is not online learnable by any algorithm. See Figure 1 for a visualization of our reduction.

Intuitively, this reduction works because the adversary can “hide” information about the follower’s
type ft in the context zt. However, there exists a family of problem instances in which learning this
relationship between contexts and follower types as hard as learning the threshold in the online linear
thresholding problem, for which no no-regret learning algorithm exists by Lemma 3.1.

Limiting the power of the adversary

Motivated by the impossibility result of Section 3, we study two natural relaxations of the fully adver-
sarial setting: one in which the sequence of followers is chosen stochastically but the contexts are cho-
sen adversarially (Section 4.1) and one in which the sequence of contexts is chosen stochastically but
followers are chosen adversarially (Section 4.2). In both settings we allow the adversary to be adaptive.

An important structural results for both Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 is that for any context z ∈Z,
the leader incurs only negligible regret by restricting themselves to policies which map to mixed

strategies in some finite (and computable) set Ez. In order to state this result formally, we need to
introduce the notion of a contextual best-response region, which is a generalization of the notion of a
best-response region in (non-contextual) Stackelberg games (e.g. [21, 5]).
Definition 4.1 (Contextual Follower Best-Response Region). For follower type α(i), follower action
af ∈Af, and context z ∈Z, let Xz(α(i), af) ⊆X denote the set of all leader mixed strategies such
that a follower of type α(i) best-responds to all x ∈Xz(α(i), af) by playing action af under context
z, i.e., Xz(α(i), af) = {x ∈X : bα(i)(z, x) = af}.

Definition 4.2 (Contextual Best-Response Region). For a given function σ : {α(1), . . . , α(K)} →Af,
let Xz(σ) denote the set of all leader mixed strategies such that under context z, a follower of type
α(i) plays action σ(α(i)) for all i ∈[K], i.e. Xz(σ) = ∩i∈[K]Xz(α(i), σ(α(i))).

For a fixed contextual best-response region Xz(σ), we refer to the corresponding σ as the best-
response function for region Xz(σ), as it maps each follower type to its best-response for every leader
strategy x ∈Xz(σ). We sometimes use σ(z,x) to refer to the best-response function associated with
mixed strategy x under context z, and we use Σz to refer to the set of all best-response functions
under context z. Note that |Σz| ≤AK
f for any context z ∈Z. This gives us an upper-bound on the
number of best-response regions for a given context.

One useful property of all contextual best-response regions is that they are convex and bounded
polytopes. To see this, observe that every contextual follower best-response region (and therefore
every contextual best-response region) is (1) a subset of ∆d and (2) the intersection of finitely-
many half-spaces. While every Xz(σ) is convex and bounded, it is not necessarily closed. If every
contextual best-response region were closed, it would be without loss of generality for the leader
to restrict themselves to the set of policies which map every context to an extreme point of some
contextual best-response region. In what follows, we show that the leader does not “lose too much”
(as measured by regret) by restricting themselves to policies which map to some approximate extreme
point of a contextual best-response region.
Definition 4.3 (δ-approximate extreme points). Fix a context z ∈Z and consider the set of all non-
empty contextual best-response regions. For δ > 0, Ez(δ) is the set of leader mixed strategies such that
for all best-response functions σ and any x ∈∆(Al) that is an extreme point of cl(Xz(σ)), x ∈Ez(δ)
if x ∈Xz(σ). Otherwise there is some x′ ∈Ez(δ) such that x′ ∈Xz(σ) and ∥x′ −x∥1 ≤δ.

Note that Definition 4.3 is constructive. We set δ = O( 1

T ) so that the additional regret from only
considering policies which map to points in ∪z∈ZEz(δ) is negligible. As a result, we use the
shorthand Ez := Ez(δ) throughout the sequel. The following lemma is a generalization of Lemma
4.3 in Balcan et al. [5] to our setting, and its proof uses similar techniques from convex analysis.
Lemma 4.4. For any sequence of followers f1, . . . fT and any leader policy π, there exists a policy
π(E) : Z →∪z∈ZEz that, when given context z, plays a mixed strategy in Ez and guarantees
that PT
t=1 u(zt, π(zt), bft(zt, π(zt))) −u(zt, π(E)(zt), bft(zt, π(E)(zt))) ≤1. Moreover, the same
result holds in expectation over any distribution over follower types F.

Since we do not restrict the context space to be finite, the leader cannot pre-compute Ez for every
z ∈Z before the game begins. Instead, they can compute Ezt in round t before they commit to their
mixed strategy. While Ezt is computatable, it may be exponentially large in Af and K. However this
is to be expected as Li et al. [22] show that in its general form, solving the non-contextual version
of the online Stackelberg game problem is NP-Hard.

4.1
Stochastic follower types and adversarial contexts

In this setting we allow the sequence of contexts to be chosen by an adversary, but we restrict the
sequence of followers to be sampled i.i.d. from some (unknown) distribution over follower types F.
When picking context zt, we allow the adversary to have knowledge of F and f1, . . . , ft−1, but not
ft. Under this relaxation, our measure of algorithm performance is expected contextual Stackelberg
regret, where the expectation is taken over the randomness in the distribution over follower types.
Definition 4.5 (Expected Contextual Stackelberg Regret). Given a distribution over followers F
and a sequence of contexts z1, . . . , zT , the leader’s expected contextual Stackeleberg regret is
E[R(T)] := Ef1,...,fT ∼F[PT
t=1 u(zt, π∗(zt), bft(zt, π∗(zt))) −u(zt, xt, bft(zt, xt))], where π∗is
the optimal policy given knowledge of z1, . . . , zT and F.

However, before instantiating Algorithm 1 with a specific estimation procedure, we provide a general
result which bounds the regret of Algorithm 1 in terms of the total variation distance between the
sequence {bpt}t∈[T ] and the true distribution p.
Theorem 4.6. Let p(z, x) := [p(bft(z, x) = af)]af ∈Af and bpt(z, x) := [bpt(bft(z, x) = af)]af ∈Af .
The expected contextual Stackelberg regret (Definition 4.5) of Algorithm 1 satisfies

E[R(T)] ≤1+2

T
X

t=1
Ef1,...,ft−1[TV(p(zt, π(E)(zt)), bpt(zt, π(E)(zt)))+TV(p(zt, πt(zt)), bpt(zt, πt(zt)))].

Theorem 4.6 shows that the regret of Algorithm 1 is proportional to how well it estimates p(z, x) over
time (as measured by total variation distance), on (1) the sequence of contexts chosen by the adversary
and (2) the sequence of mixed strategies played by Algorithm 1 and the (near-)optimal policy π(E).
While we instantiate Algorithm 1 in the setting where there are finitely-many follower types and
follower actions, Theorem 4.6 opens the door to provide meaningful regret guarantees in settings
in which there are infinitely-many follower types and/or follower actions.6 We now instantiate the
estimation procedure in Algorithm 1 in two different ways to get end-to-end regret guarantees. First,
the leader can get regret O(K√T log T) by estimating the distribution of follower types directly.

Corollary 4.7. If
bpt = {bpt(ft = α(i))}i∈[K], bpt+1(f = α(i)) = 1

t
Pt
τ=1 1{fτ = α(i)}, and
bp1(f = α(i)) = 1

K for i ∈[K], then the regret of Algorithm 1 satisfies E[R(T)] = O(K
p

T log(T)).

The leader can obtain a complementary regret bound of O(Af
√T log T) if they instead estimate the
probability that the follower best-responds with action af ∈Af, given a particular context z and
leader mixed strategy x.7 In what follows, we use 1(σ(z,x)=af ) ∈{0, 1}K to refer to the indicator
vector whose i-th component is 1{σ(z,x)(α(i)) = af}, i.e. the indicator that a follower of type α(i)
best-responds to context z and mixed strategy x by playing action af.
Corollary
4.8.
If
bpt(z, x)
=
{bpt(1(σ(z,x)=af ))}af ∈Af ,
bpt+1(1(σ(z,x)=a))
=

1
t
Pt
τ=1 1{bfτ (z, x) = a}, and bp1(1(σ(z,x)=a)) =
1
Af for af ∈Af, then the regret of Al-

gorithm 1 satisfies E[R(T)] = O(Af
p

T log(T)).

4.2
Stochastic contexts and adversarial follower types

We now consider the setting in which the sequence of contexts are drawn i.i.d. from some unknown
distribution P and the follower ft is chosen by an adversary with knowledge of P and z1, . . . , zt−1,

6All that is required to run Algorithm 1 in a particular problem instance is an oracle for evaluating
bEt[u(z, x, bft(z, x))] and updating bpt.
7In general K has no dependence on Af, and vice versa.

but not zt. As was the case in Section 4.1, we consider a relaxed notion of regret which compares the
performance of the leader to the best policy in expectation, although now the expectation is taken
with respect to the distribution over contexts P.
Definition 4.9 (Expected Contextual Stackelberg Regret, II). Given a distribution over contexts P
and a sequence of followers f1, . . . , fT , the leader’s expected contextual Stackeleberg regret is

E[R(T)] := Ez1,...,zT ∼P

" T
X

t=1
u(zt, π∗(zt), bft(zt, π∗(zt))) −u(zt, xt, bft(zt, xt))

#

,

where π∗is the optimal policy given knowledge of f1, . . . , fT and P.

Our key insight is that when the sequence of contexts is generated stochastically, to obtain no-regret
it suffices to (1) play a standard, off-the-shelf online learning algorithm (e.g. Hedge) over a finite
(albeit exponentially-large) set of policies in order to find one which is approximately optimal and
then (2) bound the resulting discretization error.
Lemma 4.10. When the sequence of contexts is determined stochastically, the expected utility of any
fixed policy π may be written as

Ez1,...,zT

t=1
u(zt, π(zt), bft(zt, π(zt)))

!

.

Using Lemma 4.10, we now show that it suffices to play Hedge over a finite set of policies Π in
order for the leader to obtain no-regret (Algorithm 2). The key step in our analysis is to show that
the discretization error is small for our chosen policy class Π.8 For a given weight vector ω ∈RK,
let π(ω)(z) := arg maxz∈Ez
PK
i=1 u(z, x, bα(i)(z, x)) · ω[i]. For a given set of weight vectors Ω, we
set Π to be the induced policy class, i.e. Π := {π(ω)}ω∈Ω.

Theorem 4.11. If Ω= {ω : ω ∈∆K, T · ω[i] ∈N, ∀i ∈[K]} and η =
q

log Π

T
, then Algorithm 2

obtains expected contextual Stackelberg regret (Definition 4.9) E[R(T)] = O
 √KT log T + K

.

We conclude by briefly comparing our results with those of the non-contextual Stackelberg game set-
ting of Balcan et al. [5]. In particular, the setting of this subsection may be viewed as a generalization
of the setting of Balcan et al. [5] in which the leader and follower utilities at time t also depend on
a stochastically-generated context zt. When |Z| = 1, we recover their setting exactly. Under their
non-contextual setting, there is only one set of approximate extreme points Ez, and so we write the
E = Ez. Here it suffices to consider the set of constant “policies” which always map to one of the
(approximate) extreme points in E. Plugging this choice of Π into Algorithm 2, we recover their
algorithm (and therefore also their regret rates) exactly.

However, it is also worth noting that more care must be taken to obtain regret guarantees against
an adaptive adversary in our setting compared to the non-contextual setting of Balcan et al. [5].9 In
particular, we need to bound the discretization error due to considering a finite set of policies, but it is
without loss of generality to consider a finite set of mixed strategies in the non-contextual setting.

8Interestingly, there is no discretization error if the sequence of follower types is chosen by a non-adaptive
adversary. To see this, one can repeat the proof of Lemma 4.10, using the fact that f1, . . . , fT is independent
from the realized draws z1, . . . , zT when the sequence of follower types is chosen by a non-adaptive adversary.
9Indeed, our notion of contextual Stackelberg regret is stronger than their non-contextual version of regret.

4.3
Simulations

We empirically evaluate the performance of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 on synthetically-generated
data. We consider a setup in which K = 5, A = Af = 3, and the context dimension d = 3. Utility
functions are linear in both the context and player actions, and are sampled u.a.r. from [−1, 1]3×3×3.

We compare the cumulative reward of our algorithms to each other and the algorithm of Balcan et al.
[5] (which does not leverage side information) as a baseline. We simulate non-stochastic context
arrivals in Figure 2a by displaying the same context for T/4 time-steps in a row. Follower types are
chosen u.a.r. from each of the five follower types. In Figure 2b, contexts are generated stochastically
by sampling each component u.a.r. from [−1, 1]. Followers are chosen non-stochastically by
deterministically cycling over the five types. In Figure 2c, both contexts and follower types are
chosen stochastically. Specifically, contexts are generated as in Figure 2b and follower types are
generated as in Figure 2a.

We find that Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 perform similarly across instances, and both significantly
out-perform the baseline of Balcan et al. [5].
It would be interesting to find instances for
which Algorithm 1 (resp. Algorithm 2) performs poorly whenever followers (resp. contexts) are
chosen non-stochastically.

5
Extension to bandit feedback

We have so far assumed that the leader gets to observe the follower’s type after each round. However
this assumption may not always hold in real-world Stackelberg game settings. For example, in cyber
security domains it may be hard to deduce the organization responsible for a failed cyber attack.
In wildlife protection, a very successful poacher may never be seen by the park rangers. Instead, the
leader may only be able to observe the action the follower takes at each round. Following previous
work on learning in non-contextual Stackelberg games, we refer to this type of feedback as bandit
feedback. What can we say about the leader’s ability to learn under bandit feedback when there
is side information?

While our impossibility result of Section 3 immediately applies to this more challenging setting, our
algorithms from Section 4 do not. This is because we can no longer compute quantities such as 1{ft =
α(i)} or bft(zt, x) for an arbitrary mixed strategy x from just follower ft’s action alone. We still
assume that the follower is one of K different types, although ft is now never revealed to the leader.

We allow ourselves two relaxations when designing learning algorithms which operate under bandit
feedback. First, while the leader’s utility function may still depend on the context zt, we assume
that the follower’s utility is a function of the leader’s mixed strategy xt alone, i.e. uf(z, x, af) =
uf(x, af) for all z ∈Z. This allows us to drop the dependence on zt from both the follower’s
best response and the set of approximate extreme points, i.e. bf(z, x) becomes bf(x) and Ez
becomes E. Furthermore, our definitions of contextual follower best-response region (Definition 4.1)
and contextual best-response region (Definition 4.2) collapse to their non-contextual counterparts.
Depending on the application domain, the assumption that only the leader’s utility depends on the side

9


---Page Break---
information may be reasonable. For instance, while an institution would prefer that a server with less
traffic is hacked compared to one with more, a hacker might only care about the information hosted
on the server (which may not be related to network traffic patterns). Second, we design algorithms
with regret guarantees which only hold against a non-adaptive adversary.10 Despite these relaxations,
the problem of learning under bandit feedback still remains challenging because of the exponentially
large size of E. While a natural first step is to estimate p(bft(x) = af) (i.e. the probability that
follower at round t best-responds with action af when the leader plays mixed strategy x) for all
x ∈E and af ∈Af, doing so naively would take exponentially-many rounds, due to the size of E.

Building off of results in the non-contextual setting of Balcan et al. [5], we leverage the fact that the
leader’s utility for different mixed strategies is not independent. Instead, they are linearly related
through the frequency of follower types which take a particular action, given a particular leader
mixed strategy. Therefore, it suffices to estimate this linear function (which can be done using as
few as K samples) to get an unbiased estimate of p(bft(x) = af) for any x ∈E and af ∈Af.
Borrowing from the literature on linear bandits, we use a barycentric spanner [4] to estimate
{{p(bft(x) = af)}af ∈Af }x∈E in both partial adversarial settings we consider. A barycentric spanner
for compact vector space W is a special basis such that any vector in W may be expressed as a linear
combination of elements in the basis, with each linear coefficient being in the range [−1, 1].

In Appendix C.1, we use the property that estimators constructed using barycentric spanners have
low variance to show that an explore-then-exploit algorithm achieves O(K2/3A2/3
f
T 2/3 log1/3 T)
expected contextual Stackelberg regret in the setting with stochastic follower types and adversarial
contexts. Specifically, our algorithm (Algorithm 3) plays a special set of K mixed strategies N times
each, then uses barycentric spanners to estimate {pt(1(σ(z,x)=af ))}af ∈Af for all x ∈X and z ∈Z,
after which Algorithm 3 plays greedily like in Section 4.1.

In Appendix C.2, we use the property that estimators constructed using barycentric span-
ners are bounded to design a reduction to our algorithm in Section 4.2 which achieves
O(KA1/3
f
T 2/3 log1/3 T) expected contextual Stackelberg regret whenever the sequence of contexts
is chosen stochastically and the sequence of follower types is chosen by an adversary. Finally, while
it may be possible to obtain O(
√

T) regret without using barycentric spanners, this would come at the
cost of a linear dependence on |E| (and therefore an exponential dependence on K and Af) in regret.

Conclusion

We initiate the study of Stackelberg games with side information, which despite the presence of side
information in many Stackelberg game settings, has not received attention from the community. We
focus on the online setting in which the leader faces a sequence of contexts and follower types. We
show that when both sequences are chosen adversarially, no-regret learning is not possible even for
highly structured policy classes. When either sequence is chosen stochastically, we obtain algorithms
with ˜O(
√

T) regret. We also explore an extension to bandit feedback, in which we obtain ˜O(T 2/3)
regret in both settings. There are several exciting avenues for future research; we highlight two below.

1. Intermediate forms of adversary. The two relaxations of the fully adversarial setting that we con-
sider, while natural, rule out the leader learning about the follower’s type from the context. Although
we prove that learning is impossible in the fully adversarial setting, our lower bound does not rule out,
e.g. settings where the mapping from contexts to follower types has finite Littlestone dimension. It
would be interesting to further explore this direction to pin down when no-regret learning is possible.

2. ˜O(T 1/2) regret under bandit feedback. Bernasconi et al. [6] obtain O(T 1/2) regret when
learning in non-contextual Stackelberg games under bandit feedback against an adversarially-chosen
sequence of follower types via a reduction to adversarial linear bandits.
However, applying
similar steps to Bernasconi et al. in our setting results in a reduction to a generalization of the
(adversarial) contextual bandit problem for which we are not aware of any regret minimizing
algorithm. Nevertheless, we view exploring whether ˜O(T 1/2) contextual Stackelberg regret is
possible under bandit feedback as a natural and exciting future direction.

10We hypothesize that our results in this section could be extended to hold against an adaptive adversary by
using more clever exploration strategies.

A
Appendix for Section 3: On the impossibility of fully adversarial no-regret
learning

Theorem 3.2. If an adversary can choose both the sequence of contexts z1, . . . , zT and the sequence
of followers f1, . . . , fT , no algorithm can achieve better than Ω(T) contextual Stackelberg regret in
expectation over the internal randomness of the algorithm, even when π∗is restricted to come from
the set of linear thresholding functions.

Proof. We proceed via proof by contradiction. Assume that there exists an algorithm ALG which
achieves o(T) contextual Stackelberg regret against an adversarially-chosen sequence of contexts and
follower types. Note that at every time-step, ALG takes as input a context zt and produces a mixed
strategy xt.

We now describe the family of contextual Stackelberg game instances we reduce to. Consider
the setting in which there are two follower types (α(1) and α(2)) and two leader/follower actions
(A = Af = {a1, a2}). Suppose that the context space is of the form Z = [0, 1], and that regardless
of the realized context or leader mixed strategy, the best-response of follower type α(1) is to play
action a1 (bα(1)(z, x) = a1, ∀z ∈Z, x ∈X) and the best-response of follower type α(2) is to play
action a2 (bα(2)(z, x) = a2, ∀z ∈Z, x ∈X). Since the follower’s best-response does not depend on
the leader’s mixed strategy or the context, we use the shorthand bft := bft(zt, xt). Finally, suppose
that the leader’s utility function is given by u(z, al, af) = 1{al = af}. Note that this is a special
case of our general setting (described in Section 2).

The reduction from online linear thresholding proceeds as follows. In each round t ∈[T],

1. Given a point ωt ∈[0, 1], we give the context zt = ωt as input to ALG.

2. In return, we receive mixed strategy xt ∈∆({a1, a2}) from ALG. We set gt = xt[1].11

3. Play according to gt, and receive label yt and utility uOLT(ωt, gt) from Nature. Give
follower type

ft =
α(1) if yt = 1
α(2) if yt = −1
and utility u(zt, xt, bft) = xt[1] · 1{bft = a1} + xt[2] · 1{bft = a2} as input to ALG.

Observe that under this reduction,

π∗(z) =
[1 0]⊤if z > s and
[0 1]⊤otherwise.
(2)

since if z > s, ft = α(1) and otherwise ft = α(0). By playing according to π∗, we can ensure that
u(zt, π∗(zt), bft) = 1 for all t ∈[T]. π∗must then be optimal, because 1 is the largest possible
per-round utility that the leader can receive.

Since ALG achieves no-contextual-Stackelberg-regret, we know by Definition 2.3 that

R(T) =

T
X

t=1
u(zt, π∗(zt), bft) −u(zt, xt, bft) = o(T).
(3)

To conclude, it suffices to show that ROLT(T) = o(T) using Equation (2) and Equation (3). Apply-
ing Equation (2), we see that

R(T) = T −

T
X

t=1
(xt[1] · 1{bft = a1} + xt[2] · 1{bft = a2}).
(4)

By construction, 1{bft = a1} = 1{yt = 1}, 1{bft = a2} = 1{yt = −1}, xt[1] = gt, and
xt[2] = 1 −gt. Substituting this into Equation (4), we see that

R(T) = T −

T
X

t=1
(gt · 1{yt = 1} + (1 −gt) · 1{yt = −1}) =: ROLT(T).
(5)

11Observe that xt[2] = 1 −gt.

14


---Page Break---
By Equation (3) and Equation (5), we can conclude that ROLT(T) = o(T). However, this is a
contradiction since no no-regret learning algorithm exists for the online linear thresholding problem
by Lemma 3.1. Therefore it must not be possible to achieve no-contextual-Stackelberg-regret
whenever the sequence of contexts and follower types is chosen by an adversary.

B
Appendix for Section 4: Limiting the power of the adversary

Lemma 4.4. For any sequence of followers f1, . . . fT and any leader policy π, there exists a policy
π(E) : Z →∪z∈ZEz that, when given context z, plays a mixed strategy in Ez and guarantees
that PT
t=1 u(zt, π(zt), bft(zt, π(zt))) −u(zt, π(E)(zt), bft(zt, π(E)(zt))) ≤1. Moreover, the same
result holds in expectation over any distribution over follower types F.

Proof. Observe that for any z,

π∗(z) := arg
max
x∈∆(Al)

T
X

t=1
1{zt = z}
X

al∈Al
x[al] · u(z, al, bft(z, x))

= arg
max
x∈∆(Al)

K
X

i=1

X

al∈Al
x[al] · u(z, al, bα(i)(z, x))

T
X

t=1
1{zt = z, ft = α(i)}

The solution to the above optimization may be obtained by first solving

xa1:K(z) = arg
max
x∈∆(Al)

K
X

i=1

X

al∈Al
x[al] · u(z, al, a(i)) ·

T
X

t=1
1{zt = z, ft = α(i)}

s.t. bα(i)(z, x) = a(i), ∀i ∈[K]
(6)
for every possible setting of a(1), . . . , a(K), and then taking the maximum of all feasible solutions.
Since Equation (6) is an optimization over contextual best-response region Xz(a(1), . . . , a(K)) and
all contextual best-response regions are convex polytopes, π∗(z) will be an extreme point of some
contextual best-response region, although it may not be attained. Overloading notation, let Xz(π∗(z))
denote the contextual best-response region corresponding to π∗(z), i.e., π∗(z) ∈Xz(π∗(z)). Since
for a fixed context z ∈Z the leader’s utility is a linear function of x over the convex polytope
Xz(π∗(z)), there exists a point x(z) ∈cl(Xz(π∗(z))) such that

T
X

t=1
u(z, x(z), bft(z, π∗(z))) · 1{zt = z} ≥

T
X

t=1
u(z, π∗(z), bft(z, π∗(z))) · 1{zt = z}.

Let x′(z) denote the corresponding point in Ez such that ∥x′(z) −x(z)∥1 ≤δ. (Such a point will
always exist by Definition 4.3.) Since u ∈[0, 1] and is linear in x for a fixed context and follower
best-response,

T
X

t=1
u(z, x′(z), bft(z, x′(z))) · 1{zt = z} =

T
X

t=1
u(z, x′(z), bft(z, π∗(z))) · 1{zt = z}

≥

T
X

t=1
(u(z, x(z), bft(z, π∗(z))) −δ) · 1{zt = z}

≥

T
X

t=1
(u(z, π∗(z), bft(z, π∗(z))) −δ) · 1{zt = z}

Summing over all unique z encountered by the algorithm over T time-steps, we obtain the desired
result for the policy π(E) which plays mixed strategy π(E)(z) = x′(z) when given context z. Finally,
observe that the same line of reasoning holds whenever we are interested in the optimal policy in
expectation with respect to some distribution F over followers, as is the case in, e.g. Section 4.1 (with
PT
t=1 1{zt = z, ft = α(i)} replaced with P(f = α(i))).

Section 4.1: Stochastic follower types and adversarial contexts

Theorem 4.6. Let p(z, x) := [p(bft(z, x) = af)]af ∈Af and bpt(z, x) := [bpt(bft(z, x) = af)]af ∈Af .
The expected contextual Stackelberg regret (Definition 4.5) of Algorithm 1 satisfies

E[R(T)] ≤1+2

T
X

t=1
Ef1,...,ft−1[TV(p(zt, π(E)(zt)), bpt(zt, π(E)(zt)))+TV(p(zt, πt(zt)), bpt(zt, πt(zt)))].

Proof of Theorem 4.6. For any z ∈Z and t ∈[T],

bEt[u(z, π(E)(z), bf(z, π(E)(z)))] ≤Et[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))]

+ bEt[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))] −Et[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))].

Since utilities are bounded in [0, 1] and the expectations Et and bEt are taken with respect to p and bpt
respectively, we can upper-bound bEt[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))] −Et[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))] by
Z
|dbpt(z, πt(z)) −dpt(z, πt(z))| = 2TV(p(z, πt(z)), bpt(z, πt(z))).

Putting everything together, we get that

bEt[u(z, π(E)(z), bf(z, π(E)(z)))] ≤Et[u(z, πt(z), bf(z, πt(z)))]+2TV(p(z, πt(z)), bpt(z, πt(z))).

We now use this fact to bound the expected regret. By Lemma 4.4,

E[R(T)] ≤1 +

T
X

t=1
Ef1,...,ft[u(zt, π(E)(zt), bft(zt, π(E)(zt))) −u(zt, πt(zt), bft(zt, πt(zt)))]

≤1 +

T
X

t=1
Ef1,...,ft−1[Et[u(zt, π(E)(zt), bft(zt, π(E)(zt)))]

−bEt[u(z, π(E)(z), bft(z, π(E)(z)))] + 2TV(p(z, πt(z)), bpt(z, πt(z)))].

By repeating the same steps as above, we can upper-bound

Et[u(zt, π(E)(zt), bf(zt, π(E)(zt)))] −bEt[u(z, π(E)(z), bf(z, π(E)(z)))]

by 2TV(p(zt, π(E)), bpt(zt, π(E))). This gets us the desired result.

Corollary 4.7. If
bpt = {bpt(ft = α(i))}i∈[K], bpt+1(f = α(i)) = 1

t
Pt
τ=1 1{fτ = α(i)}, and
bp1(f = α(i)) = 1

K for i ∈[K], then the regret of Algorithm 1 satisfies E[R(T)] = O(K

Section 4.2: Stochastic contexts and adversarial follower types

The following regret guarantee for Hedge is a well-known result. (See, e.g. Gupta [11].)

Lemma B.1. Hedge enjoys expected regret rate O(√T log n) when there are n actions, the learning

rate is chosen to be η =
q

log n

T , and the sequence of utilities for each arm are chosen by an
adversary.

Lemma 4.10. When the sequence of contexts is determined stochastically, the expected utility of any
fixed policy π may be written as

where the second line uses the fact that ft cannot depend on zt, and the result follows from the fact
that z1, . . . , zT are i.i.d.

Theorem 4.11. If Ω= {ω : ω ∈∆K, T · ω[i] ∈N, ∀i ∈[K]} and η =

Recall from Section 4.1 that 1(σ(x)=af ) ∈{0, 1}K is the indicator vector whose i-th component is
1{σ(x)(α(i)) = af}, i.e. the indicator that a follower of type α(i) best-responds to mixed strategy x
by playing action af. For any fixed policy π, we can write the sender’s expected utility in round t as

Eft [u(zt, π(zt), bft(π(zt)))] =
X

af ∈Af
u(zt, π(zt), af) · p(bf(π(zt)) = af)

=
X

af ∈Af
u(zt, π(zt), af) · p(1(σ(π(zt))=af ))

where p(bf(π(z)) = af) := Ef∼F[1{bf(z) = af}], the first line follows from the assumption of a
non-adaptive adversary, the second line follows from the fact that f1, . . . , fT are drawn i.i.d., and

p(bf(π(z)) = af) = p(1(σ(π(z))=af )) :=

K
X

i=1
1{bα(i)(π(z)) = af} · P(f = α(i)),

where P(f = α(i)) is the probability that follower f is of type α(i). Note that p(1(σ(π(zt))=af )) (and
therefore Eft[u(zt, π(zt), bft(π(zt)))]) is linear in 1(σ(π(zt))=af ).

Given this reformulation, a natural approach is to estimate p(1(σ(π(zt))=af )) as bp(1(σ(π(zt))=af )) and
act greedily with respect to our estimate, like we did in Section 4.1. To do so, we define the set
W := {1(σ=af ) | ∀af ∈Af, σ ∈Σ} and estimate p(b) for every element b in the barycentric
spanner B := {b(1), . . . , b(K)} of W.12

We estimate p(b) as follows: For every b ∈B, there must be a mixed strategy x(b) and follower
action a(b) such that b = 1(σx(b)=a(b)). Therefore, if the leader plays mixed strategy x(b) N times,

we set bp(b) =
1
N
P

t∈[N] 1{bft(x(b)) = a(b)}. Given estimates {bp(b)}b∈B, we can estimate
p(1(σ(x)=af )) for any x ∈E and af ∈Af as

bp(1(σ(x)=af )) :=

K
X

i=1
λi(1(σ(x)=af )) · bp(b(i)),

where λi(1(σ(x)=af )) ∈[−1, 1] for i ∈[K] are the coefficients from the barycentric spanner.13 Note
that this is an unbiased estimator, due to the fact that p(1(σ(x)=af )) is a linear function.

Algorithm 3 plays each mixed strategy x(b) for b ∈B N > 0 times in order to obtain an estimate
of each p(b).14 It then uses these estimates to construct estimates for all 1(σ(x)=af ) (and therefore
also Ef [u(z, x, bf(x))] for all x ∈E and z ∈Z). Finally, in the remaining rounds Algorithm 3 acts
greedily with respect to its estimate, much like in Algorithm 1.

Proof Sketch. The key step in our analysis is to show that for any best-response function σ ∈Σ and
follower action af ∈Af, Var(bp(1(σ=af ))) ≤K

N (Lemma C.3). Using this fact, we can bound the
cumulative total variation distance between bp(1(σ(xt)=af ) and p(1(σ(xt)=af )) for any sequence of
mixed strategies and follower actions in the “exploit” phase (Lemma C.5). The rest of the analysis
follows similarly to the proof of Corollary 4.7.

12See Section 6.3 of Balcan et al. [5] for details on how to compute this barycentric spanner.
13For more details, see Proposition 2.2 in Awerbuch and Kleinberg [4].
14In other words, we ignore the context in the “explore” rounds.

C.2
Stochastic contexts and adversarial follower types

We now turn our attention to learning under bandit feedback when the sequence of contexts is chosen
stochastically and the choice of follower type is adversarial. While we still use barycentric spanners
to estimate {{bp(1(σ(x)=af ))}af ∈Af }x∈E, we can no longer do all of our exploration “up front” like
in Appendix C.1 because the follower types are now adversarially chosen. Instead, we follow the
technique of Balcan et al. [5] and split the time horizon into Z consecutive, evenly-sized blocks.
In block Bτ, we pick a random time-step to estimate pτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))), i.e. the probability that a

follower in block Bτ best-responds to mixed strategy x(b) by playing action a(b), for every element
in our barycentric spanner B. If whenever the leader plays x(b) the follower best-responds with
action a(b), we set bpτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))) = 1. Otherwise we set bpτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))) = 0. Since the

time-step in which we play x(b) is chosen uniformly from all time-steps in Bτ, bpτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b)))
is an unbiased estimate of pτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))). While bpτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))) no longer has low variance
since it must be recomputed separately for every block Bτ, it is still bounded. Therefore, we can use
our estimates {bpτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b)))}b∈B, along with the corresponding linear coefficients from the
barycentric spanner, to get a bounded (and unbiased) estimate for every p(1(σ(x)=af )).

Once we have estimates for {{pτ(1(σ(x)=af ))}af ∈Af }x∈E, we proceed via a reduction to Algorithm 2.
In particular, in every block Bτ we use our estimates {{bpτ(1(σ(x)=af ))}af ∈Af }x∈E to construct
an (unbiased and bounded) estimate of the average utility for all policies in our finite policy class
Π during block Bτ. At the end of each block, we feed this estimate into the Hedge update step,
which updates the weights of all policies for the next block. Finally, when we are not exploring
(i.e. estimating pτ(1(σ(x(b))=a(b))) for some b ∈B), we sample the leader’s policy according to
the distribution over policies given by Hedge from the previous block. This process is summarized
in Algorithm 4.

Theorem C.2. If N = O(T 2/3A1/3
f
log1/3 T), then Algorithm 4 obtains expected contextual Stack-
elberg regret (Definition 4.9)

Proof Sketch. The analysis proceeds similarly to the analysis of Theorem 6.1 in Balcan et al. [5]. We
highlight the key differences here. The first key difference is that while Balcan et al. [5] play Hedge
over a finite set of leader strategies, we play Hedge over a finite set of leader policies, each of which
map to one of finitely-many leader strategies for a given context. Second, unlike in Balcan et al. [5] it
is not sufficient to only estimate {{pτ(1(σ(x)=af ))}af ∈Af }x∈E to obtain an unbiased estimate of the
utility of each policy in Π in each time block—we must also specify a context (or set of contexts)
to use in our estimator. We show that it suffices to select a context uniformly at random from the
contexts {zt}t∈Bτ encountered in the block.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

28


---Page Break---
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

29


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

30


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]
Justification: As our work is theoretical, there are no positive or negative societal impacts.
However, we hope that our work will one day lead to the design and implementation of
better algorithms for solving Stackelberg security games in practice, which would have a
positive societal impact in domains such as airport security and the protection of wildlife
against poaching.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

31


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

32


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
