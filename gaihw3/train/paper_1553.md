Abstract

Alignment is a procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We
have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance
the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false
facts (i.e., hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM align-
ment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination
in both alignment steps: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
(RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new or unfamiliar knowledge
can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human-
labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used
in standard RL often inadequately capture factuality and favor longer and more
detailed responses, which inadvertently promote hallucination. Based on these
observations, we propose FactuaLity-aware AlignMEnt (FLAME ), comprised of
factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimiza-
tion. Experiments show that our proposed FLAME guides LLMs to output more
factual responses while maintaining their instruction-following capability.

Introduction

Alignment [Ouyang et al., 2022] is a procedure to make pre-trained large language models
(LLMs) [Brown et al., 2020, Touvron et al., 2023] follow human instructions and serve as helpful AI
assistants. Despite significant progress in general LLM alignment [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai et al.,
2022, Yuan et al., 2024], state-of-the-art aligned LLMs are still prone to generate false claims [Ope-
nAI, 2023, Min et al., 2023]. In this work, we therefore attempt to advance the understanding of the
underlying causes of LLM hallucination as well as its relation to the alignment procedure.

We consider the commonly seen alignment process consisting of two training phases: (1) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) [Sanh et al., 2022]; (2) reinforcement learning (RL) with human [RLHF, Ouyang
et al., 2022, Bai et al., 2022] or automated feedback [RLAIF, Bai et al., 2023]. In our study, we find
that both the SFT and RL steps in the standard alignment process may actually encourage LLMs to
hallucinate. First, in the SFT stage, LLMs are fine-tuned with diverse instructions paired with human-
created high-quality responses. While this leads to strong instruction-following capability [Ouyang
et al., 2022, Köpf et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2023, Touvron et al., 2023], our study shows that such
human-labeled responses may present new or unknown information to the LLM. This, in turn, may
inadvertently promote hallucination. Second, we find that the standard reward used in the RL stage

often prefers longer and more detailed responses [Singhal et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2024b, Yuan et al.,
2024]. Consequently, a reward-hacking model ends up with a tendency to produce longer claims with
more non-factual information, as shown in the black dots in Figure 1. One possible reason is that
most existing RLHF or RLAIF approaches rely on a single scalar reward to represent preference,
which struggles to cover multiple alignment skill sets [Ye et al., 2024] and is likely to under-present
the aspect of factuality [Hosking et al., 2024].

To address the aforementioned issues, we study the key factors which impact factuality during
alignment. In particular, we first conduct a pilot study on the biography generation task [Min et al.,
2023] in a more controlled setting where the alignment process focuses solely on factuality (Section 3).
Our key observation is that an LLM hallucinates more if it is fine-tuned on new knowledge in either
the SFT or the RL stage. For example, an LLM becomes significantly less factual when fine-tuned
on responses produced by a model with access to external knowledge (e.g. a retrieval augmented
LLM), even though those responses are more factual themselves. Similarly, hallucination is greatly
increased if RLAIF is performed on preference pairs that consist of retrieval-augmented LLM output
as positive examples and the LLM’s own output as negative examples. In comparison, we discover
that fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a subset of its own generations selected by factuality yields
more factual responses and reduces hallucinations.

Next, we apply our findings to improve the factuality of the general LLM alignment process, which
is more challenging due to the diversity of instructions. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that
some instructions require factual responses while the others do not, and therefore would require
different alignment treatments. We first identify fact-based instructions that require factual responses
and leverage the findings in our pilot study to create additional training data at both SFT and RL
stages to explicitly guide LLMs to output factual responses. Specifically, at the SFT stage, for
fact-based instructions, instead of using human created seed training data, we elicit knowledge from
the pre-trained LLM and construct training data using its own pre-trained knowledge. This can
prevent fine-tuning the LLM on knowledge unknown to itself. At the RL stage, we create additional
preference pairs focused on factuality for fact-based instructions, which are combined with the
standard preference pairs for instruction following during Direct Preference Optimization [DPO;
Rafailov et al., 2023].

We evaluate models on Alpaca Eval [Dubois et al., 2024] and Biography, using win rate for instruction-
following capability and FACTSCORE [Min et al., 2023] for factuality evaluation. As shown in
Figure 1, using our FLAME
method (SFT + DPO ), a significantly higher FACTSCORE (+5.6
pts) is achieved compared to the standard alignment process (SFT + DPO), without sacrificing the
LLM’s instruction-following capability (51.2% win rate). Our ablation study also indicates that
identifying fact-based instructions is the key to factual alignment in the general alignment setting.

Related Work

Alignment.
Since pre-trained LLMs cannot accurately follow human instructions, a bunch of work
has been proposed to improve LLM alignment through SFT and RL. Some propose to improve SFT
through data curation [Zhou et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2024a], diverse instruction augmentation [Wang
et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2024] while others focus on RL with human feedback [Ouyang et al., 2022, Bai
et al., 2022], AI feedback [Bai et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2024, Yuan et al., 2024]. The main goal of these
alignment approaches is instruction-following capability (or helpfulness), which may guide LLMs to
output detailed and lengthy responses [Singhal et al., 2023] but inevitably encourage hallucination.

Factuality.
Prior work has highlighted the issue of hallucination in LLMs [Gao et al., 2022,
Kandpal et al., 2023, Mallen et al., 2023]. To address the issue, important research lines are factuality
evaluation [Min et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023b, Chern et al., 2023] and improvement. Some training-
free approaches to improve LLMs’ factuality include external knowledge augmentation [Gao et al.,
2022, Kandpal et al., 2023, Cheng et al., 2023, Jiang et al., 2023] and specialized decoding [Li et al.,
2023, Chuang et al., 2024].

Recent studies apply RL to improve LLMs’ factuality. For example, Tian et al. [2024] propose to
construct factuality preference pairs for direct preference optimization [DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023],
which is closely related to our work. However, they focus solely on enhancing LLMs’ factuality
through DPO but overlook its potential impact on the models’ instruction-following capability, as
demonstrated in our experiments. In contrast, our work provides a comprehensive examination
of improving LLMs’ factuality and instruction-following ability through fine-tuning approaches
encompassing both SFT and DPO. Concurrent to our work, Kang et al. [2024] find that LLMs
tend to hallucinate when facing unfamiliar queries. They consider improving LLMs’ factuality as
teaching LLMs to output abstaining or less detailed responses on such unfamiliar queries, a similar
behavior observed from our LLMs fine-tuned with FLAME (see case studies in Section 6.5). It is
worth mentioning that both prior studies focus on a simplified scenario as our pilot study in Section 3:
fine-tuning LLMs to improve factuality on a single task (e.g., fine-tuning and evaluating on biography
generation). In contrast, we consider the general alignment task, where LLMs are given diverse and
complex instructions.

A Pilot Study on Factual Alignment

In this section, we first study how to align large language models (LLMs) to be more factual. We use
biography generation as the task of our pilot study for two main reasons: (1) Biography generation is
a simplified setting where factuality is the sole focus of the alignment process. As we will discuss in
Section 4, studying factual alignment on diverse human instructions is more complex, as the alignment
process encompasses aspects beyond factuality, such as helpfulness and safety. (2) Evaluating the
factuality of biography generation is relatively easy since Wikipedia covers sufficient information for
public figures and most of the facts about a person are non-debatable [Min et al., 2023].

3.1
Alignment for Biography Generation

A standard alignment procedure consists of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
(RL). In this pilot study, our main goal is to teach LLMs to generate biography with reduced
misinformation. For the experiment, we compile training and evaluation datasets comprising 500
and 183 diverse human entities, respectively (further details provided in Appendix A.1). We employ
FACTSCORE [FS; Min et al., 2023] as the automated metric for assessing factuality, given its fine-
grained evaluation capabilities for long-form text generation and its strong correlation with human
judgments.3 To study factuality alignment in this pilot study, we posit that training data is needed
where the responses are more factual than the LLM’s own generations. Thus, we use retrieval-
augmented LLMs [RAG; Lewis et al., 2020] to generate training data, which has been shown to
output more factual responses [Mialon et al., 2023].

Throughout the paper, we refer to the pre-trained (PT), supervised fine-tuned (SFT), and direct
preference optimization (DPO) fine-tuned LLMs as PT, SFT, and DPO, respectively.4

4Note that in our experiments, we use DPO as the substitute of RL [Schulman et al., 2017].

SFT.
We explore two sources of supervision to generate training data (detailed in Appendix A.1):
(1) using PTRAG with few-shot demonstration to generate biographies for each name entity in training
data, where PTRAG is PT augmented with an off-the-shelf retriever [Lin et al., 2023]; (2) using
vanilla PT with few-shot demonstration to generate training data as a baseline. As shown in Table 1,
PTRAG is indeed much more factual than PT. However, a surprising discovery in the pilot study is
that fine-tuning on such more factual instruction–biography pairs generated by PTRAG results in a
less factual SFT model (row 4 vs 3).

DPO.
We further fine-tune the LLMs to be
more factual through DPO. An intuitive way to
create factuality preference pairs is to directly
use the samples from PTRAG and PT as positives
and negatives since PTRAG generates more fac-
tual biographies than PT (row 2 vs 1). Another
approach is to employ FACTSCORE (FS) as the
reward to select positive and negative samples
among the generations from PT itself [Tian et al.,
2024] (detailed in Appendix A.1). As shown in
Table 1, DPO fine-tuned on self-generated data
with FS reward guides models to generate more
factual responses (row 5 vs 3); however, DPO
fine-tuned with the supervision of PTRAG makes
the models hallucinate even more than its SFT counterpart (6 vs 4).

This outcome suggests that compelling models to generate responses akin to PTRAG prompts increases
hallucination. Conversely, fine-tuning LLMs on their own generations appears to be crucial for factual
alignment, a finding applicable to both SFT and DPO fine-tuning.

3.2
Strategies for Factual Alignment

From the pilot study, we find that better quality data (in terms of factuality) for SFT and DPO does
not necessarily yield models with better factual alignment. This is likely because the supervision from
RAG contains information unknown to the LLM; thus, fine-tuning on RAG generated responses may
inadvertently encourage the LLM to output unfamiliar information. To avoid unknown knowledge
from being presented to the LLM, a viable strategy is to create SFT and DPO training data using the
generated responses from the LLM itself.

Factuality-Aware Alignment

In the section, we further extend our discussion of factual alignment to encompass more general
instructions. Unlike biography generation in Section 3, where factuality is the main alignment
objective, human instructions are diverse and complex, necessitating a range of alignment skill
sets beyond factuality alone; e.g., logical thinking, problem handling and user alignment [Ye et al.,
2024]. Thus, conducting factual alignment with the diverse instructions face two main challenges:
(1) different instructions may demand distinct skill sets. For example, in Figure 2, instruction 3,
“Please give me a brief history of coffee”, necessitates factual accuracy and concise summarization,

while instruction 8, “Tell me a story about a pig who goes to the moon”, prioritizes creativity and
imagination over strict factuality. (2) As recent studies have emphasized [Ye et al., 2024, Hosking
et al., 2024], using a single scalar for reward modeling fails to adequately address multiple alignment
skill sets and often under-presents the aspect of factuality.

To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose factuality-aware alignment (FLAME ). To
address the first challenge, we propose to prompt LLMs to classify whether a given instruction
demands the response to be factual, as shown in Figure 2. We then apply the factuality fine-tuning
strategy for SFT and DPO discussed in Section 3.2 to those fact-based instructions. Furthermore, to
address the second challenge, we employ separate rewards to evaluate the factuality and instruction-
following capability of an LLM. For simplicity, our work only considers two alignment skill sets:
instruction following and factuality. We leave more comprehensive reward modeling to future work.

In the following, we first describe our baseline alignment approach and introduce our proposed
factuality-aware alignment built on top of the baseline alignment procedure.

4.1
Baseline Alignment

We initialize PT from Llama-2 70B pre-trained model5 and build our baseline alignment procedure
following self-rewarding language models [Yuan et al., 2024] due to its simplicity and independence
of other strong LLMs (e.g., GPT4) or human evaluators as a reward model. The alignment comprises
two steps: (1) building SFT model fine-tuned on a high-quality seed data consisting of 3,200
instructions and each instruction is paired with the best response created by humans from Open
Assistant dataset [OASST; Köpf et al., 2023]; (2) further fine-tuning SFT through DPO on instruction-
following preference data (x, y+, y−) constructed by itself (SFT) as the reward model, RMIF, where
y+ and y−are the positive and negative responses for a given prompt x, respectively. The resulting
fine-tuned model is denoted as SFT + DPO. Note that, following Yuan et al. [2024], we use
additional augmented 20K instructions to create the preference training data for DPO fine-tuning.
Further details are provided in Appendix A.3.

4.2
Our Approach

4.2.1
Factuality-Aware SFT (SFT )

Although leveraging human created high-quality seed data is a reasonable choice for SFT [Zhou
et al., 2023], our study in Section 3 suggests that fine-tuning on such high-quality data generated
by models other than the LLM itself may present unknown information to the LLM, which may in
turn encourage hallucination. To address the above issue, for each instruction from the seed data,
we elicit the knowledge from the pre-trained LM itself by generating the responses with a few-shot
demonstration. Furthermore, to better use the knowledge from both humans and the pre-trained
LLM itself, we propose to utilize human generated responses for non-fact-based instructions, while
leveraging the responses sampled from pre-trained LLMs for fact-based instructions to mitigate the
introduction of unknown knowledge.

Specifically, we create factuality-aware alignment training data for SFT with two steps. (1) Classifying
instructions: we first prompt SFT to judge whether an instruction from the seed data is fact-based (x ∈
Xfact) or not.6 (2) Eliciting knowledge from PT: as illustrated in Figure 3(a), we sample 10 responses
from PT with 5-shot demonstration, (x0, Human(x0)) · · · (x4, Human(x4)), where xk is the top-k
similar instruction to x retrieved by DRAGON+ [Lin et al., 2023] from the seed data. Human(xk)
denotes the corresponding human response to xk in the seed data. As illustrated in Figure 3(b)
(upper), the resulting training data for SFT is (x /∈Xfact, Human(x)), (x ∈Xfact, PT(x)), where
PT(x) denotes the set of responses to x sampled from PT. The fine-tuned model is denoted as SFT .

4.2.2
Factuality-Aware DPO (DPO )

At the second stage of alignment with DPO, we use SFT to generate multiple responses y0, y1, · · ·
for a given instruction x; then, using SFT itself as the reward model (RMIF) to create a preference
pair: (x, y+, y−).7 The above data creation procedure is the same as the second stage of our baseline
alignment in Section 4.1. However, recent studies [Saha et al., 2024, Hosking et al., 2024, Ye
et al., 2024] indicate that a single scalar reward from human feedback or LLM reward models may
underrepresent the aspect of factuality. To address this limitation, we introduce another factuality
reward model (RMfact) to evaluate factuality of responses and create a factuality preference pair for
fact-based instructions: (x ∈Xfact, ytrue, yfalse).

Specifically, we build RMfact with retrieval augmentation to measure the percentage of facts in a
response that are correct. RMfact comprises two main components: atomic fact decomposition and
retrieval augmented claim verification. We detail the components and ablate their impacts on the
quality of RMfact in Appendix A.5. We compute factuality reward for the same responses sampled
from SFT : RMfact(x, y0), RMfact(x, y1), · · · . The response with the highest (lowest) factuality
reward is chosen as ytrue (yfalse). Note that if the chosen paired responses show large difference in
instruction-following reward, we discard the pair; i.e., |RMIF(x, ytrue) −RMIF(x, yfalse)| > 0.5. As
illustrated in Figure 3(b) (lower), in factuality-aware DPO training, the model is initialized from SFT
and the fine-tuned model is our final factuality-aware aligned model, denoted SFT + DPO . The
specific procedures for fine-tuning models in both the SFT and DPO are described in Appendix A.6.

Experiments

5.1
Evaluation Datasets and Metrics

Instruction Following.
We use the 805 instruction-following tasks from Alpaca Eval [Dubois et al.,
2024] to evaluate models head-to-head win rate against our baselines using the recommended evalua-
tor: alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn. We use SFT and SFT + DPO described in Section 4.1
as the baselines for win rate comparisons.

Factuality.
We evaluate models on three datasets with diverse knowledge-intensive instructions for
factuality. (1) Biography: a knowledge insensitive sub-task of instruction-following tasks. Following
our pilot study in Section 3, we use the 183 human entities provided by Min et al. [2023] with the
prompt “Tell me a bio of entity name”. (2) Alpaca Fact: we extract the fact-based instructions
from the 803 instructions using our SFT model (with the prompt shown in Appendix Figure 4), re-
sulting in 241 instructions. (3) FAVA [Mishra et al., 2024]8: the 141 knowledge-intensive instructions
from multiple sources, including Open Assistant [Köpf et al., 2023], No Robots [Rajani et al., 2023],
WebNLG [Gardent et al., 2017] and manually created datasets. We report FACTSCORE (FS) without
length penalty as the metric for all the three datasets. Note that original FS computes proportion of
correct facts with additional penalty on short generations with less than 10 atomic facts. This penalty
aims to address situations where models provide insufficiently detailed answers. We assume that this
aspect is considered in the evaluation of instruction following in Alpaca Eval. In addition, we also

report the number of correct and erroneous facts. All the numbers reported are averaged over the
instructions in each dataset.

In addition, we also evaluate our fine-tuned models’ truthfulness using TruthfulQA [Lin et al.,
2022]. We evaluate model performance in the generation task and use ROUGE [Lin, 2004] and
BLEU [Papineni et al., 2002] to measure the quality of responses.

5.2
Comparisons of SFT

Table 2 compares the pre-trained Llama-2 70B fine-tuned on OASST dataset with responses from
different sources. We list the FACTSCORE (FS) of biography generation using the pre-trained model
through Bio 5-shot demonstration as reference (row 0) and SFT, which is fine-tuned on our seed data
with human-created responses, is our baseline (row 1). We first notice that SFT shows significant
FACTSCORE degradation (53.1 vs 44.7) compared to Bio 5-shot with the pre-trained model. It seems
that SFT tends to generate more lengthy responses but with more erroneous facts.

When eliciting the knowledge from PT by fine-tuning on its own generated responses, SFTfact gener-
ates more factual responses in Biography and Alpaca (row 2 vs 1). However, it shows slightly inferior
instruction-following capability in Alpaca Eval. This result demonstrates that human responses indeed
teach LLMs how to better follow instructions but also encourage LLMs to output more false facts. On
the other hand, eliciting the knowledge from the pre-trained model itself avoids the encouragement
of hallucination albeit with a slight reduction in instruction-following capability. Finally, SFT
combining supervision from humans and PT, shows comparable instruction-following capability and
output more factual responses on fact-based instructions (row 3 vs 1).

5.3
Comparisons of DPO

Table 3 compares different DPO training recipes. First, we conduct DPO fine-tuning on our SFT
baseline, SFT. When further aligning the model to follow instructions, DPO sees a significant
improvement in instruction-following capability (row 2 vs 1) with win rate 72.9 over SFT; however,
the instruction aligned model tends to output lengthy responses with more factual errors (see examples
in Appendix Figure 10). On the other hand, when only aligned with factual preference data, DPOfact

shows less improvement in instruction-following capability (row 1 vs 3). These results indicate that

7


---Page Break---
preference optimization for either instruction following or factuality alone may come at the expense
of the other since the former encourages models to output long and detailed responses while the
later discourages models to output false claims. When jointly conducting instruction and factuality
alignment, DPO not only better follows instructions but also outputs more factual responses (row
4 vs 1, 2). Finally, initializing from SFT , the DPO fine-tuned models are more factual than their
counterparts (i.e., 6 vs 2 and 7 vs 4) without instruction-following capability degrade. We also list the
results from Llama-2-Chat 70B (row 0) and observe that despite of its strong instruction-following
capability, it tends to output many more incorrect facts. These results demonstrate that standard
alignment, even on proprietary commercial data, may encourage LLMs to hallucinate. In contrast,
our factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses without degradation in
their general instruction-following capabilities.

It is worth noting that SFTfact and DPOfact are similar to SFT and DPO fine-tuning proposed by
Tian et al. [2024], which improve LLMs’ factuality but degrade their instruction-following capability.
Also, we do not observe our SFT and DPO variants outperform the pre-trained model with few-shot
demonstrations on biography generation (row 0 in Table 2. This is possibly due to the alignment
tax found in previous work [Ouyang et al., 2022], which degrades LLMs’ accuracy on the standard
knowledge benchmarks. How to improve both models’ instruction-following capability and their
accuracy on standard knowledge benchmarks is worth exploring, which we leave for future work.

Table 4 compares models performance on Truth-
fulQA. Generally, we observe that our factuality-
aware alignment training guides LLMs to output
more truthful responses. For example, factuality-
aware SFT improves LLMs’ truthfulness (row 5
vs 1). In addition, DPO fine-tuning on the factual-
ity preference data guides LLMs to output more
truthful responses (rows 3,4 vs 2 and 7 vs 6).
Note that we observe that SFT and DPO models
show a reverse trend in BLUE and ROUGE. This
is likely because SFT models tend to generate
shorter responses than the DPO ones do.

In addition, Table 5 reports models’ accuracy
in tasks of multiple choices from TruthfulQA.
No significant differences between models
are observed. This is possibly because we
mainly focus on the tasks of long-form re-
sponse generation while TruthfulQA-MC
task is formed by short-form answers. The
discrepancy between improving LLMs’ factu-
ality on long-form and short-form generation
is also found by the previous work [Chuang
et al., 2024]. Appendix Table 9 reports more
evaluation results on other NLP benchmarks.

Discussion

6.1
Effects of Fact-Based Instruction Classification

In our factuality-aware alignment, we prompt SFT to judge whether an instruction requires a factual
response and apply our factuality alignment strategy to the fact-based instruction. Without the
instruction classification, in our factuality-aware SFT, we cannot create supervision from Human and
PT responses for respective non-fact-based and fact-based instructions. Instead, for each instruction,
we create instruction–response pairs from 1 and 10 responses from Human and PT as supervisions,
respectively. Note that, during fine-tuning, for each instruction, we randomly sample instruction–
response pair either created from Human or PT with same probability. The SFT model shows

8


---Page Break---
degradation in both instruction-following capability and factuality results, as shown in row 1 vs 2 of
Table 6. Second, for factuality-aware DPO, without the instruction classification, we create factuality
preference pairs from all instructions instead of fact-based instructions. The DPO fine-tuned model
outputs slightly more factual responses but sacrifice instruction-following capability, as shown in row
3 vs 4 of Table 6.

In addition, we observe that not all the sentences
in a response to a fact-based instruction require
fact check. For example, given the response, “Of
course. The Commodore 64 is a 8-bit home com-
puter that was released by Commodore Interna-
tional in August 1982.”, conducting fact check
for the first sentence “Of course.” is not necessary
and may make the factuality reward less accurate.
To address this issue, we prompt SFT to judge
whether each sentence in a response required fact
check using the prompt in Appendix Figure 6.
We only conduct fact check and compute factu-
ality rewards for those fact-based sentences. However, as shown in Table 6, computing factuality
rewards for fact-based sentences makes our factual alignment less effective (row 5 vs 4). This is
likely because the fact-based sentence classifier is not accurate enough and brings noise into our
factuality reward model (see examples in Appendix Figure 7).

△comparing with DPO baseline, SFT + DPO.

In this section, we examine different ways of
creating factuality preference data for factuality-
aware DPO training. First, for each fact-based
instruction, instead of choosing the responses
(among the 4 generated responses) with the max-
imum and minimum factuality rewards (RMfact)
as the respective positive and negative samples,
we enumerate all the possible response pairs and
choose the response with higher (lower) RMfact

as the positive (negative) sample from each enu-
merated pair. If the difference of RMfact is smaller than 0.2, we treat them as equal and discard the
pairs. Note that for both row 1 and 2 in Table 7, we also discard the pairs with the difference of
instruction-following rewards (RMIF) larger than 0.5 (as mentioned in Section 4.2.2). Alternatively,
for each response, we linearly combine the rewards, RMIF (1–5 scale) and RMfact (0–1 scale), with
the respective weight of 1 and 5 as a composite reward. For each instruction, we choose the responses
with the maximum and minimum composite rewards as the positive and negative. As a result, both
data creation approaches increase the number of factuality preference pairs; however, they yield trivial
improvement in factuality but slight degrade in instruction following (rows 2, 3 vs 1). This result
also indicates that leveraging a single reward model, which can be incorporated with PPO [Schulman
et al., 2017], is possible to improve both models’ instruction-following capability and factuality

Table 8 lists the average length of models’ re-
sponses for each dataset. We observe that DPO
fine-tuned models tend to output lengthy re-
sponses than SFT except for DPOfact on Biog-
raphy. This trend indicates that our instruction-
following reward model RMIF guides LLMs to
output more detailed and lengthy responses. In
addition, we observe that although DPO
out-

9


---Page Break---
puts responses with similar length as DPO on Alpaca Eval, DPO
generates a slightly shorter
responses for the fact-based instructions in the other three datasets. This results show that our
factuality-aware DPO training mainly impacts models’ responses for fact-based instructions. The
impact is mainly to reduce the false claims, evidenced by the numbers of erroneous facts in rows 2
and 4 of Table 3).

6.5
Case Studies

Figure 10 (in Appendix) showcases the generations of different models, SFT, SFT + DPO and
SFT + DPO , on Alpaca Eval and Biography. Given the instruction, “What are the names of some
famous actors that started their careers on Broadway?”, SFT only lists some names of Broadway
actors while DPO fine-tuned models generate detailed information for each listed Broadway actor.
As for biography generations, we observe that given the instruction to generate a biography for a rare
name entity, Marianne McAndrew, SFT + DPO generates a detailed response but with many wrong
facts while SFT and SFT + DPO give relatively short responses. For the frequent entity, Ji Sung,
all the models generate detailed and mostly correct responses. This qualitative analysis shows that
SFT + DPO tends to generate detailed responses for most instructions, but for those instructions
required tailed knowledge (e.g., rare entity) likely unknown to LLMs [Mallen et al., 2023], it reduces
erroneous facts by giving less detailed responses, which is also observed by Kang et al. [2024].

Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we present a study to enhance the factuality of large language models (LLMs). We
first identify that the standard alignment approach, comprising SFT and RLAIF with DPO, may
inadvertently encourage LLMs to produce more erroneous facts. Specifically, during the SFT
stage, fine-tuning LLMs with high-quality human responses may introduce unfamiliar information,
prompting LLMs to output unknown facts. Additionally, during the DPO stage, enhancing LLMs’
ability to follow instructions may result in more detailed and lengthy responses but often leads
to increased hallucination. To tackle the shortcomings of the standard alignment, we propose a
factuality-aware alignment method, which includes factuality-aware SFT and DPO. Quantitative
and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our factuality-aware alignment not only guides LLMs to
generate detailed and helpful responses but also helps prevent the generation of false claims.

While we have successfully integrated factuality into standard alignment procedure, our work only
considers two alignment skill sets: instruction following (or helpfulness) and factuality. In practice,
each instruction may require consideration of multiple and distinct alignment skill sets [Saha et al.,
2024]. The method to optimize for these skill sets tailored to each query requires further study. In our
experiments, we note that optimizing preferences solely for instruction following or factuality could
potentially compromise the other. While our factuality-aware alignment demonstrated improvements
in both aspects, it is uncertain whether there is a trade-off between the two aspects when integrating
our approach to large-scale alignment [Touvron et al., 2023]. Finally, as shown in Appendix Figure 7,
not all the claims (or sentences) in a response require fact verification, a more accurate factuality
reward model should take this factor into account. While our preliminary experiment, which removes
non-fact-based sentences from the factuality reward modeling (Section 6.2), shows suboptimal
performance, we believe that further study can bring more insights.

A.1
Biography Data Generation

Entities for Training and Evaluation.
We use 500 diverse human entities to create training data
for SFT and DPO; then, evaluate LLMs’ generation factuality on another 183 human entities from
Min et al. [2023].9 Note that the human entities for training and evaluation are uniformly sampled
from entities across diverse nationalities, professions, and rarities. The instruction is generated with
the format: Tell me a bio of entity name.

Creating Training Data for SFT.
We randomly sample 5 human entities among the 500 entities
for training and generate their biographies using Llama-2-Chat 70B as 5-shot demonstration.10 With
the 5-shot demonstration, we use pre-trained Llama-2 7B to generate 10 biographies for each human
entity from the remaining 495 ones.11 We set temperature 0.7 and top-p 0.9 when generate multiple
responses from LLMs in all our experiments. We use the created 4,950 name entity–biography pairs
to fine-tune the pre-trained Llama-2 7B. As for generating training data with RAG, we prepend the
top-10 passages from our retrieval system (detailed in Appendix A.2) to each instruction and generate
10 biographies for each entity from RAG with 5-shot demonstrations. Note that we only prepend
top-1 passage for each instruction in the demonstration.

Creating Factuality Preference Pairs for DPO.
To construct factuality preference pairs, we first
compute FACTSCORE (FS) for all the 4,950 biographies previously created by PT. Then, for each
name entity, we compare the FS for all the possible 45 pairs from the 10 generated biographies and
construct DPO pairs using the biography with a higher (lower) FS as a positive (negative). Note that
we discard the pairs if they show tied FS.

A.2
Retrieval Models

For each query, we retrieve top-20 candidate passages from Wikipedia using DRAGON+ [Lin et al.,
2023] and re-rank the candidates using a 12-layer cross-encoder12. We use the Wikipedia version
from the Dec. 20, 2021 dump released by Izacard et al. [2023] in this work.

A.3
Alignment with Self Rewarding

SFT.
At SFT stage, we fine-tune PT on two seed datasets: (1) Instruction-following training (IFT)
data from Li et al. [2024], consisting of 3200 instruction–response pairs created by humans from
Open Assistant dataset [OASST; Köpf et al., 2023], where we only use the first conversational turns
in the English that are annotated rank 0;13 (2) evaluation following training (EFT) data from Yuan
et al. [2024], the LLM-as-a-Judge data consists of 1630 samples, each of which contains instruction,
human response and the corresponding score of 1-5 scale (with chain-of-though evaluation reasoning):
(x, y, r), where (x, y) pairs are also selected from OASST other than training pairs and r is created
by the model fine-tuned only on IFT with manual filtering. The purpose of EFT is to enhance a
LLM’s capability as a reward model to judge the quality of a response in terms of relevance, coverage,
usefulness, clarity and expertise. We refer readers to Yuan et al. [2024] for how EFT is created and
filtered with minimum human efforts. The prompt template for LLM-as-a-Judge in EFT and an EFT
training sample are shown in Appendix, Figure 8 and 9. We refer the baseline model fine-tuned on
the IFT and EFT datasets as SFT.

DPO for Instruction Following.
At the subsequent preference learning with DPO, following
Wang et al. [2023a], we augment additional 20K instructions with Llama-2 70B chat model.14
For each augmented instruction x, we use SFT to generate 4 responses and evaluate how well
the responses follow the instruction with score of 1–5 scale: RMIF(x, y0) · · · ; RMIF(x, y3), where

y0, · · · , y3 ∈SFT(x) and RMIF is the instruction-following reward model. Note that, in self-
rewarding [Yuan et al., 2024], RMIF is the same as SFT model. In addition, for each instruction–
response pair, we use the same prompt in EFT seed data to sample the chain-of-thought evaluation
three times and average the scores as the reward. Finally, for each instruction, we use the response
with the highest (lowest) reward as the positive (negative) sample to form a preference pair for DPO
training: (x, y+, y−). We discard the pair, if RMIF(x, y+) = RMIF(x, y−). In the DPO training, the
model is initialized from SFT and the fine-tuned model is denoted SFT + DPO.

GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021]. A slight drop from
FLAME is observed. This is possibly because we
mainly focus on the tasks of long-form response
generation while MMLU and GSM8K are the
benchmarks with short-form answers. The discrepancy between improving LLMs’ factuality on
long-form and short-form generation is also found by the previous work [Chuang et al., 2024].

A.5
Factuality Reward Modeling

Factuality Reward Models.
We build a reward model RMfact to measure the factuality of each
response. The factuality reward model consists of two main modules. (1) fact decomposition: we first
use nltk.tokenize to split a response into sentences; then, use our Llama-2 7B model fine-tuned
on public datasets [Liu et al., 2023, Chen et al., 2022, Malaviya et al., 2023] to conduct atomic fact
decomposition for each sentence.15 (2) Retrieval augmented claim verification: for each decomposed
fact (or claim), we use the instruct Llama 7B fine-tuned on Super Natural Instructions [Wang et al.,
2022] to do fact check with the prompt shown in Figure 5.16 We append 10 retrieved supports (using
the instruction as query) from our retrieval and re-ranking pipeline in Appendix A.2. Then, we
compute the proportion of correct atomic facts in a response as a factuality reward.

els. τ denotes the correlation between human

Quality of Factuality Reward Models.
We
conduct ablation study on our factuality reward
models. Specifically, we use our factuality reward
models to detect the number of error facts in
each instruction–response pair. We try different
models for fact check using the prompt shown
in Figure 5 with different numbers of retrieved
supports. We use the LLMs’ generated responses
with human annotated hallucination provided by
Mishra et al. [2024] to evaluate the quality of
the factuality reward models.17 Specifically, we
rank the responses by numbers of errors detected
and calculate the Kendall rank correlation (τ)
between the rank lists by our factuality reward models and humans. As shown in Table 10, conducing
fact check with more retrieved supports improves the accuracy of the factuality reward models (row 2
vs 1). In addition, our SFT, only fine-tuned on the IFT and EFT data, is capable of doing fact check,
compared to Instruct Llama 7B fine-tuned on Super Natural Instructions [Wang et al., 2022]. Finally,
instead of computing the number of error facts from decomposed atomic facts, we conduct fact check
directly for each sentence in a response and calculate the number of false sentences as error facts.
However, the quality of the reward models shows significant decrease (rows 5,6 vs 1,2). We finally
adopt row 2 as our factuality reward model.

15With few-shot demonstration, SFT is able to decompose a sentence into atomic facts with acceptable
accuracy. Fine-tuning a Llama-2 7B is to reduce the inference time.

Training Details

We fine-tune our models for 500 steps with a batch size of 32 and 64 on respective SFT and DPO
stages. The learning rate and maximum sequence length is set to 1e −6 (which decays to 1e −7) and
2048, respectively. At SFT stage, we mix the IFT and EFT while at DPO stage, we set β = 0.1 and
uniformly sample between self rewarding (x, y+, y−) and factuality reward (x, ytrue, yfalse) preference
data. Note that SFT (SFT ) + DPO meaning that we use SFT (SFT ) to create preference data,
serve as instruction-following reward model RMIFand as the initialization of DPO. The data used to
fine-tune different variants are listed in Table 11. We conduct fine-tuning with full parameters on 64
NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs. SFT and DPO require around 1 and 4 hours to complete, respectively.

A.7
Limitations

Limitations.
In this paper, we use FACTSCORE as the main metric of factuality. However, as
highlighted by Min et al. [2023], “FACTSCORE focuses on factual precision is only one aspect
of the broader factuality problem.” In addition, the validity of applying FACTSCORE to broader
domains other than Biography has not been carefully studied. In our experiments, we can only claim
that models’ generation shows high agreement with the facts from Wikipedia, without considering
whether the claims are open-ended and debatable. Finally, reward hacking is the potential issue of
LLM alignment [Chen et al., 2024b] but the risk of reward hacking is still unknown when considering
factuality.

A.8
Broader Impacts

Increased factual accuracy in AI-generated responses may contribute to building trust in AI technology.
Users are more likely to trust and rely on AI systems if they consistently provide accurate information,
leading to broader adoption and acceptance of AI-driven solutions. However, FLAME does not deal
with the facts which are open-ended and debatable and uses Wikipedia as the only source of facts.
This may inadvertently reinforce some biases in the AI system’s responses, potentially perpetuating
societal inequalities.

Sure, I can help you solve the cubic equation x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0 using 
Cardano's method. -- False 
Here are the steps: Step 1: Put the equation in the form x^3 + px + q = 0 x^3 
+ 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0 can be rearranged as x^3 + 0x^2 + 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0, so we 
have p = 0 and q = -1. -- False 
Step 2: Substitute x = y - b/3 in the equation, where b = -p/3 b = -p/3 = 0/3 = 
0, so we have b = 0. -- False 
Substituting x = y in the equation, we get: (y - 0)^3 + 0(y - 0) - 1 = 0 y^3 - 1 
= 0 Step 3: Solve for y y^3 - 1 = 0 can be factored as (y - 1)(y^2 + y + 1) = 0. 
-- False 
The roots of this equation are: y = 1 and y = (-1 ± sqrt(3)i)/2 Step 4: Find the 
roots of the original equation Substituting y = 1 into x = y - b/3, we get x = 1 
- 0/3 = 1. -- False 
So, 1 is one of the roots of the original equation. -- False 
Substituting y = (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2 into x = y - b/3, we get: x = (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2 
- 0/3 = (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2 Substituting y = (-1 - sqrt(3)i)/2 into x = y - b/3, we 
get: x = (-1 - sqrt(3)i)/2 - 0/3 = (-1 - sqrt(3)i)/2 So, the roots of the original 
equation are: x = 1, x = (-1 + sqrt(3)i)/2, and x = (-1 - sqrt(3)i)/2 These are 
the three complex roots of the cubic equation x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0. -- True

The American Revolution was a pivotal moment in world history that 
marked the birth of the United States as a nation. -- True 
The events leading up to the Revolution began when the American colonies 
were still under British rule and were becoming increasingly discontent with 
the taxes and regulations imposed upon them by the British government. -- 
True 
One of the most significant events leading up to the Revolution was the 
Boston Tea Party, where American colonists dumped British tea into the 
harbor as a symbol of their anger towards the British tea tax. -- True 
This event was followed by a series of skirmishes between British troops and 
American colonists, which escalated into full-blown warfare. -- False 
The impact of the American Revolution was far-reaching, both domestically 
and internationally. -- True 
The Revolution inspired people around the world to fight for their own 
freedoms and led to the spread of democratic ideals. -- True 
In the United States, the Revolution led to the formation of a new 
government based on democratic principles, where citizens had a say in the 
laws that governed them. -- True 
Today, the American Revolution continues to be relevant as its ideals of 
democracy, freedom, and self-governance continue to inspire people around 
the world. -- True 
The American Revolution serves as a reminder that ordinary people can 
come together to fight for their rights and make a real difference in the 
world. -- False 
It is a testament to the power of the human spirit and the desire for freedom. 
-- False

of steps outlining the events surrounding Edward Snowden's leaking of classified government documents:\n\n    Edward Snowden was employed by
 
the U.S. government as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2006.\n\n Over the next several years, Snowden worked on
 
various projects for the NSA and gained access to highly classified information and documents.\n\n   In early 2013, Snowden became
 
increasingly concerned about the government's widespread surveillance activities and felt that the public had a right to know about
 
them.\n\n    Snowden began copying and collecting classified documents from the NSA's systems, taking care to cover his tracks.\n\n    In
 
May 2013, Snowden left his job in Hawaii and traveled to Hong Kong, where he met with journalists from The Guardian newspaper and provided
 
them with a selection of the classified documents he had obtained.\n\n    The Guardian published a series of articles based on the leaked
 
documents, starting in  June 2013, which revealed the extent of the NSA's surveillance activities, including its collection of metadata on
 
millions of American citizens and its access to the servers of major tech companies like Google and Facebook.\n\n    The U.S. government
 
charged Snowden with violating the Espionage Act and sought his extradition from Hong Kong.\n\n    Fearing for his safety and freedom,
 
Snowden left Hong Kong and traveled to Moscow, where he was granted asylum by the Russian government.\n\n    Snowden has been living in
 
Russia since 2013 and continues to speak out against government surveillance and advocate for privacy and civil liberties.\n\nThese are the
 
major steps in the story of Edward Snowden's leaking of classified government documents to the press. The aftermath of these events
 
continues to shape the ongoing debates around privacy, security, and government surveillance.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main claim of our paper is to advance the understanding of the underlying
causes of LLM hallucination as well as its relation to the alignment procedure (from lines
22–23) and study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual (lines 5–6). We
thus conduct a pilot study to identify the key factors which impact the LLMs’ factuality
during alignment procedure in Section 3. Based on the finding, we implement the factuality-
aware alignment in Section 4 and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
comprehensive experiments in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the discussion of limitations in Appendix A.7.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

21


---Page Break---
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This is an empirical paper; thus, there is no theoretical result included.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include all the high-level information to reproduce our models in Section 4.1
and 4.2, and due to space limitation, more detailed information are included in Appendix A.3,
A.5 and A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.

22


---Page Break---
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: While we do not provide the code to reproduce the main experimental results,
we provide all the necessary information and URL links to training and evaluation data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide training details in Appendix A.6 and test details in Section 5.1

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We follow the instruction following evaluation in Alpaca Eval [Dubois et al.,
2024] to report the win rate comparisons between models, which is not suitable for statistical
significance test. For FACTSCORE, we follow the established procedure to compare models’
average FACTSCORE [Min et al., 2023], which is correlated to human evaluation.

Guidelines:

23


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the required computation resources in Appendix A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have reviewed and made sure our paper conforms the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

24


---Page Break---
Justification: We have included the discussion of broader impacts in Appendix A.8.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release any new data and models in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited all the papers, which provide the models and datasets used in
our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

25


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

26


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
