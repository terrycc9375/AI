Abstract

Image restoration has experienced significant advancements due to the development
of deep learning. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed prob-
lems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths.
Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address
these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most
existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models,
while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained
restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference,
leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice
for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem
of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an ex-
pectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for
aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights
on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble
inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allow-
ing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration
models. It consistently outperforms regression-based methods and averaging en-
semble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including
super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights
have been released in Github.

Introduction

Image restoration has witnessed significant progress over the decades, especially with the advent
of deep learning. Numerous architectures have been developed to solve the problem of restoration,
including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [10, 82], vision Transformers (ViTs) [39, 81,
93] and recently, vision Mambas [27]. However, single models with different architectures or
random initialization states exhibit prediction deviations from ground-truths, resulting in sub-optimal
restoration results.

To alleviate this problem, ensemble learning, a traditional but influential machine learning technique,
has been applied to image restoration. It involves combining several base models to obtain a better
result in terms of generalization and robustness [18, 20, 26, 49, 57]. However, most ensemble
methods in image restoration focus on training-stage ensemble requiring the ensemble strategy to
be determined while training multiple models, thus sacrificing flexibility of changing models and
convenience for plug-and-play usage [31, 35, 40, 44, 46, 54, 59, 70, 76]. In contrast, there is a demand
for advanced post-training ensemble methods in the image restoration industry, where researchers
still prefer averaging as their primary choice [1, 15, 41, 52, 66, 68, 92].

Despite the industrial demand, post-training ensemble in image restoration is challenging for tradition
ensemble algorithms originally designed for classification or regression. Unlike classification and
regression, image restoration predictions are matrices with each pixel is correlated with others and
range from 0 to 255. As a result, traditional methods like bagging [6] and boosting [28] either
require enormous computational resources for the restoration task or fail to generalize well due
to the imbalance between candidate number and feature dimension. As an alternative, Jiang et
al. propose a post-training ensemble algorithm for super-resolution by optimizing a maximum a
posteriori problem with a reconstruction constraint [31]. However, this constraint requires an explicit
expression of the degradation process, which is extremely difficult to define for other restoration
tasks beyond super-resolution. It also necessitates prior knowledge of the base models’ performance,
further limiting its practical application. These issues with both traditional and recent ensemble
methods lead researchers in image restoration to prefer weighted averaging as their primary ensemble
approach [1, 15, 52, 68, 92].

To this end, we formulate the ensemble of restoration models using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs),
where ensemble weights can be efficiently learned via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm
and stored in a lookup table (LUT) for subsequent inference. Specifically, we first base on the
Gaussian prior that assumes the prediction error of each model follows a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. Based on the prior, the predictions of multiple samples can be appended into a single
variable following Gaussian. By partitioning pixels into various histogram-like bins based on their
values, we can convert the problem of ensemble weight estimation into various solvable univariate
GMMs. As a result, the univariate GMMs can be solved to obtain range-wise ensemble weights by
the EM algorithm, with the means and variances of Gaussian components estimated based on the
observation priors. We estimate these weights on a reference set and store them in a LUT for efficient
inference on the test set. Our method does not require training or prior knowledge of the base models
and degradation processes, making it applicable to various image restoration tasks.

Our contributions mainly lie in three areas:

• Based on the Gaussian prior, we partition the pixels of model predictions into range-wise
bin sets of mutually exclusive ranges and derive the ensemble of multi-model predictions
into weight estimation of various solvable univariate GMMs.

• To solve the univariate GMMs and estimate ensemble weights, we leverage the EM algorithm
with means and variances initialized by observed prior knowledge. We construct a LUT to
store the range-wise ensemble weights for efficient ensemble inference.

• Our ensemble algorithm does not require extra training or knowledge of the base models.
It outperforms existing post-training ensemble methods on 14 benchmarks across 3 image
restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining.

Ensemble Methods.
Ensemble methods refer to approaches that fuse the predictions of multiple
base models to achieve better results than any of individual model [20]. Traditional ensemble methods
include bagging [6], boosting [28], random forests [7], gradient boosting [24], histogram gradient
boosting [14, 34], etc. These methods have been applied to various fields in classification and
regression, such as biomedical technology [77, 78], intelligent transportation [53, 84], and pattern
recognition [61, 91].

Image restoration.
Image restoration, as a thriving area of computer vision, has been making
significant progress since the advent of deep learning [10, 65]. Various model architectures have been

---Page Break---
proposed to address image restoration tasks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [19, 56,
73, 90], multilayer perceptron (MLPs) [67], vision Transformers (ViTs) [39, 62, 81], etc. Additionally,
various structural designs like multi-scale [56], multi-patch [64, 89], and progressive learning [82]
have been adopted to improve the representative capacity. It is known that CNNs excel at encoding
local features, while ViTs are adept at capturing long range dependencies. Despite this significant
progress, single models still generate predictions that deviate from ground-truths, leading researchers
in industry to adopt multi-model ensembles to achieve better performance [15, 52, 68, 92].

Ensemble Learning in Image Restoration.
Some works incorporate ensemble learning into image
restoration by training multiple networks simultaneously and involving ensemble strategy during the
training process [2, 3, 9, 11–13, 16, 17, 21, 29, 31, 33, 35–38, 40, 42–46, 54, 55, 59, 63, 69, 70, 72,
75, 76, 79, 80, 85, 87]. However, the majority of them require additional training or even training
from scratch alongside ensemble. Only a few focus on ensemble at the post-training stage [31, 66].
Among them, self-ensemble [66] geometrically augments an input image, obtains super-resolution
predictions of augmented candidates and applies averaging ensemble to the candidates, which is
orthogonal to the scope of our work. RefESR [31] requires a reconstruction objective which must get
access to the degradation function, prohibiting its application to tasks other than super-resolution.
In general, limited works focus on the training-free ensemble of image restoration. There lacks a
general ensemble algorithm for restoration despite industry demand [1, 15, 52, 68, 92].

Proposed Ensemble Method for Image Restoration

In Sec. 3.1, we first present the formulation of the ensemble problem in image restoration. We then
formulate our ensemble method in the format of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) over partitioned
range-wise bin sets in Sec. 3.2. We derive the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with known
mean and variance as prior knowledge to solve the GMMs problems in Sec. 3.3

3.1
Ensemble Formulation of Image Restoration

Given a test set T = {ˆXn, ˆYn} with numerous pairs of input images and ground-truths, suppose
we have M pre-trained base models for image restoration, f1, ..., fM. For a model fm where
m ∈{1, ..., M}, its prediction is denoted by ˜Xm,n = fm(ˆXn) for abbreviation. We consider the
ensemble of the predictions as a weighted averaging, i.e.,
˜Yn = β⊤
n
˜X1,n
· · ·
˜XM,n

, ∀n
(1)

where ˜Yn is the ensemble result, and βn ∈RM is the vector of weight parameters for the ensemble.
The widely-used averaging ensemble strategy in image restoration assigns equal weights for all
samples and pixels, i.e., βn =
 1

M
· · ·

M

. A recent method in the NTIRE 2023 competition
assigns weights inversely proportional to the mean squared error between the predictions and their
average [92]. However, they adopt globally constant weights for all pixels and samples, neglecting
that the performances of base models may fluctuate for different patterns and samples.

Alternatively, we start from the prospective of GMMs and assign range-specific weights based on the
EM algorithm.

3.2
Restoration Ensemble as Gaussian Mixture Models

Similar to RefESR [31], suppose we have a reference set D = {Xn, Yn}N
n=1 with N pairs of input
images and ground-truths. We assume the reference set and test set are sampled from the same data
distribution, i.e., D, T ∼D.

For each model fm, its prediction is denoted by Xm,n = fm(Xn) ∈R3×H×W . We use xm,n, yn ∈
RL to represent the flattened vector of the matrices Xm,n, Yn, where L = 3HW. Based on Gaussian
prior, it can be assumed that the estimation error of a model on an image follows a zero-mean Gaussian
distribution, namely ϵm,n = yn −xm,n ∼N(0, Σm,n), where Σm,n ∈RL×L is the covariance
matrix of the Gaussian. Then the observed ground-truth can be considered following a multivariate
Gaussian with the mean equal to the prediction, i.e., yn|fm, xn ∼N(xm,n, Σm,n).

We can consider the ensemble problem as the weighted averaging of Gaussian variables and estimate
the weights by solving its maximum likelihood estimation. However, solving the sample-wise mixture

of Gaussian is not feasible because the covariance matrices are sample-wise different and thus hard to
estimate. Besides, the number of prediction samples is much fewer than feature dimension, resulting
in the singularity of the covariance matrices. Please refer to Sec. A.1 in Appendix for details.

In contrast, we alternatively append the reference set into a single sample following Gaussian as

y1:N|fm, x1:N ∼N (xm,1:N, diag(Σm,1, ..., Σm,N)) ,
(2)

where y1:N = [y1
· · ·
yN] ∈RNL and xm,1:N = [xm,1
· · ·
xm,N] ∈RNL are the con-
catenation of observed ground-truths and restored samples respectively. Since data samples can be
considered following i.i.d data distribution D, the variance of the concatenated samples is diagonal.

However, the covariance matrix is still singular due to the imbalance between prediction sample
number and feature dimension. Thus, directly mixing the multivariate Gaussian is still infeasible to
solve. We thus alternatively categorize pixels into various small bins of mutually exclusive ranges
such that the pixels within each range can be considered following a univariate Gaussian distribution
according to the central limit theorem. Concretely, we separate the prediction range of models
into T bins with each of width b, i.e., B = {[0, b), [b, 2b), ..., [(T −1)b, 255]}. The upper bound
would be 1 instead of 255 if the value range is within [0, 1]. Given a bin Bm = [(t −1)b, tb) ∈B
and a pixel of prediction at location i, we define an indicator function IBm(x(i)
m,1:N) such that it

returns 1 if x(i)
m,1:N ∈Bm and 0 otherwise. For multiple models, we have M bins to form a bin

set (B1, ..., BM) ∈BM, and define the mask map as Rr = QM
m=1 IBm(xm,1:N) ∈{0, 1}NL where

r = 1, ..., T M. It holds PT M

r=1 Rr = 1 and QT M

r=1 Rr = 0. For each bin set (B1, ..., BM) ∈BM, we
can select pixels within the bin set from the original image vectors by

yr,1:N = Rr · y1:N,
xr,m,1:N = Rr · xm,1:N,
(3)

where the operation {·} denotes the element-wise product. By the central limit theorem, we assume
the nonzero pixels within each bin follow a Gaussian distribution with the mean µr,m,1:N and variance
σr,m,1:N, i.e.,

y(i)
r,1:N|fm, xr,m,1:N
i.i.d
∼N(µr,m,1:N, σr,m,1:N), ∀i ∈[1, ..., Nr],
(4)

---Page Break---
where Nr is the number of nonzero pixels in Rr such that PT M

r=1 Nr = NL, and the values of
µr,m,1:N and σr,m,1:N can be estimated by the mean and variance of Nr prediction pixels within the
current bin set.

The reference set is therefore separated into T M number of bin sets, and the ground-truth pixels
inside each of them form a solvable univariate GMM. We then introduce the latent variable z such that
z = m if the pixel y(i)
r,1:N follows the m-th Gaussian by the model fm. It represents the probability of
the pixel belonging to the m-th Gaussian component, which is equivalent to the role of the ensemble
weight for the m-th base model. By writing αr,m = P(z = m), we have

r,1:N; µr,m,1:N, σr,m,1:N) is the density function of Gaussian
N(µr,m,1:N, σr,m,1:N).

The value of ensemble weights can be estimated by the maximum likelihood estimates of the observed
ground-truths, i.e.,

{αr,m}r,m ∈arg max P(y1:N).
(6)

Because arbitrary two bin sets are mutually exclusive, we can safely split the optimization of
maximum likelihood over y1:N into T M optimization problems of maximum likelihood over yr,1:N.

Lookup Table and Inference

We store the range-specific weights estimated on the reference set into a LUT with each key of
(B1, ..., BM). During the inference stage for a test sample ˆXn, we have the prediction of the m-th
base model as ˜Xm,n = fm(ˆXn). For a bin set (B1, ..., BM), we partition input pixels of multiple
models into each bin set as

˜Xr,m,n = Rr · ˜Xm,n, where Rr =

M
Y

m=1
IBm(˜Xm,n).
(14)

Then we retrieve the estimated range-wise weights αr,m from the LUT based on each key of the bin
set and obtain the aggregated ensemble by

Benchmarks.
We evaluate our ensemble
method on 3 image restoration tasks includ-
ing super-resolution, deblurring, and derain-
ing.
For super-resolution, we use Set5 [5],
Set14 [83], BSDS100 [47], Urban100 [30] and
Manga109 [48] as benchmarks. For deblurring,
we use GoPro [51], HIDE [60], RealBlur-J and
-R [58]. For deraining, we adopt Rain100H [74],
Rain100L [74], Test100[88], Test1200 [86], and
Test2800 [25].

Metrics.
We use peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR) and structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) [71] to quantitatively evaluate the image
restoration quality. Additionally, we compare
the average runtime per image in seconds to eval-
uate the ensemble efficiency. Following prior
works [27, 39, 67, 81, 82, 93], PSNR and SSIM
are computed on Y channel of the YCbCr color
space for image super-resolution and deraining.

Base Models.
To evaluate the generalization of ensemble methods against model choices, we
employ a wide variety of base models, including CNNs, ViTs, MLPs and Mambas. For image
super-resolution, we use SwinIR [39], SRFormer [93], and MambaIR [27]. We choose MPRNet [82],
DGUNet [50], and Restormer [81] for deblurring, as well as MPRNet [82], MAXIM [67], and
Restormer [81] for deraining.

Baselines.
We utilize regression algorithms including bagging [6], AdaBoost [22], random forests
(RForest) [7], gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) [23], histogram gradient boosting decision
tree (HGBT) [14, 34] as baselines. Averaging is also a commonly used ensemble baseline. A recent
method proposed by team ZZPM in the NTIRE 2023 competition [92] is also included for comparison.
Additionally, we adopt RefESR [31] for image super-resolution ensemble.

Implementation Details.
We choose the bin width as 32 by default for the balance of efficiency and
performance. The EM solver of GMM stops after 1000 iterations or when the change of log likelihood
is less than 1e−5. For cases where Nr is fewer than 100 or the EM solution is undetermined, we
use averaging weights by default. The values are reported by taking the average of 4 trials. For the
construction of the reference set, we randomly select one image from the training set of DIV2K [4]
for super-resolution, while for deblurring and deraining, we sample 10 images from the training sets
of GoPro [51] and Rain13K [32], respectively. All the experiments are run in Python on a device
with an 8-cores 2.10GHz Intel Xeon Processor and 32G Nvidia Tesla V100. The regression-based
ensemble algorithms are implemented based on scikit-learn [8].

Experimental Results

4.2.1
Ablation Study

We conduct ablation studies on the bin width b and the maximum step number of the EM algorithm
on the benchmark of Rain100H [74]. The results are shown in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 respectively. We
can observe that the bin width involves a trade-off between ensemble accuracy and the efficiency .
A small b generates better ensemble results but makes ensemble inference slower. In the following
experiments, we choose the bin width b = 32 by default for the balance of efficiency and performance.
On the other hand, a large maximum step number does not necessarily yield better ensemble result.
Therefore, we choose 1000 as the maximum step number.

4.2.2
Quantitative Results

We present quantitative comparisons with existing ensemble methods in Tab. 3 for super-resolution,
Tab. 4 for deblurring, and Tab. 5 for deraining. Our method generally outperforms all existing methods
across the 3 image restoration tasks and 14 benchmarks. Note that Average and ZZPM [92] generally
perform better than regression-based ensemble methods. However, in cases where one of the base

models significantly underperforms compared to the others, such as MPRNet [82] on Rain100L [74]
and Test100 [88], these regression methods outperform Average and ZZPM [92]. In contrast, our
method, which learns per-value weights, can recognize performance biases and alleviate such issue.
ZZPM [92] performs comparably to Average in our experiments rather than outperforming it, because
the base models are not always equally good and one model may be consistently better than the
others. Thus, weights negatively proportional to the mean squared error may exaggerate deviation
from optimal prediction. In contrast, our method consistently performs well for all cases.

4.2.3
Qualitative Results

We also provide qualitative visual comparisons in Fig. 1, 2 and 3. In Fig. 1, the base model
SwinIR [39] mistakenly upscales the character’s eye. While existing ensemble algorithms partially
alleviate this mistake, they cannot fully discard the hallucinated line inside the eye. In contrast, our
method with the bin width b = 32 that learns fine-grained range-wise weights successfully recovers
the pattern. In Fig. 2, only our method can effectively obtain a better ensemble with sharp edges and
accurate colors. In Fig. 3, we can observe that MPRNet [82] removes all stripe patterns on the ground
together with rain streaks. The conventional weighted summation yields a dimmer ensemble result,
and the HGBT method fails to learn accurate weight distributions, resulting in an unsmooth result. In
contrast, ours alleviates the issue. More visual comparisons are provided in Fig. 7-18 in Appendix.

4.2.4
Extensions

Efficiency.
The efficiency of ensemble methods is compared by measuring the average runtime on
Rain100H [74], as shown in Tab. 6. Although our method is slower than Average and ZZPM [92],

it is much faster than all the regression-based methods. By slightly sacrificing performance with
b = 64, it can achieve real-time inference, as indicated in Tab. 1.

Visualization.
We also present the visualization examples of ensemble weights, image features and
pixel distributions in Fig. 4-6 in Appendix. Due to page limit, please refer to Sec. B of Appendix.

Limitation and Future Work.
The trade-off between the runtime and performance has not been
solved yet. Achieving real-time ensemble would lead to performance degradation. The issue could
be resolved by GPU vectorization acceleration and distributed computing. Additionally, if all base
models fail, ensemble methods cannot generate better result. We leave them in the future work.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an ensemble algorithm for image restoration based on GMMs. We partition
the pixels of predictions and ground-truths into separate bins of exclusive ranges and formulate the
ensemble problem using GMMs over each bin. The GMMs are solved on a reference set, and the
estimated ensemble weights are stored in a lookup table for the ensemble inference on the test set.
Our algorithm outperforms regression-based ensemble methods as well as commonly used averaging
strategies on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring
and deraining. It is training-free, model-agnostic, and thus suitable for plug-and-play usage.

Appendix

A
Derivation

We first list the theorems necessary for the subsequent derivations

Theorem A.1. Suppose X ∼N(µX, σX) and Y ∼N(µY , σY ) are two independent random
variables following univariate Gaussian distribution. If we have another random variable defined as
Z = X + Y , then the variable follows Z ∼N(µX + µY , σX + σY ).

Theorem A.2. Suppose X ∼N(µX, ΣX) and Y ∼N(µY , ΣY ) are two independent random
variables following multivariate Gaussian distribution. If we have another random variable defined
as Z = X + Y, then the variable follows Z ∼N(µX + µY , ΣX + ΣY ).

Theorem A.3. Suppose X ∼N(µ, Σ) is a random variable following multivariate Gaussian
distribution, where µ ∈RL. Given a constant vector a ∈RL, we have the variable Y = a · X ∼
N(a · µ, a⊤a · Σ).

In Sec. A.1 and A.2, it is shown the mixture of multivariate Gaussian is difficult to solve with limited
samples while large feature dimension. In Sec. A.3, we derive the updating of GMMs for the pixels
within a bin set. Its convergence is proved in Sec. A.4.

A.1
Sample-wise Maximum Likelihood Estimation of multivariate Gaussian Ensemble

If we directly consider the ensemble problem by the sample-wise weighted summation of multivariate
Gaussian with the ensemble weights βn,m such that PM
m=1 βn,m = 1, i.e.,

yn|f1, ..., fM, xn ∼N

.
(16)

The log likelihood is therefore

log P (y1, ..., yN|f1, ..., fM, x1, ..., xN)

= log

n=1
P (yn|f1, ..., fM, xn)

(17)

The weights can be found via computing the maximum likelihood estimates by
∂L
∂βn,m = 0. However,
the derivative is complicated, sample-wisely different and related to both unknown and sample-wise
covariance matrices. Directly making sample-wise ensemble is thereby difficult to solve.

Besides, if we use multivariate GMMs with the EM algorithm, the estimation of covariance requires
the computation of its inverse. However, we only have M observed samples while L features with
L ≫M for each prediction sample. The covariance matrix is singular and thus multivariate GMMs
cannot be solved.

A.2
Set-level Maximum Likelihood Estimation of multivariate Gaussian Ensemble

If we directly consider the ensemble problem by the weighted summation of multivariate Gaussian
over the reference set with the ensemble weights βn,m such that PM
m=1 βm = 1, i.e.,

y1:N|f1, ..., fM, x1:N ∼N

The log likelihood is therefore

= −1

2 PM

(19)

We can compute the optimal maximum likelihood estimate by making
∂L
∂βm = 0. Because we only
have M observed samples while NL features with NL ≫M for each prediction sample. The
unknown covariance matrix still cannot be estimated by multivariate GMMs with the EM algorithm,.
The estimation of covariance requires the computation of its inverse. The covariance matrix is singular
and thus the multivariate GMMs cannot be solved.

A.3
Derivation of GMMs in a bin set

For each bin set, we have converted the problem into the format of GMMs, i.e.,

P(y(i)

(20)

where z ∈{1, ..., M} is the latent variable that represents the probability of the m-th mixture, and

P

y(i)
r,1:N
 z = m

is the m-th mixture probability component. We use αr,m = P(z = m) to denote

the mixture proportion or the probability that y(i)
r,1:N belongs to the m-th mixture component. We
assume the pixels within the bin follow the Gaussian distribution based on the central limit theorem,
i.e., y(i)
r,1:N
i.i.d
∼N(µr,m,1:N, σr,m,1:N) and P

.
The mean and variance of the bin are denoted as µr,m,1:N and σr,m,1:N.

Suppose we have Nr data samples in the bin, then for the Nr observations, we have its joint probability

The convergence is therefore guaranteed. The prior of mean does not affect the convergence.

More Visualizations

B.1
Weight Visualization

We plot the heatmap of ensemble weights on an example from HIDE [60]. The weight heatmaps
for averaging, ZZPM [92] and ours are shown in Fig. 4. We can see that ours assigns more detailed
weight on its prediction to preserve textures.

B.2
Feature Visualization

We plot the image feature visualization via the dimension reduction of principal components analysis
(PCA). We randomly sample 8 images from HIDE [60]. For each image, we obtain its restoration
predictions of base models, the ensemble results of averaging, ZZPM [92], HGBT [34] and ours. A
pre-trained ResNet110 is used to encode images into features. The visualizations are shown in Fig. 5
It can be found that ours can consistently yield the results closer to the gorund-truths (GT).

B.3
Distribution Visualization

Note that we hypotheses of pixels within each bin set following Gaussian and their weights of GMMs
learnt on the reference set can be used to fuse pixels on the test set. We validate them by plotting the
histograms within bin sets in Fig. 6. As seen, the distribution of the pixels within a bin follows either
typical Gaussian, plateau that can be considered as a flat Gaussian, or discrete signals that can be
considered as steep Gaussian. The relative location of the distributions among base model predictions
and ground-truths is also well preserved from the reference set to the test set.

We can notice that the simple averaging strategy can suffice for the case of the last row, while a biased
averaging towards DGUNet [50] and MPRNet [82] will be better for the case of the first two rows.
For the case of the third row, directly applying the prediction of DGUNet [50] will be the best. Our
method estimating the range-wise weights as the latent probability of GMMs can handle all the cases,
while the averaing strategies will fail.

More Visual Comparisons

We show more visual comparisons in Fig. 7-10 for image super-resolution, in Fig. 11-13 for image
deblurring, and in Fig. 14-18 for image deraining.

In Fig. 7, only ours is able to preserve gray reflection of the boat from SwinIR [39]’s prediction. In
Fig. 8-10, our method obtains the most accurate ensemble results in the case that one of base models
generates mistaken textures.

In Fig. 11, our method yield the sharpest and straight line like the ground-truth. In Fig. 12 and 13,
our ensemble method obtains the closest textures to the ground-truths.

In Fig. 14, our method gets the best ensemble despite the mistake from MAXIM [67]. In Fig. 15, ours
preserves the cleanest background to the ground-truth. In Fig. 16, only ours recovers the grid near the
eyeball. In Fig. 17 and 18, ours preserves the closest background textures to the ground-truths.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and introduction has accurately reflected the paper’s contribution
and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

25


---Page Break---
Justification: We have discussed the limitation of the last page of the main manuscript.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the complete proof in Appendix and the assumptions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have included all implementation and experimental details in Sec. 4

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

26


---Page Break---
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have released our codes and all ensemble weights.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

---Page Break---
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have specified all the implementation details in Sec. 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The scales of the tables are huge and the inclusion of error bars is expensive
and violate the page limit.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have shown the computer resources in Sec. 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

28


---Page Break---
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no social impact of the work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

29


---Page Break---
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited all the original paper referenced to.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not release new assets in this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

30


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
