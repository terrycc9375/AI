Abstract

Recent developments of vision large language models (LLMs) have seen remark-
able progress, yet still encounter challenges towards multimodal generalists, such
as coarse-grained instance-level understanding, lack of unified support for both im-
ages and videos, and insufficient coverage across various vision tasks. In this paper,

we present VITRON, a universal pixel-level vision LLM designed for comprehen-
sive understanding, generating, segmenting, and editing of both static images and
dynamic videos. Building on top of an LLM backbone, VITRON incorporates
encoders for images, videos, and pixel-level regional visuals within its frontend
modules, while employing state-of-the-art visual specialists as its backend, via
which VITRON supports a spectrum of vision end tasks, spanning visual comprehen-
sion to visual generation, from low level to high level. To ensure an effective and
precise message passing from LLM to backend modules for function invocation,
we propose a novel hybrid method by simultaneously integrating discrete textual
instructions and continuous signal embeddings. Further, we design various pixel-
level spatiotemporal vision-language alignment learning for VITRON to reach the
best fine-grained visual capability. Finally, a cross-task synergy module is advised
to learn to maximize the task-invariant fine-grained visual features, enhancing the
synergy between different visual tasks. Demonstrated over 12 visual tasks and
evaluated across 22 datasets, VITRON showcases its extensive capabilities in the
four main vision task clusters. Overall, this work illuminates the great potential of
developing a more unified multimodal generalist.

Introduction

Recently, the field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has witnessed rapid and flourishing
development across multiple communities. Extensive research efforts have been directed towards
augmenting powerful, purely language-based LLMs with modules capable of visual perception,
thereby extending their applicability to MLLMs [1, 49, 63, 127, 77, 111, 27]. MLLMs, such as BLIP-
2 [49], LLaVA [63], MiniGPT-4 [138] and GPT-4V [121] etc., demonstrate a robust and exceptional
capability in image understanding, paralleling the deep semantic comprehension of language. In
the realm of vision, the ability to process and comprehend dynamic videos is equally critical.
Concurrently, several MLLMs have emerged with a focus on video understanding, e.g., VideoChat
[50] and Video-LLaMA [128], demonstrating significant advancements in video comprehension.

Subsequent studies have sought to further expand the capabilities of MLLMs, with efforts bifurcating
into two primary dimensions. On one hand, there’s a deepening of MLLMs’ understanding of
vision, transitioning from coarse, instance-level comprehension towards a pixel-level, fine-fined
understanding of images, thereby achieving visual regional grounding capabilities, as seen in GLaMM
[84], PixelLM [85], and MiniGPT-v2 [11], etc., alongside the counterparts in pixel-grounding video
LLMs [74]. On the other hand, there’s an expansion in the breadth of functionalities MLLMs
can support within the vision field. A portion of the research has already ventured into enabling
MLLMs not just to comprehend input vision signals but also to support the generation and output of
vision content, with systems like GILL [43], Emu [96], etc., flexibly generating image content, and
GPT4Video [105] and NExT-GPT [114] achieving video generation.

We posit that the future trend of vision LLMs necessarily involves the enhancement of their capabilities
towards a high degree of unification, i.e., multimodal generalists. However, our observations reveal
that despite the diversity of existing vision LLMs developed by the community, there is still a clear
lack of unification. First, almost all existing vision LLMs treat images and videos as separate entities,
either supporting only images or videos [1, 96, 138, 128]. We argue for a unified vision MLLM
framework that concurrently supports both images and videos, acknowledging that vision inherently
comprises both static images and dynamic videos - both core components of our world and largely
interchangeable in most scenarios. Second, the current support for vision functionalities in MLLMs
is found wanting, with most models only capable of understanding [63, 138], or at most generating
images or videos [20, 105]. We contend that future MLLMs should embrace a broader spectrum of
vision tasks and functionalities, enabling unified support for all vision-related tasks and achieving an
“one for all” capability, which is vital for real-world applications, especially in vision creation that
often involves a series of iterative and interactive operations. For example, users typically start by
generating images from text, transforming an idea into visual content; and then refining this content
through further fine-grained editing to add more details; following, proceeding to create dynamic
content by generating videos from the images; and finally, engaging in several rounds of iterative
interaction, such as video editing, to enhance and finalize their creation. Last but not the least, for a
generalist integrated with various multimodal functionalities, one key lies in how to ensure that all
tasks achieve their best performance as much as possible. This includes both that, 1) the instructions

from the LLM are precisely conveyed to the downstream decoders, and 2) different tasks do not
undermine each other but rather cooperate.

To address all these gaps, this paper introduces VITRON, a pioneering universal pixel-level vision
LLM, as shown in Fig. 2. First, VITRON leverages a backbone LLM for comprehending, reasoning,
decision-making, and multi-round user interactions. To perceive both image and video modal signals
and support fine-grained user visual inputs, VITRON incorporates encoders for images, videos, and
regional box/sketch-specified inputs. On the backend, several state-of-the-art (SoTA) image and
video modules are integrated for decoding and executing a wide range of vision tasks, spanning
from lower to higher levels, such as visual understanding (perceiving and reasoning), generating,
segmenting (grounding and tracking), editing (inpainting). To ensure that VITRON precisely conveys
the LLM’s decisions to various backend decoder modules for function invocation, we propose a novel
hybrid method of instruction passing. Specifically, we enable the LLM to output not only discrete
textual instructions, but also continuous signal feature embeddings passed to the modules. Finally,
to maximize the functionalities of different modules within VITRON, we further devise a synergy
module, where we fully maximize the task-persistent fine-grained visual features to be shared among
different visual tasks.

The overall training for VITRON aims to equip it with robust and powerful vision understanding and
manipulation capabilities. We first imbue VITRON basic MLLM skills by carrying out 1) vision-
language alignment learning between the frontend encoders and central LLM, also 2) invocation-
oriented instruction tuning, and 3) embedding-oriented alignment tuning between LLM and backend
modules. Going beyond this, we further try to strengthen VITRON’s capacities. On the one hand, we
introduce fine-grained spatiotemporal vision grounding instruction tuning, training LLM on grounding
predictions and pixel-aware perception for images and videos, such that VITRON sufficiently gains
pixel-level visual perception. On the other hand, we utilize adversarial training [29, 100] to decouple
task-specific features from task-invariant fine-grained visual features in signal feature representations,
thereby enhancing the synergy between different tasks.

Extensive experiments covering 12 tasks across 22 datasets are performed. Leveraging its advanced
architecture as a multimodal generalist, VITRON demonstrates proficiency in a comprehensive range
of vision tasks. Notably, the unified system’s performance is on par with or even surpasses singleton
state-of-the-art specialists on specific tasks. Further analyses reveal the efficacy of each design of the
system. Our overall contributions are summarized as follows.

1 To our knowledge, we for the first time propose a grand unified vision MLLM, VITRON, capable
of pixel-level understanding, generating, segmenting, editing of both images and videos.

Related Work

Achieving a profound understanding and comprehensive operational capabilities in vision, ranging
from low-level visual pixel understanding [7, 65, 120, 46, 55, 122, 102, 52–54] to high-level compre-
hension of overall semantics [19, 45, 70, 23, 31, 38, 39, 48, 115, 26, 56, 24], represents a significant
topic. Recent years have seen the development of highly potent large-scale vision models, such as
ViT [21] and CLIP [83], which have achieved remarkable vision understanding capabilities; models
like SAM [42] and SEEM [139] have solved vision segmentation tasks; and diffusion-based models
[34, 82, 73, 28, 112, 86, 25] have reached unprecedented performance in vision generation. Yet these
models might lack an LLM as a central decision processor, unable to flexibly interpret user intent
or execute tasks interactively [97, 47, 114]. The emergence of LLMs has exhibited unprecedented
intelligence capability [76, 16, 99]. Extending the success of language understanding in LLMs, re-
searchers have promptly investigated and developed various MLLMs, enabling LLMs to comprehend
vision. By integrating high-performance vision encoders of images or videos into language-based
LLMs, these models have been made capable of understanding vision signals [77, 1, 49, 81, 63].
Going beyond vision understanding, further research has aimed to enhance MLLMs, for instance, by
endowing them with vision generation capabilities [43, 96] or supporting pixel-level understanding
and grounding [130, 125, 85, 132, 110]. In Table 1 we summarize some existing popular vision
MLLMs in terms of the vision function support.

However, we observe that current research on vision LLMs lacks depth in two critical aspects. Firstly,
current vision LLMs tend to separate images and videos, supporting either one or the other. The
construction of a unified MLLM is crucial, as vision inherently encompasses both static images
and dynamic videos, both of which are core components of our visual world. Thus, covering both
aspects simultaneously is essential for optimally adapting to practical applications. Although models
like NExT-GPT [114] have relatively well-supported unification across various modalities, they
fall short in supporting pixel-level in-depth vision understanding and comprehensive support for
vision operation tasks. The second issue is the incomplete support for vision tasks by existing
MLLMs. Most current MLLMs primarily support understanding images or videos [63, 138], with

4


---Page Break---
only a few supporting generation [20, 105] or editing/inpainting [113]. Building a generalist that
can handle (almost) all vision-related tasks and operations in an end-to-end architecture should
be the next major trend for vision MLLMs. Yet simply integrating existing visual specialists into
an LLM to form MLLMs is not sufficient enough, as genuine human-level AI should possess
universal intelligence with robust cross-task generalizability [72]. Thus, it is necessary to further
consider how to enable synergy effects [20] among different task specialists within a generalist, for
which goal, we have devised a synergy strategy in this work. Besides, compared to the multimodal
comprehension capabilities of MLLM, endowing MLLM with strong multimodal generative abilities
is even more challenging. The key lies in how to effectively and unbiasedly convey MLLM’s semantic
understanding signals to the backbone decoder modules. There are two mainstream approaches to
LLM-to-decoder message passing within the MLLM community. One is based on discrete textual
instructions [106, 90, 104], and the other on continuous signal embeddings [43, 20, 114]. However,
we find that these two methods are complementary. Specifically, the former allows the LLM to
efficiently convey task execution commands to the backend modules through simple text, but it
struggles to provide modality-specific signals; the latter can conveniently carry the features needed
for tasks, but fails to accurately convey execution intention (especially for managing many modules).
In this work, we propose a hybrid method by integrating them together.

Architecture of VITRON
VITRON takes most common ‘encoder-LLM-decoder’ architecture paradigm, as in existing popular
MLLMs [63, 20, 114]. The overall framework is shown in Fig. 2, where three key blocks are
included: 1) frontend vision&language encoders, 2) central LLM for semantics understanding and
text generation, and 3) backend decoder modules for user responding and vision manipulation.

3.1
Frontend Vision-Language Encoding
For both images and videos, we employ the CLIP ViT-L/14@336px [83] as the encoder, respectively.
The video encoder independently processes each frame, further employing average pooling across
the temporal dimension to yield overall temporal representation features. Then, we employ a regional
pixel-aware visual extractor as the sketch encoder for user interaction, e.g., clicking, drawing boxes
or polygons, and making scribbles. We mainly follow [125], and use the object-based representations
of mask regions that come from user’s inputs, which not only encode the pixel-level visual features
but also gather the spatial position information of each region. The region features are pooled with
also the binary mask of spatial geometry of the object region encoded, and the resulting embeddings
are used. Then, the multimodal feature representations are passed to LLM via linear projection.

3.2
Core LLM
In VITRON, an LLM serves as the pivotal agent. Following the most common practice [15, 94, 128],
we utilize Vicuna (7B, version 1.5). The LLM processes inputs from both language and visual
modalities to perform semantic understanding and reasoning, and then make decisions. For visual
comprehension tasks, LLM directly outputs textual responses for users. On the other side, LLM
also needs to transmit signals and instructions to backend modules, directing them to invocate more
complex tasks that go beyond text generation, such as visual segmentation, generation, and editing. As
emphasized earlier, the ability of LLMs to effectively and precisely convey messages is crucial to the
performance of complex multimodal tasks. To this end, we propose fully integrating the advantages
of the two common message-passing methods: discrete textual instructions and continuous signal
embeddings. The former aids in accurately invoking different backbone modules (thanks to the
LLM’s proficiency in task dispatching), while the latter supplements with richer modality-preserved
visual features that cannot be directly described through discrete text. As depicted in Fig. 2, the
LLM outputs 1) text responses for users, 2) text instructions for module invocation, and 3) feature
embeddings of special tokens. The feature embeddings are split into the task-specific features and the
task-invariant fine-grained visual-language features. Both the text instructions and feature embeddings
are passed to backbone modules.

3.3
Backend Visual Specialists
To enable our MLLM with various visual task abilities, we integrate an array of singleton vision
specialists into LLM. For image generation and editing, we integrate the diffusion-based model
GLIGEN [57]. For image and video segmentation, we opt for SEEM [139]. For video generation,
ZeroScope [8] and I2VGen-XL [131] are utilized for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks, respec-
tively. Lastly, for video editing functionality, we incorporate StableVideo [9]. The text instructions
from LLM first determine which task module to invoke; simultaneously, feature embeddings are fed

5


---Page Break---
into the corresponding module’s feature encoder to assist with task execution. Specifically, we design
a structured invocation template, including 1) Module name, 2) Invocation command, and 3) Region
(optional) specifying a fine-grained vision feature needed for certain tasks. The feature embeddings
include both task-specific features and task-invariant fine-grained features. The purpose of this design
is to achieve feature decoupling, during which we aim to have the task-invariant fine-grained features
shared as widely as possible among all tasks to facilitate synergy between different tasks.
4
Pixel-aware Synergistic Vision-Language Understanding Tuning
With the VITRON framework, we now train the model with three stages of targets. First, we try to
endow it with basic multimodal capabilities, i.e., comprehension and generation. Then, we engage in
fine-grained vision grounding instruction tuning to further enhance the model’s pixel-level perception
abilities. Finally, we carry out cross-task synergy learning, maximizing the shared fine-grained
features among all tasks.

4.1
Basic Multimodal Comprehension and Generation Skill Training
In the first stage of training, the primary goal is to equip the MLLM with basic multimodal under-
standing and generation abilities, including the frontend alignment of encoder-LLM, as well as the
backend alignment of LLM-decoder. Appendix §B.1 details all the following three types of training.
Overall Vision-Language Alignment Learning.
This is to ensure the input vision and language are
mapped to a unified feature space. Following prior common practice, we utilize datasets comprising
‘image-caption’ pairs (CC3M [89]), ‘video-caption’ pairs (Webvid [4]), and ‘region-caption’ pairs
(RefCOCO [40]) drawn from existing established corpora and benchmarks. When provided with an
image, video, or specific visual region, we engage the frozen LLM to generate a text description or
caption that aligns with the reference caption.
Text Invocation Instruction Tuning.
This step of training aims to equip the system with the precise
capability to execute commands, allowing the LLM to generate appropriate and correct invocation
text instructions. To accomplish this, we collect a total of 55,000+ instruction tuning samples.
Embedding-oriented Decoder Alignment Tuning.
Besides using explicit textual instruction to
invocate downstream modules, the signal feature embedding/representation (from LLM) should also
be fed to the modules. Following [114], we align the feature embedding with all the visual modules’
input encoders via the decoding-side projection layers, i.e., by minimizing their distances.

4.2
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Vision Grounding Instruction Tuning
A visual generalist should require a strong capability of pixel-aware vision understanding of both
images and videos. Thus, we propose a fine-grained spatiotemporal vision grounding instruction
tuning for VITRON. The core idea is to enable the LLM to ground the fine-grained spatiality of
images and the detailed temporality of videos. Appendix §B.2 extends more detailed descriptions of
the following three learning aspects.
Image Spatial Grounding.
Considering that the LLM alone can only output text, we design it
to respond with the corresponding bounding box areas. We focus on two types of tasks: grounded
image captioning [133, 137] and referring image segmentation [40].
Video Spatial-Temporal Grounding.
For videos, the LLM must identify spatial regions and
ground them within the temporal context of the video, essentially achieving video tracking. Similarly,
we explore tasks such as grounded video captioning [136] and referring video tracking [107].

The grounding
tasks mentioned above only touch upon the low-
level aspects of vision perception. However, in
many scenarios, it’s essential for the LLM to pos-
sess high-level, in-depth vision reasoning capabili-
ties, building upon the foundational low-level pixel
grounding. Thus, we further introduce grounding-
aware vision QA, including Image-QA [88, 37]
and Video-QA [124], enabling LLM to undertake
semantic-level QA tasks based on the grounded
results.

4.3
Cross-task Synergy Learning
As a generalist, directly invoking different specialists leads to a critical issue: how to ensure that
the different modules (tasks) work together synergistically? Otherwise, without such collaboration,

6


---Page Break---
integrating them into a single compound system would be meaningless. To achieve this, here we
propose decomposing the signal feature embeddings into task-specific features and task-invariant
fine-grained features. Intuitively, since all the visual tasks we focus on are fine-grained, the more
extensively the task-invariant fine-grained features are shared among different tasks, the more these
tasks can benefit from each other, thus gaining greater synergy. Thereafter, we introduce a cross-task
synergy learning module, as shown in Fig. 3. We employ adversarial training [3] to decouple
task-specific from task-invariant features. We first let different backbone visual specialists make task
predictions based on these two features (via concatenation). Meanwhile, we encourage a third-party
discriminator (acts as a classifier) to determine which is the current task based solely on the shared
feature representation. Ideally, once the discriminator can no longer accurately identify the task, the
shared feature can be considered the most purified and broadly applicable across tasks.

Experiments

Now we try to quantify the performance of VITRON on the four vision task groups, covering 12 tasks
across 22 datasets. All the training of VITRON is conducted on 10× A100 (80G) GPUs. To ensure a
fair comparison, all subsequent experiments adopt settings same/similar to those of baseline systems,
with evaluations following established practices. See more implementation details in Appendix §C.
Due to space limits, more experimental results are presented in Appendix §D.

the comparisons between VITRON and current state-of-the-art (SoTA) video MLLMs in video spatial
grounding. It is clear that VITRON significantly outperforms PG-Video-LLaVA. Table 4 presents a
comparison of VITRON with some SoTA systems in video tracking, where our system continues to
demonstrate superior performance.

shown in Tables 5 illustrate that VITRON surpasses the best baseline across various datasets and
metrics, proving its strong and accurate fine-grained semantic understanding of images.

The above two tasks focus solely on the model’s ability to recognize at the region level. Taking a step
further, we delve deeper into assessing the capability for image semantics understanding, particularly
through image-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. These tasks effectively reflect the
model’s proficiency in comprehending the deeper semantic content of images. Table 6 displays
the results across a series of six datasets for image-based VQA. We primarily compare two groups
of models: those with and without pixel-wise vision grounding capabilities. The findings indicate
that models equipped with fine-grained grounding abilities indeed show stronger task performance,
suggesting that fine-grained grounding contributes to a more profound understanding of semantics.
Notably, our VITRON achieves the highest performance among the models evaluated.

Region-level Video Understanding.
Similarly, for videos, we evaluate the Region-level Video
Understanding capability. Building on observations from images, we now directly engage in video QA
tasks. Table 7 presents the results on video QA across four representative datasets. Interestingly, while
PG-Video-LLaVA has video grounding capabilities, it does not show better results than Video-LLaVA,
which lacks grounding. However, our VITRON achieves superior performance. This indirectly proves
that our system possesses more accurate video grounding capabilities (as previously demonstrated in
Table 8), aiding in better video semantics understanding.

Next, we assess our system’s capabilities in vision generation, focusing on three of the most representa-
tive types of generation tasks: text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image-to-video
generation. These tasks broadly cover the spectrum of image generation requirements. Tables 8, 9,
and 10 showcase how our VITRON performs in comparison to other SoTA systems, including both
MLLM and non-MLLM synthesizers. The results clearly demonstrate that VITRON outperforms on
all three tasks. For instance, in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks, VITRON shows
more advanced performance compared to NExT-GPT. Similarly, in the image-to-video generation
task, VITRON still outshines the SoTA baseline, VideoCrafter1, showcasing superior results.

Results on Vision Editing
Image Editing.
We use the MagicBrush dataset [129], which challenges models with an editing
query that demands a series of complex edits to an image. These edits include removing, changing,
inpainting, and adding elements. Since there are currently no MLLM systems that support image
editing, our comparison is limited to non-LLM expert systems. In Table 11, we present the perfor-
mance of different models across various metrics. VITRON demonstrates stronger performance on all
metrics, indicating its stable image editing capabilities.

Video Editing.
For video editing, the community currently lacks a standardized benchmark and
evaluation method akin to those for image editing. Therefore, we opted for a manual evaluation
approach. We asked different video editing systems to edit the same video based on the same query,
after which five individuals were asked to score the edited videos. The evaluation focused on 1) the
success of target content modifications and 2) the faithfulness/fidelity of non-target content. Table 12
presents the manual evaluation results for video editing. It is clear that VITRON outperforms the two
baseline systems in both respects, showcasing superior video editing capabilities. Following this, we
visualized the process of video editing by VITRON.

Discussions

Above we demonstrate the overall efficacy of VITRON via extensive quantitative comparison. Now
we take one step further, exploring how and why the system advances via in-depth analyses.

▶Discrete Textual Instruction or Continuous Signal Embedding, Which Better?
Firstly, we
explore different message-passing mechanisms to determine whether discrete textual instruction
is more beneficial, or whether continuous signal embedding is better for building a multi-modal
generalist. Also, we validate the pros and cons of the proposed hybrid method of message passing. We
conduct tests on 6 tasks, where we compare the task performance of VITRON using the hybrid method
(default setting), without signal embedding and without text instruction, as well as the successful
execution rate of the backend task module. Fig. 4 presents the results. As can be observed, overall,
the performance under scenarios utilizing both methods is consistently better, which confirms the
effectiveness of our hybrid mode. Meanwhile, we find that the method of text instruction is more
conducive to the successful execution of backend modules, but soft feature embedding seems to be
more useful in terms of specific task performances.

▶How Much Does Each Fine-grained Visual Grounding Learning Contribute?
Next, we
validate the specific contribution of the various fine-grained visual grounding learning strategies
proposed in §4.2. Fig. 5 (the top 4 relate to image tasks, and the bottom 4 to video tasks) shows the
impact on performance when a particular learning strategy is removed. Generally, all these 3 types of
fine-grained visual grounding learning strategies are vital for different downstream tasks. For instance,
grounding and referring segmentation tasks directly influence fine-grained visual recognition tasks,
whereas tuning for grounding-aware visual QA considerably boosts cognition level QA tasks. This
verifies the efficacy of our proposed fine-grained visual grounding tuning strategies.

▶Does VITRON Really Achieve Cross-task Synergy?
Finally, we investigate if our system could
adequately support cross-task synergy. Based on the results of the ablation item for the ‘synergy

module’ in Table 2 to Table 12, we can observe that the synergy learning mechanism indeed positively
influences overall performance. In Fig. 6 we further study whether there is synergy between different
tasks and their collaborative relations. For ease of study, we considered a one-to-one mapping
relationship, studying the cooperation between pairs of tasks one at a time. It is evident that the
cooperative effects vary between different tasks. Tasks or backbone modules that rely more heavily
on fine-grained visual features gained more significant improvements. This also demonstrates that
our synergy learning module can successfully facilitate cross-task synergy.

Conclusion

In this work, we present VITRON, a grand unified pixel-level vision LLM for seamlessly understanding
(perceiving and reasoning), generating, segmenting (grounding and tracking), and editing (inpainting)
both images and videos. We further introduce a novel hybrid method of message passing that
combines discrete textual instructions with continuous signal embeddings to ensure precise function
invocation. Furthermore, VITRON employs pixel-level spatiotemporal vision-language alignment to
enhance its fine-grained visual capabilities. A cross-task synergy module is also developed to optimize
the use of task-invariant fine-grained visual features, boosting synergy across various visual tasks.
On 12 visual tasks across 22 datasets, VITRON exhibits extensive capabilities in visual segmentation,
fine-grained vision understanding, generation, and editing. Overall, this research showcases the great
potential to build a vision-language generalist that can advance toward a more unified AI.

Details of Backbone Visual Modules/Specialists

To address the inability of text-based LLMs in handling various vision tasks, we consider integrating
off-the-shelf external modules. Once the LLM generates invocation details through understanding
the input and recognizing the user’s intent, the corresponding modules are activated to produce
non-textual outputs. Technically, we employ a variety of current SoTA expert models for vision
processing. For image generation and editing, we integrate the diffusion-based model GLIGEN [57].
For image and video segmentation, we opt for SEEM [139]. For video generation, ZeroScope [8]
and I2VGen-XL [131] are utilized for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks, respectively. Lastly,
for video editing functionality, we incorporate StableVideo [9]. In Table 13, we summarize the
functionality of each backend module, along with a specification of the inputs and outputs.

Extensions of Pixel-aware Synergistic Vision-Language Understanding
Learning

This section extends more details of the §4 in the main article.

B.1
Baisc MLLM Skill Training
Overall Vision-Language Alignment Learning.
In line with the methodologies in current MLLMs,
our approach involves This step aims at mapping the input vision language features to a unified
feature space. This space creates representations that the central LLM can interpret, thereby enabling
it to process incoming vision signals effectively. We utilize datasets of ‘image-caption’ pairs (CC3M
[89]), ‘video-caption’ pairs (Webvid [4]), and ‘region-caption’ pairs (RefCOCO [40]) from existing
corpora. When provided with an image, video, or specific visual region, we engage the frozen LLM
to generate a text description or caption that aligns with the reference caption.

Invocation-oriented Instruction Tuning.
The above phase of training endows both the LLM
and the frontend encoders with the ability to understand vision. This step, instruction tuning for
invocation, aims to equip the system with the precise capability to execute commands, allowing the
LLM to generate appropriate and correct invocation text. This text is then used to trigger various
backend task execution modules. Different terminal vision tasks might require distinct invocation
commands. To unify this, we try to standardize the LLM’s response output into a structured text
format, which includes: 1) User response output, which directly replies to the user’s input. 2) Module
name, indicating which function or task is to be executed. 3) Invocation command, a meta-instruction
for triggering the task module. 4) Region (optional), specifying a fine-grained vision feature needed
for certain tasks, such as in video tracking or vision editing, where backend modules require this
information. For the region, based on LLM’s pixel-level understanding, a bounding box described by
the coordinates (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb) will be output. Following, we exemplify a video tracking example
for the structured LLM response for module invocation.

▶Structured LLM response for module invocation (with video tracking example):
Input:

Table 14: Feature summary of the constructed data for text invocation instruction tuning.
in image
segmentation means the reference image provided by users.
in video segmentation means the
intermediate referred video keyframe interpreted within the system.

To teach the LLM to produce the correct invocation responses, we need to create data for instruction
tuning. A key is ensuring that the data covers all possible scenarios. We must take into account
different ways users might interact with the system for each functionality mentioned in Table 13
(except for text generation). For example, when requesting video creation, a user might describe what
they want purely in text, or provide a reference image as the basis for the desired video. Similarly, for
editing images or videos, users could express their editing requests either through text, or by using
sketches, scribbles and other interactions. Thus, the LLM needs to be versatile in accepting various
types of user inputs and generating an accurate invocation response that matches the requirements
of the backend modules. Technically, we make use of the existing annotated datasets for various
vision tasks included in this work. For each task under specific different user input scenarios, with the
corresponding data, we design various template dialogue-format examples. Based on these examples
we then prompt the GPT-4 to generate more samples under various topics and enriched scenarios.
Finally, we collect a total of 55,000+ invocation-oriented instruction tuning samples. In Table 14 we
provide a summary of these datasets.

Embedding-oriented Decoder Alignment Tuning.
Besides using the explicit textual instruction to
invocate downstream modules, also the signal feature embedding/representation (from LLM) should
also be fed to the modules. Denote the task-specific features as vp and task-invariant fine-grained
features as vs. We will concatenate them as one unified feature embedding v = [vp; vs] and then
send v to the downstream module.

Following [114], we align the feature embedding with all the visual module’s input encoders via the
decoding-side projection layers. We do this feature alignment learning by minimizing the distance
between the projected feature embedding and the module’s input encoder. For example for diffusion-
based image or video generation, we may directly use the textual condition encoder, while keeping
all the other modules fixed. Technically, to endow the model to produce other modalities beyond text,
we add the signal tokens to the vocabulary of the LLM. In the alignment training phase, we mainly
take the captions from CC3M, WebVid, and AudioCaps as inputs and concatenate them with the
special signal tokens as outputs. The loss function comprises three key components: 1) the negative
log-likelihood of producing signal tokens, and 2) the caption alignment loss: l2-distance between the

20


---Page Break---
hidden states of signal tokens produced by the LLM and the conditional text representations derived
from the text encoder within diffusion models, and 3) conditional latent denoising loss [86].

B.2
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Vision Grounding Instruction Tuning

We propose a fine-grained spatiotemporal vision grounding instruction tuning for VITRON. The core
idea is to enable the LLM to ground the fine-grained spatiality of images and the detailed temporality
of videos. Technically, we leverage LoRA [35] to enable a small subset of parameters within the
LLM to be updated during the tuning.

Image Spatial Grounding.
Considering that the LLM alone can only output text, we design it to
respond with the corresponding bounding box areas. We focus on two types of tasks: grounded image
captioning and referring image segmentation. For grounded image captioning, we input an image and
identify a specific object within it, prompting the LLM to describe the identified object. Conversely,
for referring image segmentation (where we consider outputting a bounding box, akin to phrase
grounding), the task involves inputting a complete image along with a related phrase or sentence
description, and the LLM is expected to output the object’s spatial bounding box, represented by
coordinate numbers (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb). The X and Y coordinates are normalized real values within
the range [0, 1], where <Xl> and <Yt> indicate the top-left corner, and <Xr> and <Yb> represent
the bottom-right corner of the bounding box. We consider datasets such as Flickr30K Entities [79],
RefCOCO [40], RefCOCO+ [123] and RefCOCOg [68]. Utilizing GPT-4, we preprocess and expand
the original data into a multi-turn QA format, thereby generating the most suitable instruction-tuning
data.

▶Grounded Image Captioning:
Input:
Please generate a detailed caption for the given image,
and clearly link each part of the caption to specific ob-
jects or areas in the image which you can denote with a
bounding box with “object: (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb)” format.
Output:
A girl wearing a pink dress is sitting on a long bench in
the park reading a book.
girl: (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb),
pink dress: (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb), ...

▶Referring Image Segmentation:
Input:
Please identify the target object from
the given images based on the follow-
ing text query: “A man in a black shirt
holding a water bottle”.
Please output the bounding box (Xl,
Yt, Xr, Yb) of the target object.
Output:
(Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb)

Video Spatial-Temporal Grounding.
For videos, the LLM must not only identify spatial regions
but also ground these within the temporal context of the video, essentially achieving video tracking.
Similarly, we explore tasks such as grounded video captioning and referring video tracking. While
the approach is akin to that used for images, it requires not just the output of object bounding box
coordinates in each frame but also the specification of the duration of the frames (Fs, Fe) in which
these coordinates are to be outputted. Here <Fs> denotes the starting frame number, and <Fe> means
the ending frame number. We mainly construct the required instruction tuning data from several key
video tracking datasets: LaSOT [22], GOT10K [36], DanceTrack [95], and MOT16 [69].

▶Grounded Video Captioning:
Input:
Please generate a caption for the given video, and
link each part of the caption to specific objects in
the video with its temporal presence duration. You
should denote it with a bounding box with the start-
ing and ending frame number in format as “object:
(Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe)”.
Output:
A dog is running after a ball on the grass.
dog: (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe),
ball: (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe), ...

▶Referring Video Tracking:
Input:
Please track the specified object throughout
the video based on the following given de-
scription, and mark its starting and ending
position in each frame: “A man is skiing
on a thick-snow-covered slope.”
Please output in the format of “(Xl, Yt, Xr,
Yb | Fs, Fe)”.
Output:
(Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe)

Grounding-aware Vision QA.
The grounding tasks mentioned above only touch upon the low-
level aspects of vision perception. However, in many scenarios, it’s essential for the LLM to possess
high-level, in-depth vision reasoning capabilities, building upon the foundational low-level pixel
grounding. Therefore, we further introduce grounding-aware vision QA, enabling the LLM to
undertake semantic-level QA tasks based on the grounded results. Specifically, we consider both
image-grounded QA and video-grounded QA. The data sources for these tasks remain the same
as mentioned above for the grounding tasks. And we again rely on GPT-42 to use its imaginative
capabilities to design reasonable questions and answers based on the given grounding content of the
above grounding/segmentation datasets, formatting these into an instruction-tuning format.

▶Grounded Image QA:
Input:
Based on the given image, please se-
lect the correct answer among all the
candidates: Q: Where is the child sit-
ting? A: 1) arms, 2) ground, 3) chair,
4) bed.
Please first identify and ground the tar-
get object (in coordinates) mentioned
in the question, and then proceed to
answer the question.
Output:
The target object mentioned in the
question is "child," with the position
given by (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb). From this,
it can be determined that the child is
being held by a woman, which means
the child is sitting in the woman’s arms.
Therefore, the answer is 1) arms.

▶Grounded Video QA:
Input:
Based on the provided video, answer the following ques-
tion by choosing the most appropriate answer from the
options given. Q: If the rope in the video breaks, what
would happen to the person in the video? A: 1) running,
2) jumping up, 3) flying away, 4) fracture.
First, analyze the spatial position and temporality of the
target object mentioned in the question within the video,
and based on this analysis, determine the answer to the
question.
Output:
The objects involved in the question are the rope (Xl, Yt,
Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe) and the person (Xl, Yt, Xr, Yb | Fs, Fe),
with their relationship being that the person is climbing
with the assistance of the rope. Based on common sense,
if the rope were to break, the person would fall to the
ground from a height. The most likely outcome is that
the person would break a bone.

B.3
Cross-task Synergy Learning

Let’s denote the task-specific features as vp and task-invariant fine-grained features as vs. We will
concatenate them as one unified feature embedding v = [vp; vs] and then send v to the downstream
module Mk for the k-th task prediction:

yk ←M(v).
(1)

Although we separate the two feature spaces into the shared one vs and private one vp, there are still
chances that the learned shared and the private features are closely entangled, weakening the refining
of the shared task-invariant fine-grained feature. Therefore, we employ a third-party task discriminator
with adversarial training to refine the features. The discriminator D is a classifier for predicting what
the current task is, based merely on the task-invariant fine-grained feature representation vs. Ideally,
once the discriminator cannot accurately identify the task ID yd
k, the task-invariant fine-grained
feature representation vs can be understood as the most purified one. Specifically, the discriminator
is a 4-layer 768-d Transformer (Trm) network, where we use a feedforward layer (FFN) with Softmax
for the task prediction:

v
′ = Trm(v1, · · · , vn),
(2)

¯yd
k = Softmax(FFN(v
′)),
(3)

where ¯yd
k is the predicted task ID.

The target of this adversarial training is to urge the shared features such that the discriminator cannot
reliably predict the task ID:

Lsyn = minθ(maxD(
X

k
¯yd
k log(yd
k))).

Overall Training Remarks

All our framework is trained through three main stages, in a specific ordering of sub-steps:

• Step-1: Basic Multimodal Comprehension and Generation Skill Training, cf §4.1.

• Step-1.1: Aligning the encoder-LLM for overall vision-language alignment learning.
• Step-1.2: Doing text invocation instruction tuning such that the MLLM learns to output
text instructions in the correct format.
• Step-1.3: When the above step is converging, training the LLM with continuous soft
embedding-oriented LLM-decoder alignment, such that the LLM overall can convey
the signal to the downstream modules.

• Step-2: Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Vision Grounding Instruction Tuning, cf §4.2.

• Step-2.1: Starting by doing the Image Spatial Grounding training, on the grounded image
captioning task and referring image segmentation task.
• Step-2.2: When MLLM has the ability for fine-grained spatial understanding, doing the
Video Spatial-Temporal Grounding training, on the grounded video captioning task
and referring video tracking task.
• Step-2.3: When the MLLM has learned to have the competent ability of both image and
video spatiotemporal understanding at the perception level, doing the Grounding-aware
Vision QA task at the cognition level.

• Step-3: As the final step, when the overall system has learned to have a competitive ability in
various visual tasks, dining the cross-task synergy learning, cf §4.3. This should be done by
combining both the adversarial training (Lsyn) with the end-task prediction (Lk). So the
total loss of the step-3 is: Lsyn + P

k Lk.

C
Extended Experimental Settings

We quantify the performance of VITRON on a variety of standard benchmarks for downstream vision
tasks and compare it against some of the currently strong-performing systems. Given the countless
vision tasks within the community, our experiments focus only on 1-2 of the most representative tasks
from each task category for validation. To ensure a fair comparison, all subsequent experiments adopt
settings same or similar to those of baseline systems, with evaluations following established practices.
Before experiments, we perform targeted pre-training on all of VITRON’s backend modules (such as
GLIGEN and SEEM) on their respective datasets. This ensures our system is optimized for the best
possible performance during testing. Our approach centers on training the linear projection layers of
all encoders and efficiently fine-tuning the language model using LoRA.

Our backbone LLM is Vicuna3, 7B, version 1.5. The CLIP-ViT encoders for both images and videos
are with a patch size of 14, and convert all images and video frames into 336px resolutions. The task
discriminator in our synergy module is with a Transformer architecture, with 4 layers and each in
768-d representation. To train our model, we employ the AdamW optimizer along with a learning
rate scheduler. The pre-training of VITRON unfolds in three phases, all conducted on 10∼16 × A100
(80G) GPUs. Initially, we train the model using a global batch size of 128 and a maximum learning
rate of 3e-4, a process that takes approximately 40 hours. In the second tuning phase, we adjust the
model with a maximum learning rate of 1e-5, utilizing a global batch size of 90. This stage of training
lasts about 35 hours. The third phase of training employs a global batch size of 128 and maintains the
maximum learning rate of 1e-5, completing in roughly 10 hours.

Qualitative Studies of Case Visualizations

E.1
Vision Segmentation

Fig. 7 further demonstrates an example of how our VITRON processes image segmentation tasks
in an interactive manner with the user. When users sketch or doodle outlines on specific areas of
an image, VITRON is capable of accurately identifying the corresponding objects within the image.
Following this, it precisely generates the bounding box and mask area for the identified objects.

Fig. 8 also demonstrates the process of video segmentation. VITRON successfully identifies, localizes,
and tracks the target in the video based on the provided queries. Our system demonstrates a

24

remarkable ability to accurately and flexibly capture the user’s intent, even when the desired object to
be segmented is described in a highly implicit manner.

Fine-grained Vision Understanding

Fig. 9 highlights VITRON’s fine-grained visual understanding capabilities through regional image
captioning, to accurately understand and appropriately describe image regions.

Further, we showcase a visualization process illustrating how VITRON accomplishes fine-grained
visual understanding through video grounding tasks in Fig. 10. VITRON’s precise perception of
video details ensures a more accurate understanding of content semantics, leading to stronger video
understanding capabilities.

Vision Generation

Fig. 11 illustrates the process of vision generation across different modalities, including text, image,
and video. Initially, users start with a basic text command, and VITRON is capable of transforming a
simple idea into a detailed video. However, if users are not satisfied with the video generated directly
from text, they can first generate an image from text, then fine-tune or edit this image, and finally
create a satisfying video based on the adjusted image. Our VITRON, thanks to its robust interactive
capability via multi-turn dialogue, enables users to perform a series of consecutive operations,
ultimately facilitating smooth content creation. This fully helps meet the demands of real-world
application scenarios.

Vision Editing

Figure 13: Demonstration of video editing.

We showcase the specific process of this image editing, as illustrated in Fig. 12. VITRON is capable
of accepting different forms of user inputs (textual instruction or sketch) for precise image edits.
It maintains contextual consistency throughout a series of sequential editing operations, ultimately
achieving satisfactory results that meet the user’s expectations.

Fig. 13 illustrates this process. VITRON competently handles video editing tasks, including modifica-
tions to the content’s subject, and changes to the video’s style, etc.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: in the Section 1 & 2

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: in the Experiment part.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

28


---Page Break---
Justification: in the Section 3 & 4
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: in the Appendix A and Appendix C
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

29


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the data utilized in our experiments are publicly available. We will release
the code upon the acceptance of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: in the Appendix C
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: in the Section 5 and Appendix D, and All results are reported after the statistical
significance tests.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: in the Section C

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: the research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [No]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: the paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: the paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
