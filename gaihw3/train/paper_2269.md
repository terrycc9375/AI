Abstract

In the context of modern machine learning, models deployed in real-world scenar-
ios often encounter diverse data shifts like covariate and semantic shifts, leading to
challenges in both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and detection. Despite
considerable attention to these issues separately, a unified framework for theoretical
understanding and practical usage is lacking. To bridge the gap, we introduce a
graph-theoretic framework to jointly tackle both OOD generalization and detection
problems. By leveraging the graph formulation, data representations are obtained
through the factorization of the graph’s adjacency matrix, enabling us to derive
provable error quantifying OOD generalization and detection performance. Empir-
ical results showcase competitive performance in comparison to existing methods,
thereby validating our theoretical underpinnings. Code is publicly available at

Introduction

Machine learning models deployed in real-world applications often confront data that deviates
from the training distribution in unforeseen ways. As depicted in Figure 1, a model trained on
in-distribution (ID) data (e.g., seabirds) may encounter data exhibiting covariate shifts, such as birds
in forest environments. In this scenario, the model must retain its ability to accurately classify these
covariate-shifted out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as birds—an essential capability known as OOD
generalization [1, 2]. Alternatively, the model may encounter data with novel semantics, like dogs,
which it has not seen during training. In this case, the model must recognize these semantic-shifted
OOD samples and abstain from making incorrect predictions, underscoring the significance of OOD
detection [3, 4]. Thus, for a model to be considered robust and reliable, it must excel in both OOD
generalization and detection, tasks that are often addressed separately in current research.

Recently, Bai et al. [5] introduced a framework that addresses both OOD generalization and detection
simultaneously. The problem setting leverages unlabeled wild data naturally arising in the model’s
operational environment, representing it as a composite distribution of ID, covariate-shifted OOD,
and semantic-shifted OOD data. While such data is ubiquitously available in many real-world
applications, harnessing the power of wild data is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the wild
data distribution—the learner lacks clear membership (ID, Covariate-OOD, Semantic-OOD) for
samples drawn from the wild data distribution. Despite empirical progress made, a formalized
understanding of how wild data impacts OOD generalization and detection is still lacking.

In this paper, we formalize a graph-theoretic framework for understanding OOD generalization and
detection problems jointly. We begin by formulating a graph, where the vertices are all the data points
and edges connect similar data points. These edges are defined based on a combination of supervised

and self-supervised signals, incorporating both labeled ID data and unlabeled wild data. By modeling
the connectivity among data points, we can uncover meaningful sub-structures in the graph (e.g.,
covariate-shifted OOD data is embedded closely to the ID data, whereas semantic-shifted OOD data
is distinguishable from ID data). Importantly, this graph serves as a foundation for understanding
the impact of wild unlabeled data on both OOD generalization and detection, enabling a theoretical
characterization of performance through graph factorization. Within this framework, we derive a
formal linear probing error, quantifying the misclassification rate on covariate-shifted OOD data.
Furthermore, our framework yields a closed-form solution that quantifies the distance between ID
and semantic OOD data, directly elucidating OOD detection performance (Section 4).

Beyond theoretical analysis, our graph-theoretic framework can be used practically. In particular,
the spectral decomposition can be equivalently achieved by minimizing a surrogate objective, which
can be efficiently optimized end-to-end using modern neural networks. Thus, our approach enjoys
theoretical guarantees while being applicable to real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our graph-based approach, showcasing substantial improvements in both OOD
generalization and detection performance. In comparison to the state-of-the-art method Scone [5], our
approach achieves a significant reduction in FPR95 by an average of 8.34% across five semantic-shift
OOD datasets (Section 5). We summarize our main contributions below:

1. We introduce a graph-theoretic framework for understanding both OOD generalization and
detection, formalizing it by spectral decomposition of the graph containing ID, covariate-
shift OOD data, and semantic-shift OOD data.

2. We provide theoretical insights by quantifying OOD generalization and detection perfor-
mance through provable error, based on the closed-form representations derived from the
spectral decomposition on the graph.

3. We evaluate our model’s performance through a comprehensive set of experiments, providing
empirical evidence of its robustness and its alignment with our theoretical analysis. Our
model consistently demonstrates strong OOD generalization and OOD detection capabilities,
achieving competitive results when benchmarked against the existing state-of-the-art.

Problem Setup

We consider the empirical training set Dl ∪Du as a union of labeled and unlabeled data. The
labeled set Dl = {¯xi, yi}n
i=1, where yi belongs to known class space Yl. Let Pin denote the marginal
distribution over input space, which is referred to as the in-distribution (ID). Following Bai et al. [5],
the unlabeled set Du = {¯xi}m
i=1 consists of ID, covariate OOD, and semantic OOD data, where each
sample ¯xi is drawn from a mixture distribution defined below.

Definition 2.1. The marginal distribution of the wild data is defined as:

Pwild := (1 −πc −πs)Pin + πcPcovariate
out
+ πsPsemantic
out
,

where πc, πs, πc + πs ∈[0, 1]. Pin, Pcovariate
out
, and Psemantic
out
represent the marginal distributions of ID,
covariate-shifted OOD, and semantic-shifted OOD data respectively.

Learning goal. We aim to learn jointly an OOD detector gθ : X →{IN, OUT} and a multi-class
classifier fθ, by leveraging labeled ID data Dl and unlabeled wild data Du. Let ˆy(fθ(¯x)) :=
argmaxyf (y)
θ
(¯x), where f (y)
θ
(¯x) denotes the y-th element of fθ(¯x), corresponding to label y. We
notate gθ and fθ with parameters θ to indicate that these functions share neural network parameters.
In our model evaluation, we are interested in three metrics:
Definition 2.2. We define ID generalization accuracy (ID-Acc), OOD generalization accuracy
(OOD-Acc), and OOD detection error as follows:

↑ID-Acc(fθ) := E(¯x,y)∼Pin(1{by(fθ(¯x)) = y}),

↑OOD-Acc(fθ) := E(¯x,y)∼Pcovariate
out
(1{by(fθ(¯x)) = y}),

↓FPR(gθ) := E¯x∼Psemantic
out
(1{gθ(¯x) = IN}),

where 1{·} represents the indicator function, and the arrows indicate the directionality of improve-
ment (higher/lower is better). For OOD detection, ID samples are considered positive and FPR
signifies the false positive rate.

Graph-Based Framework for OOD Generalization and Detection

3.1
Graph Formulation

We start by formally defining the graph and adjacency matrix. We use ¯x to denote the set of all natural
data (raw inputs without augmentation). Given an ¯x, we use T (x|¯x) to denote the probability of x
being augmented from ¯x, and T (·|¯x) to denote the distribution of its augmentation. For instance,
when ¯x represents an image, T (·|¯x) can be the distribution of common augmentations [6] such as
Gaussian blur, color distortion, and random cropping. We define X as a general population space,
which contains the set of all augmented data. In our case, X is composed of augmented samples from
both labeled ID data Xl and unlabeled wild data Xu, with cardinality |X| = N.

We define the graph G(X, w) with vertex set X and edge weights w. Given our data setup, edge
weights w can be decomposed into two components: (1) self-supervised connectivity w(u) by treating
all points in X as entirely unlabeled, and (2) supervised connectivity w(l) by incorporating labeled
information from Xl to the graph. We define the connectivity formally below.

Definition 3.1 (Self-supervised connectivity). For any two augmented data x, x′ ∈X, w(u)
xx′ denotes
the marginal probability of generating the positive pair [7]:

w(u)
xx′ ≜E¯x∼PT (x|¯x)T (x′|¯x) ,
(1)

where x and x′ are augmented from the same image ¯x ∼P, and P is the marginal distribution of
both labeled and unlabeled data. A larger w(u)
xx′ indicates stronger similarity between x and x′.

Moreover, when having access to the labeling information for ID data, we can define the edge weight
by adding additional supervised connectivity to the graph. We consider (x, x′) a positive pair when x
and x′ are augmented from two labeled samples ¯xl and ¯x′
l with the same known class i ∈Yl. The
total edge connectivity can be formulated as below:

Definition 3.2 (Total edge connectivity). Considering both self-supervised and supervised connectiv-
ities, the overall similarity for any pair of data (x, x′) is formulated as:

wxx′ = ηuw(u)
xx′ + ηlw(l)
xx′, where w(l)
xx′ ≜
X

i∈Yl
E¯xl∼PliE¯x′
l∼PliT (x|¯xl)T (x′|¯x′
l) ,
(2)

where Pli is the distribution of labeled samples with class label i ∈Yl, and the coefficients ηu, ηl
modulate the relative importance between the two terms.

Adjacency matrix. Having established the notion of connectivity, we can define the adjacency matrix
A ∈RN×N with entries Axx′ = wxx′. The adjacency matrix can be decomposed into the summation
of self-supervised adjacency matrix A(u) and supervised adjacency matrix A(l):

A = ηuA(u) + ηlA(l).
(3)

3


---Page Break---
As a standard technique in graph theory [8], we use the normalized adjacency matrix:

˜A ≜D−1

2 AD−1

2 ,
(4)

where D ∈RN×N is a diagonal matrix with Dxx = wx = P

x′∈X wxx′, indicating the total edge
weights connected to a vertex x. The normalized adjacency matrix defines the probability of x and x′
being considered as the positive pair. The normalized adjacency matrix allows us to perform spectral
decomposition as we show next.

3.2
Learning Representations Based on Graph Spectral

In this section, we perform spectral decomposition or spectral clustering [9]—a classical approach to
graph partitioning—to the adjacency matrices defined above. This process forms a matrix where the
top-k eigenvectors are the columns and each row of the matrix can be viewed as a k-dimensional
representation of an example. The resulting feature representations enable us to rigorously analyze
the separability of ID data from semantic OOD data in a closed form, as well as the generalizability
to covariate-shifted OOD data (more in Section 4).

Towards this end, we consider the following optimization, which performs low-rank matrix approxi-
mation on the adjacency matrix:

min
F ∈RN×k Lmf(F, A) ≜
 ˜A −FF ⊤
2

F ,
(5)

where ∥· ∥F denotes the matrix Frobenious norm. According to the Eckart–Young–Mirsky theo-
rem [10], the minimizer of this loss function is Fk ∈RN×k such that FkF ⊤
k contains the top-k
components of ˜A’s eigen decomposition.

A surrogate objective.
In practice, directly solving objective (5) can be computationally expensive
for an extremely large matrix. To circumvent this, the feature representations can be equivalently
recovered by minimizing the following contrastive learning objective [11], which can be efficiently
trained end-to-end using a neural network:

L(f) ≜−2ηuL1(f) −2ηlL2(f) + η2
uL3(f) + 2ηuηlL4(f) + η2
l L5(f),

Importantly, this contrastive loss allows drawing a theoretical equivalence between learned repre-
sentations and the top-k singular vectors of ˜A, and facilitates theoretical understanding of the OOD
generalization and detection on the data represented by ˜A. The equivalence is formalized below.
Theorem 3.3 (Theoretical equivalence between two objectives). We define each row f ⊤
x of F as a
scaled version of learned feature embedding f : X 7→Rk, with fx = √wxf(x). Then minimizing
the loss function Lmf(F, A) in Equation 5 is equivalent to minimizing the surrogate loss in Equation 6.
Full proof is in Appendix A.

Interpretation for OOD generalization and detection. The loss learns feature representation jointly
from both labeled ID data and unlabeled wild data, so that meaningful structures emerge for both
OOD generalization and detection (e.g., covariate-shifted OOD data is embedded closely to the ID
data, whereas semantic-shifted OOD data is distinguishable from ID data). At a high level, the loss
components L1 and L2 contribute to pulling the embeddings of positive pairs closer, while L3, L4
and L5 push apart the embeddings of negative pairs. In particular, loss components on the positive
pairs can pull together samples sharing the same classes, thereby helping OOD generalization. At

4


---Page Break---
the same time, loss components on the negative pairs can help separate semantic OOD data in the
embedding space, thus benefiting OOD detection.

Difference from prior works. Spectral contrastive learning has been employed to analyze problems
such as self-supervised learning [7], unsupervised domain adaptation [12], novel category discov-
ery [13], open-world semi-supervised learning [11] etc. These works share the underlying loss form
by pulling together positive pairs and pushing away negative pairs. Despite the shared loss formu-
lation, our work has fundamentally distinct data setup and learning goals, which focus on the joint
OOD generalization and detection problems (cf. Section 2). We are interested in leveraging labeled
ID data to classify both unlabeled ID and covariate OOD data correctly into the known categories
while rejecting the remainder of unlabeled data from new categories, which was not studied in the
prior works. Accordingly, we derive a novel theoretical analysis for our setup and present empirical
verification uniquely tailored to our problem focus, which we present next.

Theoretical Analysis

In this section, we present a novel theoretical analysis of how the learned representations via graph
spectral can facilitate both OOD generalization and detection.

4.1
Analytic Form of Learned Representations

To obtain the representations, one can train the neural network f : X 7→Rk using the spectral
loss defined in Equation 6. Minimizing the loss yields representation Z ∈RN×k, where each row
vector zi = f(xi)⊤. According to Theorem 3.3, the closed-form solution for the representations is
equivalent to performing spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix. Thus, we have Fk =
√

DZ,
where FkF ⊤
k contains the top-k components of ˜A’s SVD decomposition and D is the diagonal matrix.
We further define the top-k singular vectors of ˜A as Vk ∈RN×k, so we have Fk = Vk
√Σk, where
Σk is a diagonal matrix of the top-k singular values of ˜A. By equalizing the two forms of Fk, the
closed-formed solution of the learned feature space is given by Z = [D]−1

2 Vk
√Σk.

4.2
Analysis Target

Linear probing evaluation. We assess OOD generalization performance based on the linear probing
error, which is commonly used in self-supervised learning [6]. Specifically, the weight of a linear
classifier is denoted as M ∈Rk×|Yl|, which is learned with ID data to minimize the error. The class
prediction for an input ¯x is given by h(¯x; f, M) = argmaxi∈Yl(f(¯x)⊤M)i. The linear probing error
measures the misclassification of linear head on covariate-shifted OOD data:

E(f) ≜E¯x∼Pcovariate
out
1[y(¯x) ̸= h(¯x; f, M)],
(7)

where y(¯x) indicates the ground-truth class of ¯x. E(f) = 0 indicates perfect OOD generalization.

Separability evaluation. Based on the closed-form embeddings, we can also quantify the distance
between the ID and semantic OOD data:

S(f) ≜E¯xi∼Pin,¯xj∼Psemantic
out
∥f(¯xi) −f(¯xj)∥2
2.
(8)

The magnitude of S(f) reflects the extent of separation between ID and semantic OOD data. Larger
S(f) suggests better OOD detection capability.

4.3
An Illustrative Example

Setup. We use an illustrative example to explain our theoretical insights. In Figure 2, the training
examples come from 5 types of data: angel in sketch (ID), tiger in sketch (ID), angel in painting
(covariate OOD), tiger in painting (covariate OOD), and panda (semantic OOD). The label space Yl
consists of two known classes: angel and tiger. Class Panda is considered a novel class. The goal is
to classify between images of angels and tigers while rejecting images of pandas.

Augmentation transformation probability. Based on the data setup, we formally define the
augmentation transformation, which encodes the probability of augmenting an original image ¯x

Main analysis.
We are primarily interested in analyzing the representation space derived from A.
We mainly put analysis on the top-3 eigenvectors bV ∈R5×3 and measure both the linear probing error
and separability. The full derivation of Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 can be found in Appendix D.1.

first case when the connection between the class (multiplied by 9

8) is stronger than the domain, the
model could learn a perfect ID classifier based on features in the first two rows in V and effectively
generalize to the covariate-shifted domain (the third and fourth row in bV ), achieving perfect OOD
generalization with linear probing error E(f) = 0. In the second case when the connection between
the domain is stronger than the connection between the class (scaled by 9

8), the embeddings of
covariate-shifted OOD data are identical, resulting in high OOD generalization error.

Interpretation. We analyze the function S(f) under dif-
ferent α′ and β′ values in Figure 3. Overall the distance
between semantic OOD data and ID data displays a large
value, which facilitates OOD detection. Note that a clear
boundary in Figure 3 indicates 9

More analysis. Building upon the understanding of both
OOD generalization and detection, we further discuss the
influence of different semantic OOD data in Appendix B,
and the impact of ID labels in Appendix C.

Experiments

Beyond theoretical insights, we show empirically that our approach is competitive. We present the
experimental setup in Section 5.1, results in Section 5.2, and further analysis in Section 5.3.

5.1
Experimental Setup

Datasets and benchmarks. Following the setup of [5], we employ CIFAR-10 [14] as Pin and
CIFAR-10-C [15] with Gaussian additive noise as the Pcovariate
out
. For Psemantic
out
, we leverage SVHN [16],
LSUN [17], Places365 [18], Textures [19]. To simulate the wild distribution Pwild, we adopt the
same mixture ratio as in Scone [5], where πc = 0.5 and πs = 0.1. Detailed descriptions of the
datasets and data mixture can be found in the Appendix E.1. To demonstrate the adaptability and
robustness of our proposed method, we extend the framework to more diverse and challenging
datasets. Large-scale results on the ImageNet dataset can be found in Appendix E.2. Additional
results on the Office-Home [20] can be found in Appendix E.3. More ablation studies can be found
in Appendix E.4.

Implementation details.
We adopt Wide ResNet with 40 layers and a widen factor of 2 [21].
We use stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum [22], with weight decay 0.0005 and
momentum 0.09. We divide CIFAR-10 training set into 50% labeled as ID and 50% unlabeled. And
we mix unlabeled CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and semantic OOD data to generate the wild dataset.
Starting from random initialization, we train the network with the loss function in Eq. 6 for 1000
epochs. The learning rate is 0.03 and the batch size is 512. ηu is selected within {1.00, 2.00}
and ηl is within {0.02, 0.10, 0.50, 1.00}. Subsequently, we follow the standard approach [12] and
use labeled ID data to fine-tune the model with cross-entropy loss for better generalization ability.
We fine-tune for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 0.005 and batch size of 512. The fine-tuned
model is used to evaluate the OOD generalization and OOD detection performance. We utilize a
distance-based method for OOD detection, which resonates with our theoretical analysis. Specifically,
our default approach employs a simple non-parametric KNN distance [23], which does not impose
any distributional assumption on the feature space. The threshold is determined based on the clean ID
set at 95% percentile. For further implementation details, hyper-parameters, and validation strategy,
please see Appendix F.

5.2
Results and Discussion

Competitive empirical performance. The main results in Table 1 demonstrate that our method not
only enjoys theoretical guarantees but also exhibits competitive empirical performance compared to
existing baselines. For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider three groups of methods for OOD
generalization and OOD detection. Closest to our setting, we compare with strong baselines trained
with wild data, namely OE [36], Energy-regularized learning [26], Woods [37], and Scone [5].

The empirical results provide interesting insights into the performance of various methods for OOD
detection and generalization. (1) Methods tailored for OOD detection tend to capture the domain-
variant information and struggle with the covariate distribution shift, resulting in suboptimal OOD
accuracy. (2) While approaches for OOD generalization demonstrate improved OOD accuracy,
they cannot effectively distinguish between ID data and semantic OOD data, leading to poor OOD
detection performance. (3) Methods trained with wild data emerge as robust OOD detectors, yet
display a notable decline in OOD generalization, highlighting the confusion introduced by covariate

Table 2: Comparison with spectral learning methods.

Better adaptation to the heterogeneous
distribution.
We conduct a compar-
ative analysis of our methods against
other state-of-the-art spectral learning
approaches within their respective do-
mains. Specifically, Haochen et al. [7] in-
vestigate unsupervised learning, Shen et
al. [12] delve into unsupervised domain
adaptation, and Sun et al. [13] explores
novel class discovery. The baseline meth-
ods all assume unlabeled data exhibits a
homogeneous distribution, either entirely
from Pcovariate
out
in the case of unsupervised domain adaptation or entirely from Psemantic
out
in the case
of novel class discovery. As depicted in Table 2, our results reveal a significant improvement over
competing baselines on both OOD generalization and detection. We attribute this empirical success
to our better adaptation to the heterogeneous mixture of wild distributions. Additional results can be
found in Table 6. More ablation studies can be found in Appendix E.4.

5.3
Further Analysis

Visualization of OOD detection score distributions. In Figure 4 (a), we visualize the distribution of
KNN distances. The KNN scores are computed based on samples from the test set after contrastive
training and fine-tuning stages. There are two salient observations: First, our learning framework
effectively pushes the semantic OOD data to be apart from the ID data in the embedding space, which
benefits OOD detection. Moreover, as evidenced by the small KNN distance, covariate-shifted OOD
data is embedded closely to the ID data, which aligns with our expectations.

Visualization of embeddings.
Figure 4 (b) displays the t-SNE [38] visualization of the normalized
penultimate-layer embeddings. Samples are from the test set of ID, covariate OOD, and semantic
OOD data, respectively. The visualization demonstrates the alignment of ID and covariate OOD
data in the embedding space, which allows the classifier learned on the ID data to extrapolate to the
covariate OOD data thereby benefiting OOD generalization.

Related Works

Out-of-distribution detection. OOD detection has gained soaring research attention in recent years.
The current research track can be divided into post hoc and regularization-based methods. Post hoc
methods derive OOD scores at test-time based on a pre-trained model, which can be categorized
as confidence-based methods [39, 24, 40], energy-based methods [26, 41, 42, 43, 44, 29], distance-
based methods [45, 46, 47, 23, 48, 49, 50], and gradient-based method [51]. On the other hand,
regularization-based methods aim to train the OOD detector by training-time regularization. Most
approaches require auxiliary OOD data [52, 53, 54, 36, 55, 56, 57]. However, a limitation of existing
methods is the reliance on clean semantic OOD datasets for training. To address this challenge,
WOODS [37] first explored the use of wild data, which includes unlabeled ID and semantic OOD
data. Building upon this idea, SCONE [5] extended the characterization of wild data to encompass ID,
covariate OOD, and semantic OOD data, providing a more generalized data mixture in practice. In
our paper, we provide a novel graph-theoretic approach for understanding both OOD generalization
and detection based on the setup proposed by Scone [5].

Out-of-distribution generalization.
OOD generalization aims to learn domain-invariant repre-
sentations that can effectively generalize to unseen domains, which is more challenging than classic
domain adaptation problem [58, 59, 60, 61], where the model has access to unlabeled data from
the target domain. OOD generalization and domain generalization [62] focus on capturing seman-
tic features that remain consistent across diverse domains, which can be categorized as reducing
feature discrepancies across the source domains [63, 64, 31, 65, 66, 67], ensemble and meta learn-
ing [68, 69, 70, 71, 72], robust optimization [73, 74, 75, 76, 77], augmentation [78, 79, 80, 81], and
disentanglement [82]. Distinct from prior literature about generalization, Scone [5] introduces a
framework that leverages the wild data ubiquitous in the real world, aiming to build a robust classifier
and a reliable OOD detector simultaneously. Following the same problem setting in [5], we contribute
novel theoretical insights into the understanding of both OOD generalization and detection.

Spectral graph theory.
Spectral graph theory is a classical research field [8, 83, 84, 85, 86],
concerning the study of graph partitioning through analyzing the eigenspace of the adjacency matrix.
The spectral graph theory is also widely applied in machine learning [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. Recently,
Haochen et al. [7] presented unsupervised spectral contrastive loss derived from the factorization of
the graph’s adjacency matrix. Shen et al. [12] provided a graph-theoretic analysis for unsupervised
domain adaptation based on the assumption of unlabeled data entirely from Pcovariate
out
. Sun et al. [13]
first introduced the label information and explored novel category discovery, considering unlabeled
data covers Psemantic
out
. All of the previous literature assumed unlabeled data has a homogeneous
distribution. In contrast, our work focuses on the joint problem of OOD generalization and detection,
tackling the challenge of unlabeled data characterized by a heterogeneous mixture distribution, which
is a more general and complex scenario than previous works.

Contrastive learning.
Recent works on contrastive learning advance the development of deep
neural networks with a huge empirical success [6, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101]. Simultane-
ously, many theoretical works establish the foundation for understanding representations learned by
contrastive learning through linear probing evaluation [102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107]. Haochen et

9


---Page Break---
al. [7, 108], Sun et al. [13] extended the understanding and providing error analyses for different
downstream tasks. Orthogonal to prior works, we provide a graph-theoretic framework tailored for
the wild environment to understand both OOD generalization and detection.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a graph-theoretic framework to jointly tackle both OOD generalization
and detection problems. Based on the graph formulation, the data representations can be derived
by factorizing the graph’s adjacency matrix, allowing us to draw theoretical insight into both OOD
generalization and detection performance. In particular, we analyze the closed-form solutions of
linear probing error for OOD generalization, as well as separability quantifying OOD detection
capability via the distance between the ID and semantic OOD data. Empirically, our framework
demonstrates competitive performance against existing baselines, closely aligning with our theoretical
insights. We anticipate that our theoretical framework and findings will inspire further research in
unifying and understanding both OOD generalization and detection.

Broader Impact

In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, addressing the dual challenges of OOD
generalization and detection has become paramount for deploying robust and reliable models in
real-world scenarios. Our work provides a novel spectral learning solution, which not only improves
model performance but also ensures its reliability and safety in diverse, dynamic environments. The
implications of our research extend beyond theoretical advancements, with potential applications
in healthcare, autonomous systems, and finance. The ability to deploy models with superior OOD
generalization and detection capabilities addresses a critical bottleneck in the adoption of machine
learning technologies, fostering trust among end-users and stakeholders.

Limitations

In our experimental setup, we focus on covariate shift as the primary form of shift in the out-of-
distribution (OOD) generalization problem, a topic extensively explored in the literature. However,
it’s important to acknowledge the existence of other types of distributional shifts (e.g., concept shift),
which we defer for future investigation.

Figure 5: Illustration of 5 nodes graph and the augmentation
probability defined by classes and domains. Figure (a) illus-
trates the scenario where semantic OOD data has a different
domain from covariate OOD. Figure (b) depicts the case
where semantic OOD and covariate OOD share the same
domain.

In our main analysis in Section 4, we
consider semantic OOD to be from
a different domain. Alternatively, in-
stances of semantic OOD data can
come from the same domain as covari-
ate OOD data. In this section, we pro-
vide a complete picture by contrasting
these two cases.

Setup. In Figure 5, we illustrate two
scenarios where the semantic OOD
data has either a different or the same
domain label as covariate OOD data.
Other setups are the same as Sec. 4.3.

Adjacency matrix. The adjacency
matrix for scenario (a) has been de-
rived in Eq. 11. For the alternative
scenario (b) where semantic OOD
shares the same domain as the covari-
ate OOD, we can derive the analytic form of adjacency matrix A1.

row or column encodes connectivity associated with a specific sample, ordered by: angel sketch,
tiger sketch, angel painting, tiger painting, and panda. We refer readers to the Appendix D.2 for the
detailed derivation.

Main analysis. Following the same assumption in Sec. 4.3, we are primarily interested in analyzing
the difference of the representation space derived from A and A1 and put analysis on the top-3
eigenvectors bV1 ∈R5×3.

3α′
. R is a diagonal matrix

that normalizes the eigenvectors to unit norm and bλ2, bλ3 are the 2nd and 3rd highest eigenvalues.

Interpretation. When semantic OOD shares the same domain as covariate OOD, the OOD gen-
eralization error E(f1) can be reduced to 0 as long as α and β are positive. This generalization
ability shows that semantic OOD and covariate OOD sharing the same domain could benefit OOD
generalization. We empirically verify our theory in Section E.4.

Interpretation. If α′, β′ ∈black area in Figure 6 (b) and semantic OOD comes from a different
domain, this would increase the separability between ID and semantic OOD, which benefits OOD
detection. If α′, β′ ∈white area in Figure 6 (b) and semantic OOD comes from a different domain,
this would impair OOD detection.

C
Impacts of ID Labels on OOD Generalization and Detection

Compared to spectral contrastive loss proposed by Haochen et al. [7], we utilize ID labels in the
pre-training. In this section, we analyze the impacts of ID labels on the OOD generalization and
detection performance.

Following the same assumption in Sec. 4.3, we are primarily interested in analyzing the difference
of the representation space derived from A and A(u) and put analysis on the top-3 eigenvectors
bV (u) ∈R5×3. Detailed derivation can be found in the Appendix D.3.

, E(f (u)) =

, if α > β;
2
, if α < β.
(18)

Interpretation. By comparing the eigenvectors bV in the supervised case (Theorem 4.1) and the
eigenvectors bV (u) in the self-supervised case, we find that adding ID label information transforms
the performance condition from α = β to 9

8α = β. In particular, the discussion can be divided
into two cases: (1) α > β. (2) α < β. In the first case when the connection between the class is
stronger than the domain, the model could learn a perfect ID classifier based on features in the first
two rows in bV (u) and effectively generalize to the covariate-shifted domain (the third and fourth
row in bV (u)), achieving perfect OOD generalization with E(f (u)) = 0. In the second case when the
connection between the domain is stronger than the connection between the class, the embeddings of
covariate-shifted OOD data are identical, resulting in high OOD generalization error.

Theorem C.2. Assume ηu = 5, ηl = 1, we have:

S(f) −S(f (u)) > 0, if α > 0, β > 0
(19)

Interpretation. After incorporating ID label information, the separability between ID and semantic
OOD in the learned embedding space increases as long as α and β are positive. This suggests that ID
label information indeed helps OOD detection. We empirically verify our theory in Section E.4.

Augmentation Transformation Probability. Recall the augmentation transformation probability,

Each row or column encodes augmentation connectivity associated with a specific sample, ordered

Details for A(u) and A(l). Recall that the self-supervised connectivity is defined in Eq. 1. Since we
have a 5-nodes graph, A(u) would be 1

5T T ⊤. If we assume ηu = 5, we can derive the closed-form
self-supervised adjacency matrix:

ηuA(u) =





ρ2 + β2 + α2 + 2γ2
2ρβ + γ2 + 2γα



Then, according to the supervised connectivity defined in Eq. 2, we only compute ID-labeled data.
Since we have two known classes and each class contains one sample, A(l) = T:,1T ⊤
:,1 + T:,2T ⊤
:,2.
Then if we let ηl = 1, we can have the closed-form supervised adjacency matrix:

Dataset Statistics

We provide a detailed description of the datasets used in this work below:

CIFAR-10 [14] contains 60, 000 color images with 10 classes. The training set has 50, 000 images
and the test set has 10, 000 images.

ImageNet-100 consists of a subset of 100 categories from ImageNet-1K [109]. This dataset contains
the following classes: n01498041, n01514859, n01582220, n01608432, n01616318, n01687978, n01776313,

CIFAR-10-C is generated based on Hendrycks et al. [15], applying different corruptions on CIFAR-
10 including gaussian noise, defocus blur, glass blur, impulse noise, shot noise, snow, and zoom
blur.

ImageNet-100-C is generated with Gaussian noise added to ImageNet-100 dataset [109].

SVHN [16] is a real-world image dataset obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
This dataset 73, 257 samples for training, and 26, 032 samples for testing with 10 classes.

Places365 [18] contains scene photographs and diverse types of environments encountered in the
world. The scene semantic categories consist of three macro-classes: Indoor, Nature, and Urban.

LSUN-C [17] and LSUN-R [17] are large-scale image datasets that are annotated using deep learning
with humans in the loop. LSUN-C is a cropped version of LSUN and LSUN-R is a resized version of
the LSUN dataset.

Textures [19] refers to the Describable Textures Dataset, which contains a large dataset of visual
attributes including patterns and textures. The subset we used has no overlap categories with the
CIFAR dataset [14].

iNaturalist [110] is a challenging real-world dataset with iNaturalist species, captured in a wide
variety of situations. It has 13 super-categories and 5,089 sub-categories. We use the subset from
Huang et al. [111] that contains 110 plant classes that no category overlaps with IMAGENET-
1K [109].

Office-Home [20] is a challenging dataset, which consists of 15500 images from 65 categories. It is
made up of 4 domains: Artistic (Ar), Clip-Art (Cl), Product (Pr), and Real-World (Rw).

Details of data split for OOD datasets.
For datasets with standard train-test split (e.g., SVHN),
we use the original test split for evaluation. For other OOD datasets (e.g., LSUN-C), we use 70% of
the data for creating the wild mixture training data as well as the mixture validation dataset. We use
the remaining examples for test-time evaluation. For splitting training/validation, we use 30% for
validation and the remaining for training. During validation, we could only access unlabeled wild
data and labeled clean ID data, which means hyper-parameters are chosen based on the performance
of ID Acc. on the ID validation set (more in Section F).

Results on ImageNet-100

In this section, we present results on the large-scale dataset ImageNet-100 to further demonstrate our
empirical competitive performance. We employ ImageNet-100 as Pin, ImageNet-100-C as Pcovariate
out
,
and iNaturalist [110] as Psemantic

training set into 50% labeled as ID and 50% unlabeled. Then we mix unlabeled ImageNet-100,
ImageNet-100-C, and iNaturalist to generate the wild dataset. We include results from Scone [5] and
set πc = 0.5, πs = 0.1 for consistency. We pre-train the backbone ResNet-34 [112] with spectral
contrastive loss and then use ID data to fine-tune the model. We set the pre-training epoch as 100,
batch size as 512, and learning rate as 0.01. For fine-tuning, we set the learning rate to 0.01, batch
size to 128, and train for 10 epochs. Empirical results in Table 4 indicate that our method effectively
balances OOD generalization and detection while achieving strong performance in both aspects.
While Wood [37] displays strong OOD detection performance, the OOD generation performance
(44.46%) is significantly worse than ours (72.58%). More detailed implementation can be found in
Appendix F.

Results on Office-Home

In this section, we present empirical results on the Office-Home [20], a dataset comprising 65
object classes distributed across 4 different domains: Artistic (Ar), Clipart (Cl), Product (Pr), and
Real-World (Rw). Following OSBP [113], we separate 65 object classes into the first 25 classes in
alphabetic order as ID classes and the remainder of classes as semantic OOD classes. Subsequently,
we construct the ID data from one domain (e.g., Ar) across 25 classes, and the covariate OOD from
another domain (e.g., Cl) to carry out the OOD generalization task (e.g., Ar →Cl). The semantic
OOD data are from the remainder of classes, in the same domain as covariate OOD data. We consider
the following wild data, where Pwild = πcPcovariate
out
+ πsPsemantic
out
and πc + πs = 1. This setting is also
known as open-set domain adaptation [114], which can be viewed as a special case of ours.

For a fair empirical comparison, we include results from Anna [115], containing comprehensive
baselines like STA [116], OSBP [113], DAOD [117], OSLPP [118], ROS [119], and Anna [115].

Following previous literature, we use OOD Acc. to denote the average class accuracy over known
classes only in this section. We employ ResNet-50 [112] as the default backbone. As shown in Table 5,
our approach strikes a balance between OOD generalization and detection, even outperforming
the state-of-the-art method Anna in terms of FPR by 11.3% on average. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method in handling the complex OOD scenarios present in the Office-Home
dataset. More detailed implementation can be found in Appendix F.

Ablation Study

Better adaptation to the heterogeneous distribution. As presented in Table 6, the results underscore
our competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art spectral learning approaches within their
respective domains. For a fair comparison, SCL [7, 12] is purely unsupervised pre-trained on Dl ∪Du,
where Dl represents the labeled set, and Du denotes the unlabeled wild set. NSCL [13] undergoes
unsupervised pre-training on Du and supervised pre-training on Dl.

The improvement over SCL [7, 12] in both OOD generalization and detection illustrates the tremen-
dous help given by labeled information, which also perfectly aligns with our theoretical insights in
Appendx C. The comparison with NSCL [13] indicates that unsupervised pre-training on Dl ∪Du can
contribute to the adaptation to the heterogeneous wild distribution, thereby establishing the generality
of our method.

Impact of semantic OOD data. Table 7 empirically verifies the theoretical analysis in Section B. We
follow Cao et al. [120] and separate classes in CIFAR-10 into 50% known and 50% unknown classes.
To demonstrate the impacts of semantic OOD data on generalization, we simulate scenarios when
semantic OOD shares the same or different domain as covariate OOD. Empirical results in Table 7
indicate that when semantic OOD shares the same domain as covariate OOD, it could significantly
improve the performance of OOD generalization.

We use SGD optimizer with weight decay 5e-4 and momentum 0.9 for all the experiments. In

The learning rate (lr) is 0.030, batch size (bs) is 512. Then we use ID-labeled data to fine-tune for
20 epochs with lr 0.005 and bs 512. In ImageNet-100 experiments, we train ImageNet pre-trained
ResNet-34 for 100 epochs. The lr is 0.01, bs is 512. Then we fine-tune for 10 epochs with lr 0.01 and
bs 128. In Office-Home experiments, we use ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 with lr 0.001 and bs 64.
We use the same data augmentation strategies as SimSiam [98]. We set K in KNN as 50 in CIFAR-10
experiments and 100 in ImageNet-100 experiments, which is consistent with Sun et al. [23]. And ηu
is selected within {1.00, 2.00} and ηl is within {0.02, 0.10, 0.50, 1.00}. In Office-Home experiments,
we set K as 5, ηu as 3, and ηl within {0.01, 0.05}. ηu, ηl are summarized in Table 8.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have clearly claimed our contributions and scope in the abstract and
introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix 9.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

30


---Page Break---
Justification: Please refer to Appendix A and D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the Section 5.1 and Appendix F.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification:
Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/
Anonymous-7FD1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the Section 5.1 and Appendix E.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the standard deviation in our main experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide details regarding the hardware specifications in Appendix F.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the Appendix 8.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Existing assets have been properly credited and mentioned.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

34

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
