Abstract

In this paper, we introduce DCDepth, a novel framework for the long-standing
monocular depth estimation task. Moving beyond conventional pixel-wise depth
estimation in the spatial domain, our approach estimates the frequency coefficients
of depth patches after transforming them into the discrete cosine domain. This
unique formulation allows for the modeling of local depth correlations within each
patch. Crucially, the frequency transformation segregates the depth information
into various frequency components, with low-frequency components encapsulating
the core scene structure and high-frequency components detailing the finer aspects.
This decomposition forms the basis of our progressive strategy, which begins with
the prediction of low-frequency components to establish a global scene context,
followed by successive refinement of local details through the prediction of higher-
frequency components. We conduct comprehensive experiments on NYU-Depth-
V2, TOFDC, and KITTI datasets, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance
of DCDepth. Code is available at https://github.com/w2kun/DCDepth.

Introduction

Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a cornerstone topic within computer vision communities,
tasked with predicting the distance–or depth–of each pixel’s corresponding object from the camera
based solely on single image. As a pivotal technology for interpreting 3D scenes from 2D representa-
tions, MDE is extensively applied across various fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, and
3D modeling [45, 49, 9, 43], etc. However, MDE is challenged by the inherent ill-posed nature of
inferring 3D structures from 2D images, making it a particularly daunting task for traditional method-
ologies, which often hinge on particular physical assumptions or parametric models [40, 59, 31, 32].

Over the past decade, the field of computer vision has witnessed a substantial surge in the integration
of deep learning techniques. Many studies have endeavored to harness the robust learning capabilities
of end-to-end deep neural networks for MDE task, propelling the estimation accuracy to new heights.
Researchers have investigated a variety of methodologies, including regression-based [11, 19, 55],
classification-based [5, 12], and classification-regression based approaches [3, 20], to predict depth
on a per-pixel basis within the spatial domain. Despite these significant strides in enhancing accuracy,
current methods encounter two primary limitations: the first is the tendency to predict depth for
individual pixels in isolation, thus neglecting the crucial local inter-pixel correlations. The second
limitation is the reliance on a singular forward estimation process, which may not sufficiently capture
the complexities of 3D scene structures, thereby constraining their predictive performance.

To address the identified limitations, we propose to transfer depth estimation from the spatial domain
to the frequency domain. Instead of directly predicting metric depth values, our method focuses
on estimating the frequency coefficients of depth patches transformed using the Discrete Cosine

the DCT coefficients for each S × S depth patches. The prediction follows a global-to-local strategy,
starting with the initial estimation of lower-frequency components to capture the global scene structure.
Subsequently, higher-frequency components are estimated to enhance the local details, while the
lower-frequency estimates are refined. The estimation is carried out at H

S resolution, and
spatial-domain estimation is achieved through inverse DCT.

Transform (DCT) [2, 6]. This strategy offers dual benefits: firstly, the DCT’s basis functions in-
herently capture the inter-pixel correlations within depth patches, thereby facilitating the model’s
learning of local structures. Secondly, the DCT decomposes depth information into distinct fre-
quency components, where low-frequency components reflect the overall scene architecture, and
high-frequency components capture intricate local details. This dichotomy underpins our progressive
estimation methodology, which commences with the prediction of low-frequency coefficients to
grasp the macroscopic scene layout, subsequently refining the local geometries by inferring higher-
frequency coefficients predicated on previous predictions. The spatial depth map is then accurately
reconstructed via the inverse DCT. We illustrate this progress in Fig. 1. To implement our pro-
gressive estimation, we introduce a Progressive Prediction Head (PPH) that conditions on previous
predictions from both spatial and frequency domains, and facilitates the sequential prediction of
higher-frequency components using a GRU-based mechanism. Furthermore, recognizing the DCT’s
energy compaction property–indicative of the concentration of signal data within low-frequency
components–we introduce a DCT-inspired downsampling technique to mitigate information loss
during the downsampling process. This technique is embedded within a Pyramid Feature Fusion
(PFF) module, ensuring effective fusion of multi-scale image features for accurate depth estimation.

Our contributions can be succinctly summarized in three key aspects:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate MDE as a progressive regression
task in the discrete cosine domain. Our proposed method not only models local correlations
effectively but also enables global-to-local depth estimation.
• We introduce a framework called DCDepth, comprising two novel modules: the PPH module
progressively estimates higher-frequency coefficients based on previous predictions, and the
PFF module incorporates a DCT-based downsampling technique to mitigate information loss
during downsampling and ensures effective integration of multi-scale features.
• We evaluate our approach through comprehensive experiments on NYU-Depth-V2 [36], TOFDC
[52], and KITTI [13] datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of DCDepth
compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Related Work

Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) remains a central theme in computer vision, essential for
translating 2D imagery into 3D scene geometry. The evolution of MDE has been markedly influenced
by the integration of deep neural networks. A foundational advancement was introduced by Eigen et
al. [11], who developed a multi-scale deep convolutional network architecture, comprising a global
network for coarse depth prediction and a local network for refinement. They also introduced a
scale-invariant loss function to address the scale ambiguity challenge inherent in MDE. Building on

---Page Break---
this, subsequent researches [19, 56, 42, 51, 50, 57, 53] have adopted end-to-end regression approaches
with deep convolutional networks to further tackle MDE’s challenges.

However, inferring depth from a single image is intrinsically problematic due to the countless
potential depth maps that can correspond to one image. To mitigate this, additional information and
constraints have been incorporated into the MDE task, such as semantics [44, 60] and surface normals
[28, 33]. Further enhancements in depth estimation accuracy have been achieved through attention
mechanisms [14, 47, 30], multivariate gaussian modeling [21], internal discretization technique [27]
and pretraining [48, 46]. In contrast to the regression-based approach, some works [12, 5] have
conceptualized MDE as a classification task, estimating the probability distribution of depth values.
Yet, these methods often produce discontinuities due to discrete depth outputs. To overcome this,
alternative strategies [3, 20, 4, 34] have combined classification and regression formulations, learning
probabilistic distributions and employing linear combinations with depth candidates for final depth
predictions. Our methodology diverges from these paradigms by progressively estimating frequency
coefficients for depth patches after their transformation into the discrete cosine domain. This approach
not only enhances computational efficiency but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method

In this section, we introduce our progressive depth estimation framework, DCDepth. We begin
by providing an overview of the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as essential background
knowledge. Subsequently, we delve into the progressive estimation scheme and elaborate on the
network architecture. Finally, we present the loss function employed for training our model.

3.1
Reviewing 2D Discrete Cosine Transform

The 2D DCT is a mathematical technique used to decompose 2D discrete signals, such as depth maps
and feature maps, into a sum of cosine basis functions with varying frequencies. The basis functions
are defined as follows:

Bi,j
u,v = α(u)α(v) cos
 π

W


i + 1

2


u

cos
 π

H


j + 1

2


v

,
(1)

where u ∈[0, W −1] and v ∈[0, H −1] represent the frequency indices, i ∈[0, W −1] and
j ∈[0, H −1] denote the signal indices, and W and H indicate the input resolution. The terms
α(u) and α(v) correspond to normalization factors. The forward process of 2D DCT, denoted
as T(·), transforms the input signal x ∈RH×W in the spatial domain to the frequency spectrum
f = T(x), f ∈RH×W , and can be expressed as:

fu,v =

W −1
X

i=0

H−1
X

j=0
xi,jBi,j
u,v.
(2)

The resulting f is a matrix with the same size as the input x, with low-frequency components located
near the top-left corner and high-frequency components near the bottom-right corner. The upper
left one with zero frequency is called the DC components, and the remains are AC components.
Low-frequency components typically characterize smooth regions, while high-frequency components
capture edges or fine details where signal values change rapidly. The inverse 2D DCT, denoted as
T −1(·), performs the reverse operation by transforming the frequency spectrum f back to the spatial
domain x = T −1(f), and can be formulated as:

xi,j =

W −1
X

u=0

H−1
X

v=0
fu,vBi,j
u,v.
(3)

The DCT has two desirable advantages. Firstly, it operates in the real number domain, simplifying
the data processing. Secondly, it exhibits superior energy compaction properties by concentrating the
majority of information within a small number of low-frequency components.

3.2
Progressive Estimation in Discrete Cosine Domain

Estimating depth from a single image remains a challenging task, particularly for scenes with intricate
geometry. To tackle this, we propose a progressive method based on 2D DCT to estimate scene depth

estimation results to illustrate our progressive estimation scheme.

progressively from a global perspective down to local details. The entire process is illustrated in Fig.
1. We denote the input image as I ∈R3×H×W . Our proposed method, symbolized as Ψ(·), predicts
the frequency coefficients C ∈RS2× H

S × W

S for non-overlapping depth patches P ∈RS×S, where
S is set to 8 in our framework. These coefficients are subsequently transformed back to the spatial
domain ˆD ∈RH×W using the inverse 2D DCT, as expressed by

ˆD = T −1(Ψ(I)).
(4)

The separation of low- and high-frequency components in a depth map effectively divides the scene
into overall structures with gradual depth changes and local details with sharp depth transitions. This
frequency characteristic enables us to break down the challenging MDE task into multiple prediction
stages, progressing from simpler to more complex predictions. Initially, the DC coefficient C0 is
predicted, establishing a foundational depth context. Subsequently, the AC coefficients {Ci}S2−1
i=1
are
iteratively estimated in ascending frequency order. During the inverse transformation to the spatial
domain, any coefficients yet to be predicted are padded with zeros. In each iterative step k, we not
only predict higher-frequency components but also refine the preceding frequency predictions

Ck = Ck−1 + ∆Ck,
(5)

by estimating a correction term ∆Ck. To reduce the required iterations for estimating all S2 coef-
ficients, we utilize the energy compaction property of DCT, and partition the frequency spectrum
C into subgroups along the subdiagonal, yielding 2S −1 subgroups {gi}2S−1
i=0 . By merging the
high-frequency subgroups, we further streamline the iterative process. This grouping strategy ensures
that lower-frequency groups contain fewer components necessitating more prediction steps, while
higher-frequency groups encompass a larger number of components requiring fewer steps. The
intermediate depth maps are provided in Fig. 2 to elucidate the step-by-step prediction process.

3.3
DCDepth Architecture

Overview
We present the comprehensive framework of DCDepth in Fig. 3, which comprise four
key components: an image encoder, a Pyramid Feature Fusion (PFF) module, a decoder, and a
Progressive Prediction Head (PPH). The image encoder acts as a robust feature extractor capturing
image features F = {F0, F1, F2, F3} at varying resolutions of 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 relative to
the input image size. These multi-scale features are advantageous as the shallow features contain
texture-related details, while the deep features hold global and semantic information essential for
scene understanding. The PFF module, symbolized as Γ(·), is introduced to effectively amalgamate
these features, yielding a comprehensive integrated feature representation F′ = Γ(F). The decoder,
denoted as D(·), consists of three neural CRF [58] modules and two PixelShuffle [35] modules. This
configuration processes and upscales F′ to ˆF = D(F′), achieving 1/8 of the original resolution.
The PPH performs estimations at the same resolution as ˆF. It begins by down-sampling F0 to half
its resolution using the proposed DCT-based downsampling. This down-sampled feature is then
concatenated with ˆF, forming the initial hidden state for the progressive estimation.

Pyramid Feature Fusion Module
The primary objective of PFF is to harness the wealth of
information embedded in the multi-scale image features, thereby creating a more comprehensive and
enriched feature representation conducive to scene understanding. The layout of PFF is depicted in
the left box of Fig. 3. Effective feature aggregation necessitates a proficient downsampling strategy to
mitigate information loss, especially when downscaling at larger magnifications. To address this, we
introduce a novel DCT-based downsampling strategy engineered to minimize information loss during
downsampling. The operational procedure of this strategy is elucidated in the bottom-left corner of
Fig. 3. Consider a feature map F ∈RC×H×W slated for downsampling by a factor of R. We begin

the bottom-left corner, where R and r denote for downsampling factor and channel reduction rate,
respectively. The central section details the iterative process of PPH, with N indicating the number
of iterative steps. The frequency encoder utilized by PPH is illustrated at the right box.

by partitioning F into patches P ∈RC×R2× H

R × W

R . Each channel of P is then individually subjected
to Eq. 2 to transform the feature maps into the frequency domain. Leveraging the energy compaction
property of the DCT, the key information within F is condensed into a few dominant frequency
components characterized by large absolute values. This compression enables us to selectively reduce
the number of channels from C × R2 to C × R2

r with a reduction rate of r via 1 × 1 convolutions
configured with groups set to C. The squeezed feature maps are then consolidated through a sequence
of operations involving a 1 × 1 convolution followed by a 5 × 5 depth-wise convolution, culminating
in the generation of the final output featuring C′ channels and reduced spatial resolution.

Progressive Prediction Head
The PPH, as depicted in the middle segment of Fig. 3, incorporates
two specialized encoders: Es(·) for spatial-domain inputs and Ef(·) for frequency-domain inputs.
The spatial encoder, composed of three convolutional layers with a stride of 2, convolves and
downsamples the spatial-domain input ˆD, producing a feature map at 1/8 of the original resolution.
The architecture of Ef(·) is outlined in the right box of Fig. 3. For frequency input C ∈RL×H×W ,
where L signifies the number of valid frequency components, we first split them into L chunks with
shape 1 × H × W. Each chunk is then processed through three convolutional layers with Swish
activation [29] to extract features of dimensions C × H × W for each frequency component. Given
the variability in the number of valid frequency components across different iterative steps, we employ
cross-attention [41, 10] mechanism to merge information from the various frequency components. A
learnable aggregation token of dimensions 1×C is introduced to compile information from individual
frequency components at each pixel location, yielding feature outputs of shape C × H × W and
effectively compressing the dimension L. The PPH operates iteratively, utilizing a Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) [7, 39], denoted as G(·, ·), to encode the historical estimation states

Hi = G(Es( ˆDi−1), Ef(Ci−1)),
(6)
prior to iterative step i. The hidden state H is then projected to the coefficient output by a Pyramid
Pooling Module (PPM) [61] to aggregate global context, followed by a linear projection.

of missing values in the depth ground truth can render the model’s frequency-domain predictions
inadequately supervised. To mitigate this, we introduce two regularization terms. Specifically, to
enforce the sparsity of high-frequency coefficients, we define the frequency regularization loss as:

Lf =
X
(ϵu+v −1) · |fu,v|,
(8)

where fu,v is the frequency coefficient indexed by (u, v), and ϵ is set to 1.2. Additionally, we
incorporate a smoothness term to promote the smoothness of ˆD:

Ls = |∂x ˆD| · e−|∂xIt| + |∂y ˆD| · e−|∂yIt|,
(9)
where ∂x and ∂y represent image gradient along horizontal and vertical axes, respectively, and | · |
denote the absolute value function. The final loss is the weighted summation of these three loss terms.

offices, and classrooms. The images in this dataset are presented at a resolution of 640 × 480. We
follow the data split as outlined in BTS [17], featuring 24231 training images and 654 test images.
(2) TOFDC [52] is collected using a mobile phone paired with a lightweight Time-of-Flight (ToF)
camera, capturing a wide array of subjects like flowers, human figures, and toys under different
scenes and lighting conditions. The dataset is divided into 10,000 training samples and 560 testing
samples, with images at a resolution of 512 × 384. (3) KITTI [13] is a well-known outdoor dataset
that features RGB images coupled with sparse depth maps obtained from a laser scanner mounted on
a car. The images in this dataset have a resolution of 1216 × 352. We utilize both the Eigen split [11]
and the official split for our analysis. The Eigen split comprises 23158 training images and 697 test
images, while the official split includes 42949 training images and 500 test images.

Metrics
Consistent with prior works [58, 3, 34], we utilize a selection of well-established metrics
to provide a comprehensive evaluation. The key metrics include: relative absolute error (Abs Rel),
relative squared error (Sq Rel), root mean squared error (RMSE), absolute logarithmic error (log10),
root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSE log), inverse root mean squared error (iRMSE) and
threshold accuracy (δ < 1.25, δ < 1.252, and δ < 1.253). Please refer to the appendix for details.

4.2
Implementation Detail

The DCDepth is implemented using Pytorch library [25], and is trained with a batch size of 8 on
four NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs with data-distributed parallel computing. Our method is trained on
NYU-Depth-V2 dataset for 20 epochs, TOFDC dataset for 25 epochs, KITTI eigen split for 20 epochs
and KITTI official split for 12 epochs. The optimization objective of our method is a combination of
the scale-invariant log loss Ld, the frequency regularization Lf and the smoothness regularization
Ls, weighted by two scalar weights α and β:

L = Ld + α · Lf + β · Ls.
(10)

For the NYU-Depth-V2 and TOFDC datasets, these two weights are set to 2 × 10−3 and 0.0,
respectively, while for the KITTI dataset, both weights are set to 5 × 10−3. We opt for the Adam
optimizer [16] and leverage the OneCycle learning rate scheduler [37]. The learning rate schedule
entails an initial increase from 2 × 10−5 to 10−4 during the first 2 epochs, followed by a subsequent
decrease to 5 × 10−6 using a cosine annealing strategy. To enhance generalization and mitigate
overfitting, we integrate various data augmentation techniques into the training pipeline, including
random horizontal flips, random rotations, random color jitter, and random image filtering. For
feature extraction from images, we incorporate a Swin-Transformer architecture [23] pretrained on
the ImageNet dataset [8] as the image encoder. To reduce the iteration steps necessitated for spectrum

Comparison with the State-of-the-Art

NYU-Depth-V2
We benchmark our method against current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) approaches
on the indoor NYU-Depth-V2 dataset, with quantitative results presented in Tab. 1. Despite vision
transformers elevating the precision of depth estimation on this dataset, our method has surpassed
existing SoTA approaches, particularly in the Abs Rel and δ < 1.25 metrics. Qualitative comparisons,
illustrated in Fig. 4, reveal the adeptness of our method at capturing fine-grained geometries and
producing smoother depth estimations in planar areas. Regions where our method outperforms are
highlighted with white boxes, emphasizing its superior depth estimation accuracy.

TOFDC
The TOFDC dataset is characterized by its dense ground truth depth data. By utilizing this
dataset, we demonstrate the enhanced capability of our method to effectively harness the dense ground
truth, thereby achieving more accurate depth estimations compared to existing SoTAs. We present
the quantitative results in Tab. 2, where our method demonstrates superior performance over existing
SoTAs across a majority of the evaluated metrics. Specifically, our method achieves a significant
improvement on the Abs Rel and RMSE metrics compared to VA-DepthNet, with enhancements of
19.7% and 8.7%, respectively. Fig. 5 provides qualitative comparisons, illustrating that our method
not only produces more accurate depth estimations but also more effectively delineates the object
from the background, leading to more coherent depth estimations.

KITTI
We further evaluate our method on the outdoor dataset, KITTI, which has sparse depth
ground truth collected with LiDAR. This sparsity presents a contrast to the denser depth information
available in the NYU and TOFDC datasets, resulting in less robust supervision for learning frequency
coefficients. Despite this challenge, our method demonstrates its robustness by achieving SoTA
performance, which is attributed to the utilization of plenty training data coupled with our proposed
regularization constraints. The quantitative analysis, as detailed in Tab. 3, demonstrates the superior
performance of our method. Qualitative evaluations, depicted in Fig. 6, further substantiate the
superiority of our method. The quantitative results on KITTI official split are reported in Tab. 4. The
pretrained weights from Semantic-SAM [18] are employed to initialize the encoder. Our method
surpasses the compared approaches on the majority of metrics, particularly in the iRMSE metric,
underscoring the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

enumerates the inference speed and corresponding performance metrics of our method at various
iteration stages. All models are benchmarked on a single RTX 4090 GPU for consistency.

Parameter efficiency
We compare the parameter efficiency of our method with current SoTAs on
the NYU-Depth-V2 dataset, with the input resolution set to 640 × 480. The quantitative results, pre-
sented in Tab. 5, reveal that our method exhibits the fewest training parameters while simultaneously
achieving the best performance. For instance, our approach demonstrates a 9.0% improvement in the
RMSE metric, while utilizing 4.1% fewer parameters than NeWCRFS.

Ablation Study

We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed PPH and
PFF modules, and analyze the impact of the iteration steps on both model performance and inference
speed. All experiments presented in this section are conducted on the NYU-Depth-V2 dataset.

Effect of PPH module
To assess the impact of the PPH module, we build a baseline by excluding
the PPH from our method. In this setup, we employ a convolutional head to project the last-layer
features to the output dimension. The final depth prediction is obtained through either bilinear and
PixelShuffle [35] upsampling or inverse DCT that converts the predicted frequency coefficients back
to the spatial domain. Additionally, we introduce the adaptive bins [3] as an alternative competitor.
Quantitative experimental results are reported in Tab. 6. Among the three approaches outputting in
the spatial domain, the PixelShuffle-based approach performs the best. When predicting depth in the
frequency domain, performance further improves, demonstrating the superiority of frequency-domain
depth prediction. Lastly, our progressive prediction scheme significantly outperforms the compared
approaches by a large margin, underscoring the efficacy of the PPH module.

Effect of PFF module
To evaluate the impact of the PFF module, we establish a baseline by
excluding the PFF component from our method. We first introduce a convolutional layer and a PPM
[61] module to process the image feature at the last scale. Then, to validate the proposed DCT-based
downsampling strategy, we replace it with bilinear and PixelUnshuffle [35] downsampling. The
quantitative experimental results are reported in Tab. 7. The first two approaches, which only process
the last-scale feature, perform worse than the competitors with multi-scale feature aggregation. This
demonstrates the necessity of multi-scale feature aggregation for depth prediction. Furthermore,
our method, employing the DCT-based downsampling strategy, achieves the best performance,
showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed DCT-based strategy for feature downsampling.

Effect of iterative steps
We analyze the impact of iterative steps on both prediction accuracy
and inference speed. The results are reported in Tab. 5 and illustrated in Fig. 7. In summary, we
observe that both prediction accuracy and inference time increase as the number of iterations grows.
Leveraging the energy compaction property of the DCT, we strike a balance between accuracy and
speed by selectively discarding predictions for high-frequency components. This strategic approach
allows us to effectively reduce the number of iterative steps.

Limitation and Broader Impact

Our method employs the differentiable inverse DCT to transform the predicted spectrum back to the
spatial domain. By minimizing the difference between the spatial-domain estimation and the valid
ground truth, our model can be trained end-to-end. However, the sparsity of the ground truth may lead
to inefficient supervision of the frequency estimation. While we have proposed two regularization
terms to prevent our model from being incorrectly optimized, we observe that our method is more
effective with dense supervision. Exploring more effective training strategies when only sparse depth
ground truth is available will be an important research direction for our future work.

Monocular depth estimation is a pivotal technique for interpreting 3D scenes from 2D images and has
widespread applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and 3D modeling, among others. Given the
extensive applications of this task, our method is poised to positively impact these fields by advancing
their capabilities. Considering the fundamental nature of monocular depth estimation, our work is
not anticipated to have a significant negative societal impact.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce DCDepth, a novel framework for the MDE task. Departing from existing
methods, our method progressively estimates patch-wise depth in the frequency domain and then
recovers spatial-domain depth via inverse DCT. This formulation inherently models local depth
correlations and frames the estimation process as a global-to-local scheme, achieving more accurate
depth estimation. Leveraging the energy compaction property of DCT, our method strikes an effective
balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state our contributions and the claims
made well match the experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the limitations of our work in Sec. 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

15


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have elaborated our architecture design in the Method section, and have
described the implementation details in the Experiment section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

16


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The datasets used in our work are all publicly available, and we have properly
cited these datasets. The code and related materials of our work are publicly available at
https://github.com/w2kun/DCDepth.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the experimental details in the Experiment section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]

Justification: The datasets used in our experiments are large, and it is very costly to train our
model for many times. In summary, we don’t report the error bar.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

17


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reported the information of compute resources used in our experi-
ments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our research conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the broader impacts of our work in Sec. 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

18


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All datasets used in our work are properly cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

19


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
