Abstract

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown convincing performance in rendering
speed and fidelity, yet the generation of Gaussian Splatting remains a challenge
due to its discreteness and unstructured nature. In this work, we propose DiffGS,
a general Gaussian generator based on latent diffusion models. DiffGS is a pow-
erful and efficient 3D generative model which is capable of generating Gaussian
primitives at arbitrary numbers for high-fidelity rendering with rasterization. The
key insight is to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner via three
novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. Through
the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructured
3DGS with continuous Gaussian Splatting functions, where we then train a latent
diffusion model with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions
both unconditionally and conditionally. Meanwhile, we introduce a discretization
algorithm to extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions
via octree-guided sampling and optimization. We explore DiffGS for various tasks,
including unconditional generation, conditional generation from text, image, and
partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-Gaussian generation. We believe that DiffGS
provides a new direction for flexibly modeling and generating Gaussian Splatting.

Introduction

3D content creation is a vital task in computer graphics and 3D computer vision, which shows
great potential in real-world applications such as virtual reality, game design, film production, and
robotics. Previous 3D generative models usually take Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [41, 2, 62] as
the representation. However, the volumetric rendering for NeRF requires considerable computational
cost, leading to sluggish rendering speeds and significant memory burden. Recent advances of
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [28, 68, 23] have demonstrated its potential to serve as the next-
generation 3D representation by enabling both real-time rendering and high-fidelity appearance
modeling. Designing 3D generative models for 3DGS provides a scheme for real-time interaction
with 3D creations.

The core challenge in generative 3DGS modeling lies in its discreteness and unstructured nature,
which prevents the well-studied frameworks in structural image/voxel/video generation from trans-
ferring to directly generate 3DGS. Concurrent works [72, 19] alternatively transport Gaussians into
structural voxel grids with volume generation models [11] for generating Gaussians. However, these
methods lead to 1) abundant computational cost for high-resolution voxels, and 2) limited number of
generated Gaussians constrained by the voxel resolutions. Certain voxelization schemes [19] also
introduce information loss, making it challenging to maintain high-quality Gaussian reconstructions.

Figure 1: The illustration of DiffGS. We fit 3DGS from multi-view images and then disentangle it
into three Gaussian Splatting Functions. We train a Gaussian VAE with a latent diffusion model for
generating these functions, followed by a Gaussian extraction algorithm to obtain the final generated
Gaussians.

To address these challenges, we present DiffGS, a novel diffusion-based generative model for general
3D Gaussian Splatting, which is capable of efficiently generating high-quality Gaussian primitives at
arbitrary numbers. The key insight of DiffGS is to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled
manner via three novel functions: Gaussian Probability Function (GauPF), Gaussian Color Function
(GauCF) and Gaussian Transform Function (GauTF). Especially, GauPF indicates the geometry of
3DGS by modeling the probabilities of each sampled 3D location to be a Gaussian location. GauCF
and GauTF predict the Gaussian attributes of appearances and transformations given a 3D location
as input, respectively. Through the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and
unstructured 3DGS with three continuous Gaussian Splatting functions.

With the disentangled and powerful representation, the next step is to design a generative model
with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions. We propose a Gaussian VAE model
for creating compressed representation for the Gaussian Splatting functions. The Gaussian VAE
learns a regularized latent space which maps the Gaussians Splatting functions of each shape into
one latent vector. A latent diffusion model (LDM) is simultaneously trained at the latent space for
generating novel 3DGS shapes. With the powerful LDM, we explore DiffGS to generate diverse
3DGS both conditionally and unconditionally. Finally, we introduce a discretization algorithm to
extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and
optimization. The key idea is to first extract 3D Gaussian geometry from GauPF by sampling 3D
locations at the 3D spaces with the highest Gaussian probabilities, and then predict the Gaussian
attributes with GauCF and GauTF. We illustrate the overview of DiffGS in Fig. 1.

We systematically summarize the superiority of DiffGS in terms of: 1) Efficiency, we design DiffGS
based on Gaussian Splatting and Latent Diffusion Models, which shows significant efficiency in
model training, inference and shape rendering. 2),3) Generality and quality, we generate native 3DGS
without processes like voxelization, leading to unimpaired quality and generality in applying to
downstream 3DGS applications. 4) Scalability, we scalably generate Gaussian primitives at arbitrary
numbers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic ShapeNet dataset and real-world
DeepFashion3D dataset, which demonstrate our non-trivial improvements over the state-of-the-art
methods. In summary, our contributions are given as follows.

• We propose DiffGS, a novel diffusion-based generative model for general 3D Gaussian
Splatting, which is capable of efficiently generating high-quality Gaussian primitives at
arbitrary numbers.

• We introduce a novel schema to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner via
three functions to model Gaussian probabilities, Gaussian colors and Gaussian transforms,
respectively. We simultaneously propose a discretization algorithm to extract Gaussians
from these functions via octree-guided sampling and optimization.

• DiffGS achieves remarkable performances under various tasks including unconditional
generation, conditional generation from text, image, and partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-
Gaussian generation.

Rendering-Guided 3D Representation

Neural implicit representations which learn signed [46, 79, 37] (unsigned [77, 78, 75]) distance
functions or occupancy functions [39] have largely advanced the field of 3D generation [84, 76, 66,
36], reconstruction [80, 26, 24, 25, 45] and perception [82, 83, 81, 32, 31]. Remarkable progress
have been achieved in the field of novel view synthesis (NVS) [41, 47, 62, 2, 43], with the proposal
of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [41]. NeRF implicitly represents scene appearance and geometries
using MLP-based neural networks, optimized through volume rendering to achieve outstanding NVS
quality. Some subsequent variants [1, 15, 49] have shown promising performance by advancing
NeRF in terms of rendering quality, scalability and view-consistency. Additionally, more recent
methods [43, 7, 14, 64] explore the training and rendering efficiency of NeRF by introducing feature-
grids based 3D representations. Instant-NGP [43] highly accelerates NeRF learning by introducing
multi-resolution feature grids based on hash table with fully-fused CUDA kernel implementations.
However, the NeRF representations which require expensive neural network inferences during volume
rendering, still struggles in the applications where real-time rendering is required.

Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [28, 59, 30, 68, 71, 18, 74] has showcased
impressive real-time results in novel view synthesis (NVS). 3DGS [28] has led to revolutions in the
NVS field by demonstrating superior performances in multiple domains. However, the generation of
Gaussian Splatting remains a challenge due to its discreteness and unstructured nature. In this paper,
we introduce a novel schema to represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with three continuous
Gaussian Splatting Functions, thus ingeniously tackle the challenge by designing generative models
for the functions.

3D Generative Models

The field of creating 3D contents with generative models has emerged as a particularly captivating
research direction. A series of studies [48, 33, 65, 52, 40, 36, 9, 56, 69, 60] focus on optimization-
based frameworks based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which achieve convincing generation
performances by distilling 3D geometry and appearance of the radiance fields with pretrained 2D
diffusion models [44, 21] as the prior. However, these studies entail significant computational costs
due to time-consuming per-scene optimization. Going beyond optimization-based 3D generation,
recent methods [42, 61, 63, 27] explore 3D generative methods based on diffusion models to directly
learn priors from 3D datasets for generative radiance fields modeling, which typically represent
radiance fields as structural triplanes [63, 55, 17] or voxels [61, 42, 11]. DiffRF [42] leverage a voxel
based NeRF representation with 3D U-Nets as the backbone to train a diffusion model.

With the recent advances in 3DGS [28], designing a powerful 3D generative model for generating
3DGS is expected to be a popular research topic. This also brings significant challenges due to
the discreteness and unstructured nature of 3DGS, which prevents the well-studied frameworks
in structural image/voxel/video generation from transferring to directly generate 3DGS. A series
of studies [70, 86, 22, 73] follow the schema of image-based reconstruction without generative
modeling, which lack the ability to generate diverse shapes. Concurrent studies GaussianCube [72]
and GVGEN [19] follow the voxel-based representations to transport Gaussians into structural voxel
grids with volume generation models for generating Gaussians. However, these methods come with
several drawbacks, including abundant computational costs for high-resolution voxels and a restricted
number of generated Gaussians constrained by voxel resolutions. Some voxelization strategies
[19] may introduce information loss, leading to difficulties in preserving high-quality Gaussian
reconstructions. In contrast, our proposed DiffGS explores a new perspective to directly represent the
discrete and unstructured 3DGS with three continuous Gaussian Splatting Functions. Though the
insight, we design a latent diffusion model for efficiently generating high-quality Gaussian primitives
by learning to generate the Gaussian Splatting Functions. DiffGS generates general Gaussians at
arbitrary numbers with a specially designed octree-based extraction algorithm.

Gaussian Splatting Functions in Sec. 3.2. We then introduce the Gaussian Variational Auto-encoder
and the Latent Diffusion Model for compressing and generative modeling on Gaussian Splatting
Functions, as shown in Sec. 3.3. A novel discretization algorithm is further developed in Sec. 3.4 to
extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and
optimization.

3.1
Preview Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [28] represents a 3D shape or scene as a set of Gaussians with
attributes to model the geometries and view-dependent appearances. For a 3DGS G = {gi}N
i=1
containing N Gaussians, the geometry of i-th Gaussian is explicitly parameterized via 3D covariance
matrix Σi and its center σi ∈R3, fomulated as:

gi(x) = exp

−1

2(x −σi)T Σ−1(x −σi)

,
(1)

where the covariance matrix Σi = risisT
i rT
i is factorized into a rotation matrix ri ∈R4 and a scale
matrix si ∈R. The appearance of the Gaussian gi is controlled by an opacity value oj ∈R and a
color value ci ∈R3. Note that the color is represented as a series of sphere harmonics coefficients
in practice of 3DGS, yet we still keep its definition as three-dimension color ci in our paper for a
clear understanding on our method. To this end, the 3DGS G is defined as {gi = {σi, ri, si, oi, ci} ∈
RK}N
j=1, where K is dimension of the combined attributes in each Gaussian.

3.2
Functional Gaussian Splatting Representation

The key challenge in generative 3DGS modeling lies in its discreteness and unstructured nature,
which prevents the well-studied generative frameworks from transferring to directly generate 3DGS.
We address this challenge by introducing to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner
via three novel functions: Gaussian Probability Function (GauPF), Gaussian Color Function (GauCF)
and Gaussian Transform Function (GauTF), respectively. Through the novel disentangling of 3DGS,
we represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with three continuous Gaussian Splatting Functions.

Gaussian Probability Function. Gaussian Probability Function (GauPF) indicates the geometry
of 3DGS by modeling the probabilities of each sampled 3D location to be a Gaussian location.
Given a set of 3D query location Q = {qj ∈R3}M
i=1 sampled in 3D space around a fitted 3DGS
G = {gi ∈R3}N
j=1, the GauPF of G predicts the probabilities p of queries {qj}M
i=1 to be a Gaussian
location in G, fomulated as:
pj = GauPF(qj) ∈[0, 1].
(2)

The idea of Gaussian probability modeling comes from the observation that the further a 3D location
qj is from all Gaussians, the lower the probability that any Gaussian occupies the space at qj.
Therefore the ground truth Gaussian probability of qj is defined as:

GauPF(qj) = τ(λ( min
i∈[1,N] ||qj −σi||2)),
(3)

where min
i∈[1,N] ||qj −σi||2 indicates the distance from qj to the nearest Gaussian center in {σi}N
i=1, λ

is a truncation function which filters the extremely large values and τ is a continuous function which
maps the query-to-Gaussian distances to probabilities in the range of [0,1].

A learned GauPF implicitly models the locations of 3D Gaussian centers, which is the key factor for
generating high-quality 3DGS. The extraction of 3DGS centers from GauPF is then achieved with
our designed Gaussian extraction algorithm which will be introduced in Sec. 3.4.

Gaussian Color and Transform Modeling. Gaussian Color Function (GauCF) and Gaussian
Transform Function (GauTF) predict the Gaussian attributes of appearances and transformations from
Gaussian geometries. Specifically, given the center σi of a Gaussian gi in G as input, GauCF predicts
the color attribute ci and GauTF predicts the rotation ri, scale si and opacity oi, formulated as:

{ci} = GauCF(σi); {ri, si, oi} = GauTF(σi).
(4)

Note that GauCF and GauTF mainly focus on predicting the Gaussian colors and transforms from 3D
Gaussian centers. This is different from the GauPF which models the probabilities of query samples
in the 3D space. The reason is that GauPF focuses on exploring the geometry of 3DGS from the 3D
space, while GauCF and GauTF learn to predict the Gaussian attributes from the known geometries.

Through the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with
three continuous Gaussian Splatting Functions. The functional representation is a general and flexible
term for 3DGS which has no restrictions on the Gaussian numbers, densities, geometries, etc.

3.3
Gaussian Variational Auto-encoder and Latent Diffusion

With the disentangled and powerful representation, the next step is to design a generative model
with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting Functions. We follow the common schema to
design a Gaussian Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) [29] with a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) [44]
as the generative model. The detailed framework and the training pipeline of DiffGS are illustrated in
Fig. 1(a).

Gaussian VAE. The Gaussian VAE compresses the Gaussian Splatting Functions into a regularized
latent space by mapping the Gaussian Splatting Functions of each 3DGS shape into a latent vector,
from which we can also recover the Gaussian Splatting Functions. Specifically, the Gaussian VAE
consists of 1) a GS encoder ϕen to learn representations from 3DGS and encodes each 3DGS into a
latent vector z, 2) a triplane decoder ϕde which decodes the latent z into a feature triplane, and 3)
three neural predictors ψpf, ψcf and ψtf which serve as the implementation of GauPF, GauCF and
GauTF to predict Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms, respectively.

Given a fitted 3DGS G = {gi}N
j=1 as input, the GS encoder ϕen extracts a global latent feature z from
G, which is then decoded into a feature triplane t ∈RH×W ×C×3 with the decoder ϕde, formulated
as:
z = ϕen(G); t = ϕde(z).
(5)

The triplane t consists of three orthogonal feature planes {tXY , tXZ, tY Z} which are aligned to the
axex. For a 3D location qj, we obtain its corresponding feature fj = interp(t, qj) from the triplane
t by projecting qj onto the orthogonal feature planes and concatenating the tri-linear interpolated

features at the three planes. We then predict the Gaussian probability, color and transform of qj with
the neural Gaussian Splatting Function predictors as:

{ ˆpi} = ψpf(fj); {ˆci} = ψcf(fj); {ˆri, ˆsi, ˆoi} = ψtf(fj).
(6)

The Gaussian VAE is trained with the target of accurately predicting Gaussian attributes and robustly
regularizing the latent space. In practice, the training objective is formulated as:

LVAE = ∥{ˆp, ˆc, ˆr, ˆs, ˆo} −{p, c, r, s, o}∥1 + β (DKL (Qϕ(z|G)∥P(z))) .
(7)

The first loss term indicates the L1 loss between the predicted Gaussian attributes in Eq. (6) and
the target ones defined by the ground truth Gaussian Splatting Functions in Eq. (2) and Eq. (4).
The second term in Eq. (7) is the KL-divergence loss with a factor of β, which constrains on the
regularization of the learned latent space of z. Specifically, we define the inferred posterior of
z as the distribution Qϕ(z|G), which is regularized to align with the Gaussian distribution prior
P(z) = N(0, I), where I is the standard deviation.

Gaussian LDM. With the trained Gaussian VAE in place, we are now able to encode any 3DGS
into a compact 1D latent vector z. We then train a latent diffusion model (LDM) [44] efficiently
on the latent space. A diffusion model is trained to generate samples from a target distribution by
reversing a process that incrementally introduces noise. We define {z0, z1, ..., zK} as the forward
process γ(z0:K) which gradually transforms a real data z0 into Gaussian noise (zT ) by adding noises.
The backward process µ(z0:K) leverages a neural generator µ to denoise zK into a real data sample.

To achieve controllable generation of 3DGS, we introduce a conditioning mechanism [54] into the
diffusion process with cross-attention. Given an input condition y (e.g. text, image, partial 3DGS),
we leverage a custom encoder δ to project y into the condition embedding δ(y). The embedding is
then fused into the generator µ with cross attention modules. Following DDPM, we simply adopt the
optimizing objective to train the generator for predicting noises ϵσ, formulated as:

LLDM = Ez0,t,ϵ∼N(0,I)
h
∥ϵ −ϵσ (zt, δ(y), t)∥2i
,
(8)

where t is a time step and ϵ is a noise latent sampled from the Gaussian distribution N(0, I),
respectively. We adopt the well-studied architecture DALLE-2 [53] as the LDM implementation.

3.4
Gaussian Extraction Algorithm

The final step for the generation process of DiffGS is to extract 3DGS from the generated Gaussian
Splatting Functions, similar to the effect of Marching Cubes algorithm [34] which extracts meshes
from Signed Distance Functions. The key factor is to extract the geometries of 3DGS, i.e., Gaussian
locations and the appearances of 3DGS, i.e., colors and transforms. The full generation pipeline is
shown in Fig. 2(b).

Octree-Guided Geometry Sampling. The locations of 3D Gaussian centers indicate the geometry of
the represented 3DGS. We aim to design a discretization algorithm to obtain the discrete 3D locations
from the learned continuous Gaussian Probability Function parameterized with the neural network
ψpf, which models the probability of each query sampled in the 3D space to be a 3D Gaussian

location. To achieve this, we design an octree-based sampling and optimization algorithm which
generates accurate center locations of 3D Gaussians at arbitrary numbers.

We show the 2D illustration of the algorithm in Fig. 3. Assume that the 3D space is divided into
the high probability area (the yellow region) and the low probability area (the green region) by
the generated GauPF. We aim to extract the geometry as the locations with high probabilities. A
naive implementation is to densely sample queries in the 3D space and keep the ones with large
probabilities as outputs. However, it will lead to high computational cost for inferencing and the
discrete sampling also struggles to accurately reach the locations with largest probabilities in the
continuous GauPF. We get inspiration from octree [38, 67] to design a progressive strategy which
only explores the 3D regions with large probabilities in current octree depth for further subdivision in
the next octree depth. After L layers of octree subdivision, we reach the local regions with largest
probabilities, from where we uniformly sample N 3D points as the proxy points {ρi}N
i=1 representing
coarse locations of Gaussian centers.

Optimizing Geometry with GauPF. To further refine the proxy points to the exact locations of
Gaussian centers with largest probabilities in GauPF, we propose to further optimize the proxy points
with the supervision from learned GauPF ψpf. Specifically, we set the position of proxy points
{ρi = {ρxi, ρyi, ρzi}}N
i=1 to be learnable and optimize them to reach the positions { ˆσi}N
i=1 with
largest probabilities of ψpf. The optimization target is formulated as:

LGeo = −1

N

ψpf(ρi).

Note that we can set N to arbitrary numbers, enabling DiffGS to generate 3DGS with no limits on
the density and resolution.

Extracting Gaussian Attributes. We now obtain the estimated geometry indicating the pre-
dicted Gaussian centers { ˆσi}N
i=1.
We then extract the appearances and transforms from the
generated triplane t, Gaussian Color Function ψcf and Gaussian Transform Function ψtf as

Experiment

4.1
Unconditional Generation

Dataset and Metrics. For unconditional generation of 3D Gaussian Splatting, we conduct experi-
ments under the airplane and chair classes of ShapeNet [6] dataset. Following previous works [42, 4],
we report two widely-used image generation metrics Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [20] and
Kernel Inception Distance (KID) [3] for evaluating the rendering quality of our proposed DiffGS and
previous state-of-the-art works. The metrics are evaluated between 50K renderings of the generated
shapes and 50K renderings of the ground turth ones, both at the resolution of 1024×1024.

Comparisons. We compare DiffGS with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the rendering
quality of generated shapes, including the GAN-based methods GET3D [16] and the diffusion-based
method DiffTF [4]. The quantitative comparison is shown in Tab. 1, where DiffGS achieves the best
performance over all the baselines. We further show the visual comparison on the renderings of some
generated shapes in Fig. 4, where the GAN-based GET3D struggles in generating complex shapes
and the generations of DiffTF is blurry with poor textures. In contrast, DiffGS produces significantly
more visual-appealing and high-fidelity generations in terms of rendering and geometry qualities.

4.2
Conditional Generation.

We explore the conditional generation ability of DiffGS given texts, images and partial 3DGS as the
input conditions. All the experiments are conducted under the chair class of ShapeNet [6] dataset
with commonly used data splits in previous methods [10, 35].

Text/Image-conditional Gaussian Splatting Generation. For introducing texts/images as the
conditions for controllable Gaussian Splatting generation, we leverage the frozen text and image
encoder from the pretrained CLIP [51] model as the implementation of custom text encoder γtext and
γimage for achieving text/image embeddings. We then train DiffGS with the conditional optimization
objective in Eq.(8). We show the visualization of some text/image conditional generations produced
by DiffGS in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b). The results show that DiffGS accurately recovers the semantics
and geometries described in the text prompts and the images, demonstrating the powerful capability
of DiffGS in generating high-fidelity 3DGS from text descriptions or vision signals.

Gaussian Splatting Completion. Additionally, we explore an interesting task of Gaussian Splatting
completion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus and introduce solutions for this
task. Specifically, the Gaussian Splatting completion task is to recover the complete 3DGS from a

partial 3DGS which contains large occlusions. In real-world applications, having only sparse views
with limited viewpoint movement available for optimizing 3DGS often results in a partial 3DGS.
Solving Gaussian Splatting completion task enables us to infer the complete and dense 3DGS from
the partial ones for improving the rendering quality at invisible viewpoints.

We introduce DiffGS with partial 3DGS as the conditions for solving this task. Specifically, we simply
leverage a modified PointNet [50] as the custom encoder γpartial for partial 3DGS. Fig. 5(c) presents
the visualization of Gaussian Splatting completion results produced by DiffGS. The results show that
DiffGS is capable of recovering complex geometries and detailed appearances from highly occluded
3DGS. Please refer to the appendix for implementation details on Gaussian Splatting completion.

4.3
Point-to-Gaussian Generation

We further introduce DiffGS for another challenging and vital task of Point-to-Gaussian generation.
This task aims to generate the Gaussian attributes given a 3D point cloud as input. The task serves as
the bridge between the easily accessible point clouds and the powerful 3DGS representation which
efficiently models high-quality 3D appearances.

Dataset and Implementation. We conduct experiments under the chair and airplane classes of
ShapeNet and also the widely-used garment dataset DeepFashion3D [85]. The DeepFashion3D
dataset is a real-captured 3D dataset containing complex textures. For implementing Point-to-
Gaussian, we simply train the Gaussain VAE with the three-dimension point clouds as inputs, instead
of the 3DGS with attributes. Please refer to the Appendix for more details on data preparation and
implementation.

Performances. We provide the visualization of some Point-to-Gaussian fitting and generation results
in Fig. 6. We shown the fitting results for Deepfashion3D [85] dataset and the generation results for
the test set of airplane and chair classes in ShapeNet [6]. DiffGS produces visual-appealing 3DGS
generations given only 3D point cloud geometries as inputs. The results demonstrate that DiffGS
can accurately predict Gaussian attributes for 3D point clouds. We believe DiffGS provides a new
direction for 3DGS content generation by connecting 3DGS with point clouds.

To evaluate some major designs and important hyper-parameters in DiffGS, we conduct ablation
studies under the chair class of ShapeNet dataset. We report the performance in terms of PSNR,
SSIM and LPIPS of the reconstructed 3DGS with Gaussian VAE.

Framework Designs. We first evaluate some major
designs of our framework in Tab. 2. We justify the
effectiveness of introducing the truncation function λ
when modeling GauPF and report the results without
λ as ‘w/o truncation’. We then explore implementing
the projection function τ either as τ(x) = e−x (as
shown in ‘Exponent’) or as a linear projection (as

shown in ‘Ours’). We also show the results without the optimization process during Gaussian
extraction as ‘w/o Optimization’, which demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing Gaussians to
the exact locations.

Gaussian Numbers. One significant advantage of DiffGS
lies in the ability of generating high-quality Gaussians at
arbitrary numbers. To explore how the number of Gaus-
sians affects the rendering quality, we conduct ablations
on the Gaussian numbers as shown in Fig. 3. The results
demonstrate that denser Gaussians lead to better quality.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce DiffGS for generative modeling of 3DGS. DiffGS disentangled represent
3DGS via three novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. We then
train a latent diffusion model with the target of generating these functions both conditionally and
unconditionally. DiffGS generates 3DGS with arbitrary numbers by an octree-guided extraction
algorithm. The experimental results on various tasks demonstrate the superiority of DiffGS.

Appendix

A
More Experimental Details

A.1
Gaussian Splatting Data Preparing

DiffGS takes the fitted 3DGS as input for learning generative modeling. To prepare the 3DGS dataset
of ShapeNet, we uniformly render 100 views from the ground truth meshes with blender to first
obtain the dense multi-view images for each 3D shape in the chair and airplane classes of ShapeNet
dataset. After that, we leverage the vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting [28] method for fitting the 3DGS
for each shape with the rendered multi-view images.

For achieving more stable and regularized 3DGS data for better generative modeling, we design some
strategies for better initialization and optimization of 3DGS. (1) Since we fit 3DGS from existing
3D datasets with known geometries, we can simply sample dense point clouds uniformly from the
surfaces as the perfect initialization for 3DGS optimization, instead of initializing with COLMAP
points. The sampled point number is set to 100K. (2) We observe that optimizing 3DGS freely may
often lead to some extremly large Gaussians. This will lead to unstable training of the Gaussian VAE
and latent diffusion models, further affecting the generative modeling results. Therefore, we clip the
scales at a maximum size of 0.01 to avoid the abnormal Gaussians.

A.2
Gaussian Splatting Completion

We explore the task of Gaussian Splatting completion. Specifically, the Gaussian Splatting completion
task is to recover the complete 3DGS from a partial 3DGS which contains large occlusions. In
real-world applications, having only sparse views with limited viewpoint movement available for
optimizing 3DGS often results in a partial 3DGS. Solving Gaussian Splatting completion task enables
us to infer the complete and dense 3DGS from the partial ones for improving the rendering quality at
invisible viewpoints.

Data preparation. We generate partial 3D Gaussian Splatting data from the complete datasets in
a straightforward manner. First, we randomly divide each 3DGS into 8 chunks. Then, we occlude
7 chunks, leaving the remaining chunk as the partial 3DGS. This method allows us to prepare
partial-complete 3DGS pairs for training and testing.

Implementation. To leverage DiffGS with partial 3DGS as the conditions for Gaussian Splatting
completion, we leverage a modified PointNet [50] as the custom encoder γpartial for partial 3DGS,
which projects the partial 3DGS with K channels into a global partial 3DGS embedding. The DiffGS
for Gaussian Splatting completion is trained with the target of Eq.(8) by introducing partial 3DGS
embeddings through the cross-attention module.

A.3
Point-to-Gaussian Generation

Data preparation. For the task of Point-to-Gaussian generation, we first prepare the training/testing
data as point cloud-3DGS pairs obtained through the Gaussian Splatting Fitting process described in
Sec. A.1. Specifically, the point clouds are generated by densely sampling 100K points on the ground
truth meshes, while the paired 3DGS are obtained by optimizing with multi-view images rendered
around the ground truth meshes. The data preparation for the DeepFashion3D [85] dataset follows
the same process as for the ShapeNet [6] dataset.

Note that we train the Point-to-Gaussian DiffGS models for fitting the DeepFashion3D dataset, which
contains only 563 garment instances. In contrast, we split the airplane and chair classes of the
ShapeNet dataset into train/test sets to learn generalizable representations that enables DiffGS to
predict novel appearances for unknown point cloud geometries. The results shown in Fig. 6 of the
main paper include both the fitting results on the DeepFashion3D dataset and the generation results
from the point clouds in the test set of the airplane and chair classes in the ShapeNet dataset.

Implementation. For implementing Point-to-Gaussian, we train the Gaussian VAE using three-
dimensional point clouds as inputs instead of 3DGS with attributes. Specifically, we replace the GS
encoder in the Gaussian VAE with a PointNet-based network to learn representations from three-
dimensional point clouds and recover Gaussian attributes from them. All architectures, optimization

targets, and Gaussian extraction processes remain the same as in the Gaussian VAE, except for the
encoder. Note that for the Point-to-Gaussian task, the Gaussian LDM is not trained, as we focus
solely on decoding and extracting Gaussians from the point cloud inputs.

B
More Comparisons and Ablations

We further conducted comprehensive experiments focusing on two critical tasks: text-to-3D gener-
ation and single-view 3D generation. These tasks are central to demonstrating the flexibility and
robustness of our approach in different application scenarios.

B.1
Image-to-3D Generation

We compare DiffGS with various SOTA methods on implicit generation or Gaussian Splatting genera-
tion. The visual comparison of image-to-3D generation is presented in Fig. 7. These results illustrate
the superior visual quality and fidelity achieved by our method compared to the SOTA baseline
methods including SplatterImage [57], TriplaneGaussian [86], LGM [58] and DreamGaussian [59].
Our approach consistently produced more detailed and accurate generations, effectively capturing
intricate textures and geometries that are often challenging for the compared optimization-based and
multi-view based methods.

B.2
Text-to-3D Generation

We conduct evaluations under the difficult task of text-to-3D generation. We compare DiffGS with
the SOTA data-driven and optimization-based methods Shap·E [27], LGM [58] and DreamGaussian
[59]. We present the visual comparisons in Fig. 8, where DiffGS achieves more visual-appealing
results compared to the baselines.

We also follow the common setting to conduct quantitative comparisons using the CLIP score, a metric
that measures the semantic alignment between the generated 3D models and the input conditions.
The results are presented in Tab. 4. According to Tab. 4, our method achieved higher CLIP scores
than both DreamGaussian and LGM. This indicates that our approach more faithfully adheres to the
condition inputs.

However, it is important to note that DiffGS is trained on the ShapeNet dataset, while some methods
(e.g., LGM, TriplaneGaussian) are trained on the Objaverse [13] dataset. As a result, the comparisons
may not fully reflect the generation capabilities due to different data sources. The above comparisons
are provided for reference, and we plan to conduct further training using the same dataset for a more
accurate comparison.

Unconditional Generation

We compare DiffGS with DiffTF [4] on the airplane class of the ShapeNet dataset. The visual
comparison is shown in Fig. 9, where our proposed DiffGS achieves more visually appealing results
than DiffTF. DiffTF often produces shape generations with blurry textures, resulting in poor rendering
quality. In contrast, our method produces high-fidelity renderings with the generated high-quality
3DGS, accurately capturing both geometry and appearances.

We further make a comparison with the GAN-based 3D generative model EG3D [5] and the NeRF-
based SSD-NeRF [8] on unconditional generation of car models under ShapeNet dataset. The visual
comparison is shown in Fig. 10, where DiffGS significantly outperforms EG3D and SSD-NeRF on
the geometry and appearance details.

B.4
Ablation Study on Octree Depth

The depth of the octree in our Gaussian extraction algorithm is an important hyper-parameter in the
framework. To explore how the octree depth affects the rendering quality, we conduct ablations on
the octree depth as shown in Tab. 5. The results demonstrate that a larger octree depth leads to better
quality by capturing more geometry details.

The deeper octree depths may lead to increased complexity in Gaussian extraction. To address the
trade-off between the efficiency and quality, we conducted an ablation study in Tab. 5 to identify
the optimal balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality. The results indicate that
a moderate increase in octree depths can significantly improve the Gaussian quality with very few
additional cost.

Ablation Study on Framework Designs

We also conduct ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing triplanes as the decoder
implementation of our Gaussian VAE. We replace the Triplane decoder with simple Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) model and show the performance in Fig. 11. The results indicate that using MLP
fails to capture the intricacies of Gaussian modeling adequately. The Triplane model demonstrates
superior performance in terms of detail accuracy and geometric fidelity.

C
Efficiency Analysis and Comparison

C.1
Parameters and Inference Time

We compare the model sizes and generation time between DiffGS and other SOTA generative models.
The results are shown in Tab. 6, where we highlight that DiffGS demonstrates significant efficiency
compared to the SOTA baselines DiffTF, Shap·E, SSDNeRF and DreamGaussian. DiffGS also offers
competitive generation time with GET3D and LGM. DiffGS has a significantly smaller number of
parameters compared to most baseline methods. The smaller parameter count of DiffGS translates

into reduced memory usage and potentially faster inference times, which can be advantageous in
environments where computational resources are limited.

C.2
Gaussian Numbers during Extraction

We conducted supplementary experiments to analyze the impact of the number of extracted Gaussian
points on optimization time. The results of this ablation study are presented in Tab. 7. The results show
that for generations with a smaller number of Gaussians, e.g., 50K, the optimization is extremely fast,
taking only 0.64 seconds to converge. For high-quality Gaussian generations with 350K primitives,
the optimization time increases to 2.5 seconds, which is still efficient. In our experiments, we selected
a configuration of 350K Gaussian points. This choice balances quality and computational efficiency,
providing a robust representation of the model without excessively increasing processing time.

Implement Details

We implement DiffGS with Pytorch Lightning. We leverage the Adam optimizer with a learning rate
of 0.0001. We train DiffGS with eight 3090 GPUs and the convergence in each class of ShapeNet
dataset takes around 5 days. The Guassian encoder and Triplane decoder are implemented based on
the SDF-VAE encoder and decoder of DiffusionSDF [12], where we modify the PointNet [50] in the
SDF-VAE encoder to receive K dimension 3DGS as the inputs.

E
Limitation

One limitation of our method is that it sometimes produces overly creative color schemes. We
illustrate this issue with two examples in Fig. 12. As shown, the failure cases of DiffGS result in
excessively colorful appearances. For instance, the chair shown exhibits a color transition from
yellow to blue to green and finally to orange. These overly creative generations may not accurately
reflect real-world shapes.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We analysis the limitations of our method in Sec.F of the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

21


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the detailed information in reproducing our methods in Sec.3,
Sec.4 of the main paper and the appendix. We also provide a demonstration code of our
method in the supplementary materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

22


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide our demonstration code as a part of our supplementary materials.
We will release the source code, data and instructions upon acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the training and testing details in the experiment section (Sec.4)
and the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We report the average performance as the experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

23


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The computer resources needed to reproduce the experiments are provided in
Sec.C of the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the applications and potential impacts of our method in the
introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

24


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use the open-sourced datasets under their licenses.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

25


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
