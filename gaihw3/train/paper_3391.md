Abstract

The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for automatic medical report genera-
tion from X-ray images, V LScore. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing
evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clini-
cal aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting
all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between
radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the
benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked
errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists’ judgments.
In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes
well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g.,
removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in
current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis.

Introduction

Medical reports are crucial for summarizing diagnoses seen in X-ray images. These reports facilitate
communication among healthcare professionals, ensuring continuity of care and informed decision-
making. The process of generating these reports requires expertise and time, typically involving
a trained radiologist who writes them from scratch. Automatic generation of medical reports
therefore has the potential to enhance patient care and streamline administrative processes, ultimately
improving healthcare delivery. Consequently, numerous research efforts have been directed toward
this goal [3, 4, 15, 17, 27, 30]. These medical report generation models aim to produce coherent and
accurate reports based on input images, with a current focus on chest radiology reports.

However, evaluating the generated reports is a challenge in its own right [34]. This evaluation is
essential to determine whether a new technique truly advances the state of the art. Currently, two
families of metrics are being used, language metrics and clinical metrics. Derived from language
generation tasks, such as neural machine translation or image captioning, generated medical reports
are evaluated with natural language generation (NLG) metrics. In our context, the similarity between
the generated report (candidate) to the ground-truth report (reference) associated with the input image
is measured. To evaluate some of the medical entities that are expressed in the report, clinical efficacy
(CE) is measured by applying a pre-trained classification network on the ground-truth and output
reports to assess their agreement on pre-defined pathologies [13, 26]. These metrics suffer from
drawbacks, which the current paper attempts to solve, as described hereafter.

The traditional NLG metrics, namely BLEU [25], METEOR [1], ROUGE [20], and CIDEr [28], are
n-gram-based and measure the token (or sequence of tokens) overlap between the candidate and
reference texts. More recent metrics, such as BERTScore [35], rely on deep textual feature similarity,
making them more robust to variations in exact tokens and instead utilizing contextual embeddings.
However, these metrics fail to capture several critical nuances in the context of medical reports.
In particular, while the reports are typically lengthy and structured, following a systematic review

(a) Same findings
(b) Different location

Figure 1: Vision-language based evaluation of generated reports. Our proposed evaluation metric
for a reference report (GT) and a candidate report takes into account the associated image, thereby
overcoming several drawbacks of common metrics that only measure the distance between two texts.
Consequently, when comparing two semantically very similar reports that suit an image (a), our
metric suggests a high degree of similarity, whereas other metrics are unaware of these similarities
and therefore give low scores due to textual differences. In contrast, when comparing two reports that
are textually similar but differ by a single word that impacts the location of a finding (b), common
metrics still provide a very high score, while our metric penalizes for that error.

method, they contain mostly normal findings and general references. The crucial findings may occupy
a small portion of the report, sometimes comprising only one or two words (e.g., "large pleural
effusion" vs. "no pleural effusions"). As these findings may be brief, they may not significantly
impact the scores, despite their important information. Furthermore, radiologists frequently include in
the report information that cannot be extracted from an image, such as the patient’s history, findings
from other sources, or details about treatment. These metrics penalize for such missing information.

CE metrics are oblivious to these issues and focus solely on assessing the presence or absence of
certain pathologies in the reports. However, due to the difficulty of comprehensively labeling the data,
the available pathology classes are limited both in diversity and in detail. Currently, the number of
pathologies used for evaluation is only 14, neglecting possible findings beyond these pathologies.
Furthermore, only the existence or absence of a pathology is taken into account, while specifics such
as locations (e.g., "left" vs. "right") and severity (e.g., "small" vs. "mild") are completely disregarded.
These limitations constrain the metrics’ ability to capture overall clinical correctness.

Finally, an additional major drawback in the current situation in this domain is that results are
evaluated separately on these two types of metrics. This raises evaluation ambiguity: what does it
signify if one model demonstrates improved scores in one type of metric but worse scores in the
other? For example, the result of [18] is better than [31] in terms of CE, but worse in terms of NLG
metrics on MIMIC-CXR dataset [16]. Which generative model shall one use?

Indeed, it was demonstrated in [34] that these metrics exhibit a low correlation with radiologist
judgment. In this study, pairs of reference and candidate reports were evaluated by several NLG and
CE metrics and compared to radiologist evaluations. To improve the correlation, it was proposed
to utilize a graph representation of clinical entities and relations [14], and to use it to compute an
additional metric, by measuring the similarity in both the entities and their relationships between a
reference report and a generated report. However, this graph structure is not unique, as evidenced
by the variability between manual annotators, which can potentially lead to inaccurate metrics.
Additionally, normal findings may or may not appear in a report, and their presence or absence can
influence the result, although both scenarios are valid.

We propose a novel metric to measure the correspondence between two reports. The key idea is
that the reports are linked through an associated image, and this image should be taken into account.
Hence, we assess both the textual similarity between the reports and the extent to which they convey
shared clinical information. By utilizing the visual modality, we address several weaknesses inherent

2


---Page Break---
in existing approaches discussed above. These include the separation to two distinct types of metrics,
the overemphasis of general long phrases compared to important concise phrases in NLG metrics, the
consideration of information that cannot be inferred from the image, and the limited diversity and
detail captured by CE metrics. Figure 1 demonstrates the benefits of our proposed metric. When two
reports are semantically very similar but significantly different in terms of text (Figure 1a), common
metrics assign very low scores, whereas our metric manages to capture the high similarity between
the reports. In contrast, when two reports are highly similar textually except for a single word that
holds significant anatomical importance (e.g., left vs. right), as in Figure 1b, common metrics provide
a high score, while our metric is more sensitive to this critical change.

Specifically, our approach is based on the idea that measuring similarity between reports in a joint
visual-textual space expresses aspects of similarity and distinctiveness, which cannot be achieved
in a single modality. This can be explained by the fact that reports conveying equivalent relevant
information, which can be extracted from a given image, are expected to be positioned closely together
within this space. Furthermore, the learned space ensures that a broad spectrum of pathologies and
observations are accommodated, rather than being limited to pre-defined ones. Hence, we compute the
proximity of 3 components in this space – the image, the ground-truth report and the generated report.
We note that a joint embedding space of images and reports has garnered interest in recent years
within the field of representation learning in the medical domain, facilitating tasks such as retrieval
and classification [2, 6, 11, 33, 37]. This is the first time to propose that measuring similarities within
this space provides a robust framework for evaluating how accurately a generated report describes an
image. Additionally, we define a new similarity score in this shared space.

Furthermore, in addition to demonstrating a notably strong alignment of our metric with radiologists’
judgments on ReXVal [34], we introduce a new dataset containing tailored perturbations. These
are designed to examine the sensitivity of evaluation metrics to significant versus insignificant
modifications. Our findings indicate that our metric is sensitive to critical details such as pathologies
or the location of findings, while remaining robust to errors of low significance, such as the omission
of non-clinical phrases.

Hence, our contributions are three-fold:

1. A novel evaluation metric for medical report generation, considering both textual and clinical
aspects. Its key idea is to measure report similarity through their corresponding image.

2. Showing that our metric achieves the strongest alignment with radiologists judgment com-
pared to previous metrics, as well as the highest robustness to the perturbations.

3. A new evaluation dataset containing targeted perturbations designed to reveal weaknesses
and benefits in evaluation metrics for medical report generation.

Related Work

Medical report generation. Medical report generation models aim to produce coherent and accurate
medical reports based on input images. Most research in this field focuses on a paired setup,
where both images and corresponding reports are available for training. Typically, visual features
are encoded using a dedicated encoder module, followed by a decoder that generates the output
report [3, 5, 10, 12, 15, 19, 23, 30, 36]. Additional techniques, such as incorporating knowledge
graphs [17, 21, 36], planning [10], and reinforcement learning [7, 23, 32], are often employed in the
process. Training these models without access to paired data has also garnered attention in other
works [8, 9, 22].

Evaluation metrics for report generation. Evaluation is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of all
the above approaches. Traditional metrics used to measure alignment between two texts (reference
and candidate) rely on n-gram overlap and include BLEU [25], METEOR [1], ROUGE [20] &
CIDEr [28]. These metrics consider exact word or phrase alignments, often overlooking paraphrases
and failing to account for variations in semantic significance. Specialized metrics such as clinical
efficacy (CE) metrics have been developed to measure clinical precision, recall, F1 score, or cosine
similarity. These metrics are typically derived from classification models trained to identify specific
pathologies [13, 26]. While CE metrics assess high-level semantic similarity between reference and
generated reports, they may not fully capture the coherence and overall quality of the generated
reports. Recently, another metric called RadGraph F1 [34] was proposed, which computes overlap

3

between graphs representing clinical entities and relations in both reference and generated reports.
In [34], it is demonstrated that RadGraph, along with the embedding-based metric BERTScore [35],
exhibits relatively high alignment with radiologists’ judgments.

Image-report representation learning. Multi-modal representation learning in the medical domain
is usually focused on Vision Language Pre-training (VLP), aiming to align corresponding images and
texts in the same representation space. These representations can be utilized for various downstream
tasks, such as retrieval, classification and detection. Most of the works in that domain utilize
contrastive learning objectives to align the two modalities. ConVIRT [37] proposed a simple yet
effective model that utilized a global contrastive objective between the image and the corresponding
report. GLoRIA [11], LIMITR [6] & LoVT [24] proposed different methods to utilize the local
connections between the modalities and incorporated them into an additional contrastive objective.
MGCA [29] added a prototype module which introduces disease-level information. Biovil [2] focused
on the language representations and introduced a domain-specific language model. MedCLIP [33]
proposed to replace the contrastive loss with semantic matching loss based on medical knowledge to
eliminate false negatives in contrastive learning.

Proposed Metric

The goal of report generation is to automatically create a free-text description for a clinical image. The
quality of the generated reports should be quantified based on how well the overall information present
in the image is expressed in the report. Currently, evaluation metrics measure the similarity between a
single ground-truth report and the generated report without considering the images, focusing either on
language similarity (NLG metrics) or clinical efficacy (CE metrics). NLG metrics do not account for
the fact that certain sentences or specific words are more crucial than others, although these impact
patient diagnosis and treatment more significantly. CE metrics compare pathologies but are limited
in the types of pathologies they extract and ignore important pathology properties (e.g., location or
severity). Additionally, this approach raises a question: how do we choose a model between two
given ones when one is superior in terms of NLG and the other in terms of CE?

In the light of the limitations of existing metrics, we seek a new metric that quantifies the quality of
a generated report, addressing the following criteria: (1) consideration of both textual and clinical
aspects, (2) recognition that subtle differences between reports may be significant, (3) giving less
weight to information that cannot be extracted from the image (e.g. previous conditions), and
(4) capturing multiple possible findings along with their properties such as locations and severity.

Our key idea is that the similarity between radiology reports should consider the corresponding
radiology image. We propose to quantify the quality of the generated report with respect to both the
information present in the input image and the ground-truth report. To integrate information from
two modalities and compute a similarity score, we implement our idea at two steps. First, we project
the image and reports into a shared space where similarities and differences are trained to be captured.
Second, we propose a novel metric that quantifies quality based on the relationships among three
components: the image, the generated report, and the ground-truth report, as described below.

Multi-modal embedding model.
Medical image-report representation models aim to construct
a joint embedding space where corresponding images and reports are positioned close to each
other, while non-corresponding ones are placed farther apart [6, 11, 37, 2, 33]. These models learn
distinctive features that can be extracted from both the images and the reports. The properties of
these embedding models align with desired properties in medical reports evaluation metrics: (1) As
the embedding model constructs the embedding space to successfully separate non-matching images
and reports, it seeks the differences that matter, even when these are subtle. This is crucial for our
purpose, as subtle differences between reports can distinguish between an excellent report and one
that fails to describe the image. Furthermore, the separation is learned rather than being guided by
pre-defined criteria (e.g., specific 14 pathologies). Therefore, it enables the quantification of the
quality of reports describing a wide range of pathologies and abnormalities. (2) As the model learns
to distinguish between examples within the dataset, it also acquires the ability to overlook general
information lacking discriminative value. This property is important for an evaluation metric as it
allows the metric to prioritize the extraction of pertinent clinical details from the input image.

Our approach can function with any shared space embedding model. However, we prioritize precise
image-report retrieval-oriented models, i.e., finding the exact match from one modality given the

4

other, as this aligns with our goal. Precise retrieval relies on matching fine details, which necessitates
shared information, both local and global, within the image and report. Other focuses of embedding
models are often on downstream tasks such as classification or segmentation, where the focus on
specific pathologies usually suffices. Therefore, we chose to employ the model of [6], which focuses
on image-text and text-image retrieval, rather than on other downstream tasks. Its utilization aligns
well with the task of evaluating report generation, which entails quantifying the accuracy of diverse
descriptions contained within the report. Section 4 demonstrates the model’s benefit for our needs by
showing its superior alignment with radiologists’ judgment compared to other embedding models.

Report-report similarity evaluation.
Given the embedding vectors of an image, a generated report,
and a ground-truth report, our aim is to define a similarity score between them. There are various
alternatives for such a score, as discussed in Section 4.3.

We define the similarity as the area of the triangle created by the three high-dimensional points (i.e.,
the embedding vectors). Intuitively, this area takes into account the proximity to each other in the
embedding space of all pairs of points in this triplet. Formally, for an image i, a generated report g,
and a ground-truth report r, mapped by the embedding model Emb to ie, ge, re respectively, their
proximity is computed using the following triangle area formula, utilizing the inner product ⟨·, ·⟩:

T(i, g, r) = 1

2

p

⟨ie −ge, ie −ge⟩⟨ie −re, ie −re⟩−⟨ie −ge, ie −re⟩2
(1)

Since the embedding model is designed to position the image and the two reports that correspond
to the same image close to each other in the embedding space, lower values of this measurement
indicate a higher level of similarity between the reports and the image.

To normalize the measure to the range of [0, 1], where 0 indicates low similarity and 1 represents
high similarity, the final quality score is defined as:

V LScore(i, g, r) = max
n
1 −T(i, g, r)

C
, 0
o
,
(2)

where C is a constant. We set it to C = 890 to suit the maximal value of Equation 1 (representing the
largest triangle area) for the baseline dataset [34], which comprises pairs of diverse quality. Therefore,
this choice is compatible across a variety of datasets.

Experimental Analysis

We analyze our proposed metric by comparing its alignment with radiologists’ judgment and by using
a controlled dataset to demonstrate the domain sensitivity of the various metrics across different error
types. Further details on the experiments and findings are provided below.

4.1
Radiologist-judgement data

This experiment aims to assess the agreement between evaluation metrics and the actual ratings
of certified radiologists. We expect good evaluation metrics to show strong correlation with the
assessments of radiologists, who have extensive experience in interpreting medical reports and
defining report accuracy. A low correlation would raise concerns about the validity of the metric,
since its scores would diverge from the opinions of radiologists, the experts in this field.

Dataset. The recent work of [34] introduces an evaluation dataset, called Radiology Report Expert
Evaluation (ReXVal), comprising 200 pairs of reports. Each pair consists of a reference report (drawn
from the MIMIC-CXR training set) and a candidate report retrieved as the best match from the same
dataset, according to one of the following automated metrics: BLEU, BERTScore, CheXbert, and
RadGraph F1. Each pair was annotated by 6 board-certified radiologists, who provide the number
of errors in the candidate report across several error categories, such as omission of finding or false
location of finding. These annotations generate a rating for each pair of reports based on the number
of errors identified by the radiologists.

Correlation score. The alignment between the different metric scores (previous metrics & ours) and
the radiologist scores assigned to the same reports is quantified using the Kendall rank correlation
coefficient (τ), as proposed in [34]. This coefficient assesses the degree of similarity in the ordering of

CheXpert (Cp), CheXbert (Cb), and RadGraph F1 (RG).

ranks assigned by the metrics and radiologists. In this context, a high correlation coefficient indicates
that the ranking produced by a given metric closely resembles the ranking assigned by radiologists.
The agreement with radiologists is important to indicate the extent to which each metric captures the
perceived quality or clinical relevance of the reports as assessed by experts. This means the metric
effectively identifies which report-reference pairs are considered better or worse.

Results. Table 1 shows the correlation between common evaluation metrics and our proposed metric
to the judgment of radiologists. Our correlation coefficient (τ = 0.718) is much higher than the
classical evaluations (e.g., B-4 with τ = 0.345) and the recently proposed metric of RadGraph F1
(RG , τ = 0.515). This can be explained by radiologists’ focus on the diagnostic significance of
textual differences rather than on mere textual overlap. Our approach aims to achieve a similar focus,
which contributes to the higher correlation we observe.

4.2
Perturbed data

In the medical domain, the single dataset with human judgement is of [34], which we used in
Section 4.1 for metric assessment. We propose to add another dateset, a perturbed dataset, which will
assess the robustness of the different metrics to several properties crucial for quantifying the accuracy
of generated medical reports. This dataset is of a larger scale and contains targeted perturbations that
address several weaknesses that may arise in evaluation metrics and are present in generated reports.

Toward this end, we sampled a subset of 440 pairs of images and reports from the validation and
test sets of MIMIC-CXR. For this subset, we manually applied six types of modifications to the
accompanying reports. This resulted in 979 triplets, each includes an image, the ground-truth report
and the perturbed report. The dataset will be released, with samples provided in the supplementals.

In order to quantify the quality of the metrics and assess for which modifications the metrics are
robust or sensitive, we compare the behavior of each evaluation metric for each modification type.
We discuss each pertubation and experiment below.

Removal of pathology sentence vs. insignificant sentence. Different sentences in medical reports
carry varying levels of significance. Those that describe the pathologies and diagnosis are central to
the essence of the report, making their presence crucial in the generated report, while other sentences
may be of lower significance. To evaluate the sensitivity of the evaluation metrics to sentences with
varying importance, we removed sentences from the ground-truth report, as follows. In the first case,
we examine the effect of a missing pathology by omitting the sentence that indicates it. Clinically,
this difference is dramatic as it represents a major error in image analysis. Consequently, we expect
the metrics to penalize considerably. In this case, we obtained 238 examples.

In the second case, we removed general sentences that are irrelevant to the analysis of the given
image. Such sentences could include common phrases that may or may not appear in reports (e.g., "a
chest radiograph") or phrases related to the actions taken by the doctor (e.g., "called the nurse"). We
do not expect a model to generate these sentences based on a given image. Therefore, we aim for the
metric to be immune to the presence or absence of these phrases. We obtained 119 such examples.

Table 2 shows the average similarity scores given by each metric for each one of these perturbation
types and their difference (∆). A metric should penalize clinical errors more than general sentences.
However, both perturbations influence NLG metrics similarly (the difference in the similarity scores
between the two is approximately 0), which shows their weak sensitivity to clinical details. This
behavior is expected as these metrics quantify the presence or absence of sequences of words without
consideration of context and sentence importance. On the other hand, both CE metrics and our metric
are aware of the clinical aspects and are affected differently by the two perturbations. For CE metrics,

Table 2: Results on perturbed dataset: Removing pathology vs. insignificant sentences. When
removing a pathology, the score should drop, while when omitting a general sentence, it should
change only slightly. NLG metrics result in similar scores in both cases; however, CE and our metric
penalize the score in accordance with the importance. Our metric shows the highest sensitivity.

shows high sensitivity. Moreover, all previous metrics set a high score (close to 1) to the perturbed
report, suggesting it is near perfect, although a critical error was made.

which assess the overlap of clinical entities between two reports, removing the pathology description
greatly impact their similarity results. Yet, our metric exhibits the highest sensitivity in this case
(the highest ∆). It is derived from the nature of our metric relying on discriminative visual and
textual information. This is so since the embedding model utilizes clinical information from both
the image and the report, mapping them to close or distant locations in a shared space. General
information shared across multiple studies is assigned less weight in this mapping process, as it does
not contribute significantly to the differentiation between radiology studies.

Modification of pathology description word vs. non-informative word. In medical reports, single
words, often those that describe the pathology, can significantly alter the diagnosis. To assess the
sensitivity of the evaluation metrics to changes in such words, we modified a single word describing
either the location or severity of the pathology. The modifications regarding the location of the
pathology include alterations to other anatomical locations (e.g., basal to apical) and swaps between
left and right. As for the severity of the pathology, we modified the severity level. To establish a
baseline for this evaluation, we also replaced non-informative words (e.g., "the" / "this" / "there")
by the [UNK] token. We anticipate that a change in the pathology description will exert a greater
influence on the metrics than a change in non-informative words. We obtained 187 examples for the
location change, 95 for the severity change and 133 for the non-informative word change.

Table 3 presents the difference (∆) of each metric for the significant perturbations (location or
severity) relative to the non-informative word change. As before, NLG metrics are unaware of
the significance of the words. The scores are similar for both significant and non-significant word
perturbations. Additionally, for all these perturbations, most of the scores (all but METEOR) are
very close to 1, suggesting almost perfect similarity, although the clinical difference caused by the
perturbations (e.g., mislocating a finding) are very significant. CE metrics also fail to recognize
the significance of these perturbations. The difference to the non-informative word perturbations
for these metrics is low, and the absolute scores are relatively high (close to 1), demonstrating the
low sensitivity of these metrics to such errors. This is explained by the fact that these metrics often
focus on the existence of findings but not their details. Our metric, however, is aware of these subtle
differences and their importance, due to the contrastive-based design of the shared space we operate
within, leading to a penalty in the score compared to the change of a non-informative word.

Modification of reports without findings. There is no single structure for medical reports. Conse-
quently, a radiology image can be described in various ways depending on factors such as the patient’s

Figure 2: Scores of equivalent normal reports. When comparing two reports with no findings,
the score is expected to be high, as both convey the same clinical findings with differences only in
the writing of the report. Compared to BLEU-4 (a) and RadGraph F1 (b), our metric yields high
scores (right-side), while the other metrics yield low scores (bottom-side). BERTScore (c) provides
mid-range scores instead of high scores. CheXpert (d) provides higher scores than the others, yet
lower scores than our metric, although it was expected to yield scores close to 1 as both reports in
each pair contain no findings.

history or the radiologist’s style and focus. However, the core purpose of the report – diagnosing
abnormalities and recognizing normal findings, whether explicitly or implicitly – should remain
consistent. To demonstrate the robustness of metrics to these variations, we specifically select studies
with normal findings only. We created a standardized general report representing studies with no
findings by compiling the most common sentences from the dataset associated with reports lacking
abnormalities. Then, for each image corresponding to a report with no abnormalities, we pair it with
this constructed report (see example in Figure 1a). In total, we obtain 207 such examples. In this
experiment, we expect a metric to exhibit robustness to the exact wording and to discern the clinical
meaning of the report. Specifically, the metric score should be relatively high.

Figure 2 compares the scores of our metric to those given by four other metrics. BLEU-4 and
RadGraph F1 assign these examples a low score, particularly for BLEU-4 the average is 0.15 and
for RadGraph F1 is 0.23, whereas BERTScore yields mid-level results with an average of 0.51. This
occurs because BLEU and RadGraph are sensitive to the exact wording, while BERTScore exhibits
some robustness to words with similar meanings. CheXbert, which is a CE metric, is expected to
assign very high scores in this case, as all the reports should be classified with no findings. Yet, its
average is only 0.63. The other CE metric, CheXpert (F1), which directly measures classification
accuracy, does behave as expected with an average of 0.91. Our scores are predominantly high, with
an average of 0.85, comparable to CheXpert and surpass all other methods, as we do not rely solely
on text similarity but rather on information that is mutual to the visual and textual modalities, with
semantics captured in the shared space. Other metrics demonstrate undesirable behavior as those
depicted in Figure 2: BLEU-1 0.33, METEOR 0.18, ROUGE-L 0.33.

Ablation study

Similarity measurements. Given three embedding vectors–one for the ground-truth report re, one
for the generated report ge, and one for the input image ie—Table 4 presents the results of several
alternative similarity measurements. For all the measures, we examine the correlation with the
ranking of radiologists, using the Kendall correlation coefficient. The first measure considers only re
and ge, and the others consider also the image embedding ie. These measures are: (1) The cosine
similarity between re and ge. This distance implicitly considers the image as part of the construction
of the shared space, but not in the computation of the metric. (2) The radius of the minimal bounding
sphere measures the density of the three points in the high dimensional space by estimating the
minimal bounding sphere of these three points. (3) Image centered cosine similarity is the cosine
similarity between the difference vectors re-ie and ge-ie. The difference between this similarity and
the vanilla cosine similarity is the origin, i.e. whether it is the ⃗0 vector or the image vector. (4) Our
metric: the area of the triangle created by the three high-dimensional points (embedding vectors).

Table 4 shows that the results by these measurements, which are all based explicitly or implicitly on
connections with visual information, are all superior to the previous methods presented in Table 1,
which are purely textual. Furthermore, the relative position of the image in the embedding space to
the two reports is useful for the similarity measurement, as evident by the higher correlation achieved
in the image-centered cosine similarity compared to the regular cosine similarity (0.678 vs. 0.555).

In addition, when considering the Euclidean distances between the points and not only the angles
between them, as captured by the triangle area, the correlation boosts (0.718). The minimal bounding
sphere shows relatively low correlation (0.525), possibly due to the exponential growth of its volume
in high dimensions. Intuitively, bounding spheres might contain mostly empty volume.

Embedding models. Recall that we used LIMITR [6] as our multi-modal embedding model due to
its focus on precise retrieval tasks, as well as extracting discriminative representations at both local
and global levels. Table 5 confirms that this model outperforms other multi-modal embedding models.
LIMITR embeddings demonstrate the highest correlation with radiologists’ rankings compared to
ConVIRT [37], BioViL [2], MedCLIP [33], and GLoRIA [11] (the C values set for these models are
124, 1, 0.06, and 1155, respectively). This may be explained by the fact that LIMITR is optimized
for retrieval tasks, excelling at matching a single image with a specific report, while the other models
prioritize downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, which may be less precise for
capturing nuances relevant for evaluation purposes. Since our metric relies on strong alignment
between the image and the entire report to assess the quality of generated reports, the emphasis of
LIMITR on alignment-focused tasks aligns well with our evaluation criteria.

Results on report generation models. We have shown the benefit of our metric on evaluation
datasets. In the supplementary materials we show similar advantages on reports generates by SoTA
report generation models, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Limitations. The constant C utilized in Eq. 2 is determined based on a representative dataset and
is applicable to all datasets within the domain. It serves the purpose of normalizing the size of the
triangle to the range [0, 1] (if desired), as the size of the triangle is unbounded. In different domains,
such as other imaging sources, the value of C will need to be determined accordingly.

Societal impact. The high correlation of our metric with radiologists’ judgment may result in
overreliance on automated systems, which are prone to errors. If a metric leads to increased reliance
on automated systems for generating medical reports, there is a risk that healthcare professionals may
become overly dependent on these technologies. This could potentially lead to a reduction in critical
thinking and clinical judgment, as well as a loss of the human touch in patient care. Therefore, while
this metric can be used to quantify the quality of automated systems, their utilization in real-world
practice should be carefully supervised.

Conclusions

This paper introduces a novel evaluation metric, V LScore, for automatic medical report generation
from X-ray images. It addresses shortcomings found in current evaluation methods, which either
focus solely on textual similarities, neglecting clinical considerations, or concentrate solely on one
clinical aspect, such as pathology, while disregarding all other facets. The main idea behind our
metric is to assess the similarity between radiology reports in relation to their corresponding radiology
image. The metric measures similarity in a joint visual-textual space, according to the triplet of
embeddings, of the image, the ground-truth report, and the generated report. We demonstrate the
strength of our metric compared to previous metrics both qualitatively and quantitatively; for instance,
it improves the correlation with radiologists’ judgments by 20% on the ReXVal dataset. In addition,

we propose a new dataset for metric evaluation, featuring thoughtfully crafted perturbations that
differentiate between substantial modifications (e.g., omitting a diagnosis) and less significant ones.
