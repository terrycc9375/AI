Abstract

Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the
requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance opti-
mization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these
issues, we present HumanSplat, which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting proper-
ties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. Specifically,
HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction
Transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and
semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates
human semantic information is devised to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling
and impose stronger constraints on the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive
experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that
HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic
novel-view synthesis. Project page: https://humansplat.github.io.

Introduction

Realistic 3D human reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer vision with widespread applica-
tions in numerous fields, including social media, gaming, e-commerce, telepresence, etc. Previous
works for single-image human reconstruction can be broadly categorized into explicit and implicit
approaches. Explicit methods [1, 2, 3, 4], such as those based on parametric body models like
SMPL [5, 6], estimate human meshes by directly optimizing parameters and clothing offset to fit the
observed image. However, these methods often struggle with complex clothing styles and require
lengthy optimization. Implicit methods [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] represent humans using continuous functions,
such as occupancy [7], SDF [12], and NeRF [13]. While they excel at modeling flexible topology,
these methods are limited in scalability and efficiency due to the high computational cost associated
with training and inference. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14] have provided a
balance between efficiency and rendering quality for reconstructing detailed 3D human models, which
however rely on multi-view image [15, 16, 17] or monocular video [18, 19, 20] input. Recent popular
human reconstruction studies [21, 22, 23, 24] focus on the score distillation sampling (SDS) tech-
nique [25] to lift 2D diffusion priors to 3D, but time-consuming optimization (e.g., 2 hours) is required
for each instance. Some generalizable and large-reconstruction-model-based works [10, 26, 27, 28]
can directly generalize the regression of 3D representations but either disregard human priors or
require multi-view inputs, limiting the stability and feasibility in downstream applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable approach HumanSplat for single-image human
reconstruction by introducing a generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework with a fine-tuned 2D
multi-view diffusion model and well-conceived 3D human structure priors. Different from existing
human 3DGS methods, our approach directly infers Gaussian properties from a single input image,

(a) Qualitative results: LGM [29] and GTA [30] are generalizable but in lower quality, TeCH [21]
exhibits issues with multi-face rendering and is time-consuming. In contrast, our method achieves
higher fidelity in a much shorter time. (b) Performance and runtime comparison: metrics are evaluated
on the challenging Twindom dataset.

eliminating the requirement for per-instance optimization or densely captured images. This empowers
our method to generalize effectively in diverse scenarios while delivering high-quality reconstructions.

The key insight behind our method is to reconstruct Gaussian properties from the diffusion latent space
in a generalizable end-to-end architecture, integrating a 2D generative diffusion model as appearance
prior and a human parametric model as structure prior. Specifically, facing this under-constraint
reconstruction problem from single-view input with extensive invisible regions, we first leverage a
2D multi-view diffusion model (denoted as novel-view synthesizer) to hallucinate the unseen parts
of clothed humans. Then a generalizable latent reconstruction Transformer is proposed to enable
interaction among the generated diffusion latent embeddings and the geometric information of the
structured human model, enhancing the quality of 3DGS reconstruction. During interactions, to
mitigate the limitations of inaccurate human priors like the SMPL model, we devise a projection
strategy to strike a balance between robustness and flexibility, projecting 3D tokens into the 2D
space and conducting searches within adjacent windows using projection-aware attention. Another
specific challenge of human reconstruction is to capture fine detail in visually sensitive areas, such as
the face and hand. To address this problem, we exploit the semantic cues from the structure priors
and propose semantics-guided objectives to further promote the fine details reconstruction quality.
By synergistically amalgamating these crucial components into a unified framework, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in striking the right balance between quality and efficiency.

In summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows:

• We propose a novel generalizable human Gaussian Splatting network for high-fidelity human
reconstruction from a single image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to leverage
latent Gaussian reconstruction with a 2D generative diffusion model in an end-to-end
framework for efficient and accurate single-image human reconstruction.

• We integrate structure and appearance cues within a universal Transformer framework by
leveraging human geometry priors from the SMPL model and human appearance priors from
the 2D generative diffusion model. Geometric priors stabilize the generation of high-quality
human geometry, while appearance prior helps hallucinate unseen parts of clothed humans.

• We enhance the fidelity of reconstructed human models by introducing semantic cues,
hierarchical supervision, and tailored loss functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods.

minimally clothed human meshes [1, 2, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], adding clothing via 3D offsets [3,
4, 38, 39, 40, 41] or garment templates [42, 43, 44]. However, these methods are constrained
by topology, particularly with loose clothing. Implicit methods [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 22, 27, 45, 46],
utilizing representations like occupancy, signed distance fields (SDF) and Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF), offer flexibility with topology, allowing for accurate depiction of 3D clothed humans. Recent
methods [30, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61] combine implicit representation
with explicit human priors for better robustness. Among these, GTA [30] uses Transformers with
fixed embeddings for translating image features into 3D tri-plane features. TeCH [62] employs
diffusion-based models for visualizing unseen areas but needs extensive optimization and accurate
SMPL-X models. Another approach, HumanSGD [22], uses diffusion models for texture inpainting
but struggles with mesh inaccuracies from [8]. NeRF-based methods like SHERF [10] generate
human NeRF from single images using hierarchical features, while ELICIT [11] leverages CLIP [63]
for contextual understanding. These NeRF-based methods produce high-quality images but often
struggle with detailed 3D mesh generation and require extensive optimization time.

Human Gaussian Splatting. While implicit representations like SDF or NeRF struggle with
balance optimization efficiency and rendering quality, the high efficiency of 3DGS [14] has advanced
3D human creation. Recent 3DGS methods have targeted multi-view videos, monocular video
sequences, and sparse-view input. Multi-view video methods like D3GA [15], HuGS [16], and
3DGS-Avatar [17] exploit dense spatial and temporal information for detailed models. Additionally,
HiFi4G [64] combine 3DGS with a dual-graph mechanism to preserve spatial-temporal consistency,
ASH [65] utilizes mesh UV parameterization for real-time rendering, and Animatable Gaussians [66]
improve garment dynamics via pose projection mechanism and 2D CNNs. The monocular video
only provides sufficient observation as humans move, so the monocular human Gaussian Splatting
methods [18, 19, 20, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73] often resort to using LBS for mapping to a canonical
space and introducing additional regularization terms. For sparse-view images, GPS-Gaussian [28]
achieves high rendering speeds without per-subject optimization by using a feed-forward way with
efficient 2D CNNs encoding from diverse 3D human scan data. In comparison, our work stands out
as the first one-shot generalizable human GS method, using only single image input and achieving
high-quality reconstruction without any optimization and fine-tuning.

Generalizable Large Reconstrucion Model. Large reconstruction model (LRM) [74, 75] presents
that with sufficient parameters and training datasets, a deterministic feed-forward Transformer [76] is
capable of learning a triplane feature for volumetric rendering from a single-view image. Targeting
general 3D object, TriplaneGaussian [77] combines 3DGS with triplane as a hybrid 3D representation
for fast rendering, where point clouds are first extracted from an image and then projected on triplane
features to decode 3DGS attributes. Most recent methods further leverage 2D diffusion models that
can generate multi-view images simultaneously [78, 79, 80, 81] to provide plausible and abundant
inputs for the following reconstruction, so they focus on the sparse multi-view reconstruction task.
Instant3D [81] follows the technique of LRM and produces triplane features from 4 posed images by
a Transformer encoder. CRM [82], MeshLRM [83] and InstantMesh [84] replaces triplane NeRF
by FlexiCubes [85] to extract meshes directly. LGM [29], GRM [86] and GS-LRM [87] predict
3DGS attributes from each input pixel [88, 89] and combine the Gaussians from multiple viewpoints
as the final 3D output. For human task, CharacterGen [90] follows Instant3D [81] to adopt a two-
stage approach: first, generating a 2D multi-view canonical images, then using multi-view SDF
reconstruction for cartoon digital characters, without direct interaction between stages. A more
compact and elegant method HumanLRM [27] replaces training data of LRM [74] from general
objects with human data to predict triplane NeRF, showcasing the capacities of the large model.
While it relies heavily on the dataset, often leading to issues like missing limbs due to a lack of prior
knowledge. In contrast, our 3DGS-based method leverages the latent diffusion and reconstruction
model in an end-to-end framework and introduces human priors by addressing their inaccuracy with
specific projection strategies, achieving better generalization and stability with even less data.

Overview

Given a single input image of a human body I0 ∈RH×W ×3, our task is to reconstruct a 3D
representation, i.e., 3DGS in this work, from which novel-view images can be rendered. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, our method leverages a 2D diffusion model and a novel latent reconstruction Transformer
that adeptly integrates 2D appearance priors, human geometric priors, and semantic cues within a
universal framework. First, we use SMPL estimator [91, 92] to predict human structure priors M,
and CLIP [63] to generate the image embedding of the input image c. A latent temporal-spatial
diffusion model [93], referred to as the novel-view synthesizer (Sec. 3.3), is fine-tuned and produces
multi-view latent features

Fi ∈Rh×w×c	N
i=1, where N is the number of views, and h, w and c are
the height, width and channel of the latent features. Then, we utilize a novel latent reconstruction
Transformer (Sec. 3.4) that adeptly integrates human geometric prior and latent features within a
universal framework, which predicts Gaussian attributes G := {(µi, qi, si, ci, σi)|i = 1, ..., Np}
and rendered into new images, where Np represents the number of Gaussian points. Furthermore, to
achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views, we designed
a hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic priors (See 3.5). Note that during training, the
network is trained using 3D scan data to ensure accurate supervision from various viewpoints, where
the registered SMPL is fitted via the multi-view version of SMPLify [92]. During inference, the
model employs PIXIE [91] to predict human structure priors M and synthesize novel views from
only a single image input based on the trained model, without any fine-tuning and optimization.

3.3
Video Diffusion Model as Novel-view Synthesizer

We take advantage of the pre-trained video diffusion model SV3D [93] as appearance prior. For
the input image I0, we leverage a CLIP image encoder [63] to obtain the image embedding c and a
pre-trained VAE [94] E to acquire latent feature F0 as conditions. Subsequently, we progressively
denoises gaussian noises into temporal-continuous N multi-view latent features {Fi}N
i=1 by a spatial-
temporal UNet Dθ [95] with the objective:

Eϵ∼p(ϵ)

i=1, c, F0, ϵ) −{Fi}N

where {Fϵ
i}N
i=1 is the noise-corrupted multi-view latent features, {ei, ai}N
i=1 is the corresponding
relative elevation and azimuth angles to I0, p(ϵ) is the noise probability distribution and λ(ϵ) ∈R+ is
the loss weighting term related to the noise level ϵ. Since SV3D is merely pre-trained on the dataset
of objects [96], we further fine-tune it using human datasets to improve its effectiveness in the human
reconstruction task. More technical details are available in Appendix A.1.

3.4
Latent Reconstruction Transformer

Latent reconstruction Transformer contains two parts: latent embedding interaction (Sec. 3.4.1) and
geometry-aware interaction (Sec. 3.4.2), which seamlessly incorporate latent features from novel-
view synthesizer and human structure priors into the reconstruction process. The two components
together form a cohesive framework for accurately recovering intricate human details.

3.4.1
Latent Embedding Interaction

We utilize a pretrained VAE [94] encoder E to encode the input image I0 into a latent represen-
tation F0 = E(I0) ∈Rh×w×c and combine it with the generated {Fi}N
i=1 (Sec. 3.3). Following
previous works [97, 98], latent representations are concatenated with their corresponding Plücker
embeddings [99] along the channel dimension, resulting in a dense pose-conditioned feature map.
These latents are then divided into non-overlapping patches [100] and mapped to d-dimensional
latent tokens by a linear layer. An intra-attention module is followed to thoroughly extract spatial
correlations of latent tokens, as shown in Fig. 3, by a standard Transformer [76] with Nintra blocks of
multi-head self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN):

¯Fi = [FFN(SelfAttention(Fi))]×Nintra.
(2)

3.4.2
Geometry-aware Interaction

Human Geometric Tokenizer. Given a human geometric model M ∈R6890×3, to obtain the feature
representation, we project M onto the input view and compute the feature vector through bilinear
interpolation on the feature grids by

Π0(M) = K (R0M + t0) ,
(3)

where R0, t0 are camera extrinsic parameters of the input view, K is the intrinsic parameters.
After the projection operation, we obtain geometric human prior tokens by concatenating M and
F0[Π0(M)], and mapping them to d dimension. F0[Π0(M)] stands for querying the input latent
feature F0 from projected locations. Similar to Latent Embedding Interaction (Sec. 3.4.1), an intra-
attention module is utilized to interact among these human prior tokens and get human geometric
features ¯H ∈R6890×d.

Human Geometry-aware Attention. Empirically, we find that incorporating human priors [5, 6, 101]
(e.g., SMPL model) into human reconstruction faces a significant dilemma of the trade-off between
robustness and flexibility [30, 102]. On the one hand, the SMPL model provides geometric priors
that alleviate common issues (e.g., broken body parts and various artifacts). On the other hand, it
struggles to accurately capture and represent a broad spectrum of complex clothing styles, particularly
more fluid garments like dresses and skirts. This limitation highlights a fundamental shortcoming
in the model’s capacity to accurately depict diverse apparel. As shown in Fig. 3, HumanSplat
addresses inaccuracies in human priors by projecting 3D tokens into 2D space and conducting
local searches within adjacent windows, efficiently using priors while minimizing redundancy.
Specifically, we introduce projection-aware attention within the inter-attention module, utilizing a
window W(Kwin ×Kwin) and employing masked multi-head cross-attention. Here, the latent features
¯Fi
	N
i=1 serve as queries, and the human prior tokens ¯H serve as keys and values. The process can
be formulated as follows:

{˜Fi}N
i=1 = [FFN(CrossAttentionmask({¯Fi}N
i=1, ¯H))]×Ninter,
(4)

where feature interactions occur when Π( ¯H, K, Ri, ti) is within the window of ¯Fi. It is noteworthy
that the complexity of the cross-attention operation is reduced from O(LF × LH) to O(LF × K2
win),
compared to the vanilla multi-head cross-attention setting, where LF and LH represent the lengths
of the latent and human geometric tokens respectively.

Novel-view Synthesizer

Figure 3: Illustration of latent reconstruction Transformer. It first divides F0 and Fi into non-
overlapping patches, which are then processed through an intra-attention module (Sec. 3.4.1). Within
the iter-attention module (Sec. 3.4.2), we introduce the projection-aware attention with a window
W(Kwin × Kwin), and the attributes of 3D Gaussians are decoded with a Conv 1 × 1 layer.

3.5
Semantics-guided Objectives

From each output token ˜Fi, we decode the attributes of pixel-aligned Gaussians G in the corre-
sponding patch by a convolutional layer with a 1 × 1 kernel. These attributes are used to render
novel-view images through 3D Gaussian Splatting rasterization. An ideal training objective should
ensure that the rendered outputs closely match the supervised images, striving for overall consistency
between the reconstructed renderings and the ground truth. However, human attention tends to
be particularly focused on facial regions, where intricate details play a pivotal role in perception.
Therefore, to enhance the fidelity of reconstructed human models, we optimize our objective functions
to preferentially focus on the facial regions.

Hierarchical Loss. Traditional approaches often overlook the semantic richness inherent in human
anatomy, leading to reconstructions that lack crucial details and accuracy. To address this, we propose
a novel framework that harnesses semantic cues, hierarchical supervision, and tailored loss functions
to guide the training process. This ensures that not only are the overall structures of the human body
accurately represented, but also that critical areas such as the face are reconstructed with exceptional
detail and fidelity. Specifically, by incorporating a human prior model equipped with semantic
information, which adheres to the widely-used definition of 24 human body parts, such as “right
hand”, “left hand”, “head”, etc. The ground-truth body part segmentation is obtained from SMPL
meshes with predefined semantic vertices [103]. Therefore, we can utilize different attention weights
for different body parts and render different levels of real images from different viewpoints to provide
hierarchical supervision. This approach significantly facilitates the precise localization of essential
body parts, including the head, hands and arms. Please refer to Appendix A.2 for more detailed
procedural insights. The overall loss is defined as a weighted sum of part-specific losses:

LH = 1

where i ∈{1, ..., n} and j ∈{1, ..., m} denote different resolution levels and human parts. ˆIi,j and
Ii,j are the predicted and ground-truth data for part j, λi and λj are weighting factors that reflect
the relative importance of each resolution level and each body part, respectively. LMSE measures the
MSE loss and Lp measures the perceptual loss [104].

Reconstruction Loss. Reconstruction loss LRec based on the Nrender rendered multi-view images is
defined as

Implementation Details

Training Details. HumanSplat is trained on 500 THuman2.0 [105], 1500 2K2K [109], and 1500
Twindom [106] high-fidelity human scans. We evenly position 36 cameras across each of three
hierarchical cycles to capture the full body, half body, and face, with rendering resolution set to
512 × 512. We conduct 200 epochs of 256-res training with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size
of 32 over 2 days on 8 A100 (40G VRAM) GPUs, while 512-res finetuning costs 2 additional days.
We train our model with AdamW [110] optimizer, whose β1, β2 are set to 0.9 and 0.95 respectively.
A weight decay of 0.05 is used on all parameters except those of the LayerNorm layers. We use a
cosine learning rate decay scheduler with a 2000-step linear warm-up and the peak learning rate is set
to 4e-4. For parts related to the head, hands, and arms, λj are set to 2, while the rest human part are
set to 1. The parameters λi, λp and λm are set to 1. The model is trained for 80K iterations on 256-res
and then fine-tuned on 512-res for another 20K iterations. To enable efficient training and inference,
we adopt Flash-Attention-v2 [111] in the xFormers [112] library, gradient checkpointing [113], and
FP16 mixed-precision [114]. Fine-tuning the novel view synthesizer takes about 18 hours. Please
refer to Appendix A.1 for more details about novel view synthesizer fine-tuning.

Inference Time. The video diffusion model takes about 9s to generate multi-view latent features
while the subsequent latent reconstruction for 3DGS takes only about 0.3s. Additionally, it can
render novel views at a rate exceeding 150 FPS on a NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Comparison

Quantitative Comparison. We conduct a quantitative comparison on 21 THuman2.0 [105] and 51
Twindom [106] scans, rendering textured meshes from multiple angles and using PSNR, SSIM [115],
and VGG-LPIPS [104] as evaluation metrics. To ensure fairness, we fine-tune LGM [29] on our
datasets and fully optimize each TeCH [21] instance for comparison. As shown in Tab. 1, HumanSplat
consistently outperforms previous generalizable methods across all datasets. Specifically, HumanSplat
surpasses SIFU [102] by +1.92 (8.72%) in PSNR and reduces LPIPS from 0.079 to 0.055. Notably,
HumanSplat also excels on the more challenging Twindom dataset, outperforming TeCH [21] by
+2.15 (10.16%) in PSNR and reducing LPIPS from 0.188 to 0.125. Although the values can further
decrease with model training, we control the convergence to the current extent in the dataset for better
generalization under more general in-the-wild scenarios. Besides, we also report the reconstruction
times for 512 × 512 input images on a NVIDIA A100 GPU. HumanSplat achieves a remarkably fast
reconstruction time, approximately 9.3 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, making it much
more practical than TeCH’s 4.5-hour reconstruction time.

Qualitative Comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, by incorporating semantics-guided
objectives, Humansplat achieves more detailed and higher fidelity results against GTA [30] and

Figure 4: Qualitative comparison of ours against TeCH [21], GTA [30] and LGM [29] on Thu-
man2.0 [105], Twindom [106] and in-the-wild images. Our method achieves the highest quality. Note
that TeCH achieves clearer results but fails to preserve the face identity.

LGM [29]. Although TeCH [21] also generates high-quality images, its SDS optimization often
results in overly saturated multi-face outcomes [116, 117]. Moreover, while TeCH delivers the
highest PSNR on the Thuman2.0 dataset, the LPIPS metric in Tab. 1, confirms that our method
provides more realistic results. As shown in Fig. 6, Humansplat outperforms HumanSGD on in-
the-wild images from Adobe Stock, effectively predicting 3D Gaussian Splatting properties without
per-instance optimization. Notably, the results on in-the-wild images further demonstrate our strong
generalization capability and our model provides superior textures on both the front and invisible
regions, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating appearance and geometric priors.

Ablation Study

Latent Reconstruction Transformer. HumanSplat leverages the Stable Diffusion latent space
for feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing the compact latent space for
reconstructions leads to better rendering quality compared to using the pixel space, as detailed in

Tab. 2 (a). We also find that patching in the time dimension for latent decoding by temporal VAE [95]
adversely affects the quality, so we employ the vanilla VAE [94] decoder in this work.

Human Geometric Prior. Tab. 2 (b) illustrates the significance of human geometric prior in our
approach. By utilizing SMPL as the geometric prior for human representation, we assess the robust-
ness of HumanSplat with respect to different SMPL parameters. We report both the estimated [2]
and Ground Truth SMPL parameters [92] and compare the model that does not incorporate a human
structure prior. These experiments provide insight into the benefit of incorporating a human structure
prior, as significant performance degradation is observed without it. Furthermore, thanks to treat
human priors as keys and values, HumanSplat exhibits robustness in testing against challenging
poses with imperfect estimation, with only minor declines in metrics. The effectiveness of the human
geometric prior is also demonstrated qualitatively in Fig. 7 (a).

Window Size. As analyzed in Sec. 3.4.2, human priors are crucial for the robustness of the human
reconstruction model. As evidenced in Tab. 2 (c), when the window size Kwin is set to 1 (dubbed
“Projection Only”), employing human priors significantly enhances performance, improving the
PSNR metric from 22.635 to 23.333. We further explore setting window size to Kwin = 2 in a latent
space with a resolution of 64 × 64, which further improves the model’s PSNR metric from 23.333 to
24.294. This improvement is attributed to Humansplat with Kwin = 2 is capable of handling loose
clothing and tolerating imprecise SMPL parameters. In Tab. 3, we present results for the 2K2K
dataset across various window sizes. Further refinement with a window size of Kwin = 3 continues
to enhance the results, whereas using Kwin = 4 does not yield additional improvements.

Semantics-guided Training Objectives. Thanks to the incorporation of semantic-guided hierarchical
losses, HumanSplat can generate higher-quality textures for both the face and hand, while also
promoting the convergence of the training process, as depicted in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). Furthermore,
Fig. 7 (c) demonstrates that HumanSplat further produces 3D coherent segmentation results, which
have potential applications in editing and specific generation of individual parts of 3D humans.

Conclusion

We present HumanSplat, a pioneering generalizable human reconstruction network that derives
3D Gaussian Splatting properties from a single image. This model integrates generative diffusion
and latent reconstruction Transformer models with human structure priors, enhanced by a tailored
semantic-aware hierarchical loss. These innovations achieve high-fidelity reconstruction results in
a feed-forward manner without any optimization or fine-tuning, especially in the important focal
areas such as the face and hands. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses
existing state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, including robust performance in
handling challenging poses and loose clothing. This capability opens up a broad spectrum of potential
applications.

Limitations and Future Works. Our method has some limitations that can be addressed in future
works: (a). While effective with most attire, the model may struggle with intricate garments and
accessories. Future enhancements should incorporate 2D data and innovative training strategies,
which is a promising direction for improving the handling of diverse and unusual clothing styles. (b).
Although already efficient, increasing the computational speed by constraining Gaussian’s number or
combining compact 3DGS with texture representation could further facilitate real-time applications,
particularly on mobile devices. (c). Animating the reconstructed human models currently requires
post-processing. Future work could introduce canonical space to reconstruct animatable avatars
directly, streamlining the process and improving efficiency.

Implementation Details

A.1
Additional Novel View Synthesizer Details

Conditions of Diffusion Model. SVD and SV3D [93, 95] replace CLIP text embeddings [63] with the
image embedding of the conditioning. Compared to text prompts, image prompts provide information
more accurately and directly, and also save time that would otherwise be spent on text inversion or
image caption [21, 102]. SV3D takes an image and the relative camera orbit elevation and azimuth
angles as inputs to generate several corresponding novel-view images, which are continuous in 3D
space and can be regarded as a video with the camera moving. In our work, we finetuned SV3D on
human datasets with relative camera elevation and azimuth angles to generate 4 orthogonal views,
which we found to be sufficient for reconstruction [102].

Transformer Block. The CLIP embeddings obtained from the conditioning image is fed into the
cross-attention layers of each Transformer block, acting as keys and values, while the feature at that
layer serves as the queries. Moreover, the camera trajectory and the diffusion noise timestep are
incorporated into the residual blocks.

Fine-tuning Details. We involves the widely used EDM [118, 119] framework, incorporating a
simplified diffusion loss for finetuning. We fine-tune the novel-view synthesizer at 512-res uses
1000-step warmup with the peak learning rate 1e-4 in the cosine learning rate decay schedule. We
use a per-GPU batch size of 8 objects during 256-res training, and a per-GPU batch size of 4 during
512-res finetuning stage. For each instance, we use 4 input views and 4 novel supervision views at
each iteration of 256-res training and 512-res finetuning.

Triangular CFG Scaling. Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) [120] is a widely used technique to trade
off controllability with diversity. However, this scaling causes the last few frames in our generated
orbits to be over-sharpened. To tackle this issue, we use a triangle wave CFG [93, 121] scaling during
inference: linearly increase CFG from 1 at the front view to 2.5 at the back view, then linearly
decrease it back to 1 .

3D Consistency Evaluation. We also conduct an evaluation of the 3D consistency of our novel-view
synthesizer using the advanced local correspondence matching algorithm, MASt3R [122]. This
approach involves one-to-one image matching between input views and their generated novel views,
with the average number of matching correspondences serving as our metric. Our synthesizer exhibits
a notable improvement in 3D consistency for human novel-view generation after fine-tuning with
human datasets. Specifically, the original SV3D achieves an average of 723.25 matching points,
while our novel-view synthesizer increases this number to 930.13. In comparison, the ground truth
demonstrates a matching point number of 1106.33. This evaluation highlights that fine-tuning on
human datasets significantly enhances multi-view consistency metrics.

A.2
Additional Latent Reconstruction Transformer Details

Network Architecture. The network architecture of the proposed latent reconstruction Transformer
is shown in Fig. 8. The framework is composed of a latent encoder with intra- and inter-attention and
a Gaussian parameter prediction module. It takes initial multi-view latent embeddings as input and
performs projection-aware attention to aggregate human geometric information. From each output
token, we decode the attributes of pixel-aligned Gaussians in the corresponding patch with a Conv
1 × 1 layer.

Hierarchical Loss. Our approach is efficient and can be utilized online without pre-computation. We
calculate the visible face triangles given the mesh and camera parameters. Then each visible triangular
face is assigned the corresponding semantic label [103]. Additionally, it provides labels with superior
3D consistency and avoids issues associated with training instability. First, the hierarchical loss
is specifically focused on the head and hands, excluding hair and clothing, which can be further
supervised using reconstruction loss LRec. Second, instead of using segmentation to reconstruct
and then concatenate different components, we design our loss function based on part segmentation.
Thank to this design, HumanSplat is tolerant of inaccuracies in segmentation.

More Results

For practical applications demanding high input view reconstruction quality, which could potentially
be directly derived from the input image. We improve the weights of the reconstruction loss for input
views (referred to as reweighting loss), demonstrating that the current model with reweighting loss
exhibits sufficient capacity to render input views with higher fidelity, as illustrated in Fig.9. We also
conduct an ablation experiment for the reweighting loss function on the 2K2K Dataset [109]. There
are slight declines in quantitative metrics, specifically, HumanSplat with reweighting loss achieves
a numerical change of -0.141, -0.015, and +0.006 in PNSR, SSIM, and LPIPS. This suggests that
reweighting loss is not “a bag of freebies” and HumanSplat without reweighting loss strikes a balance
between the quality of novel views and the input views.

As for novel view and novel pose rendering, more results are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. For a
single input image, we use Open-AnimateAnyone [123] for novel pose synthesis and HumanSplat
for novel view synthesis. This functionality enables dynamic timestamps and real-time rendering
of novel views, thereby enhancing immersive virtual exploration. Please also kindly refer to our
supplementary video for more results.

C
Broader Impacts

While our model demonstrates the capability to reconstruct photo-realistic 3D avatars, it also in-
troduces potential risks such as privacy violations. To mitigate these concerns, it is imperative to
establish robust ethical guidelines and legal frameworks. This necessitates a collaborative effort
among researchers, developers, and policymakers to promote the responsible use of this technology
and safeguard against its potential misuse.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

24


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Code will be available at: https://humansplat.github.io.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Sec. 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, are properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

27


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects..
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
