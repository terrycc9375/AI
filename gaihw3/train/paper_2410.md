Abstract

In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-
language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional
quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by
minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quan-
tization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary,
we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization
errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal
quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the
strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency
concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the
proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs
between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual
encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition
of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quan-
tization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses
the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA
model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.1

Introduction

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) [31, 53] have achieved outstanding performance in a large
number of multi-modal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering [45, 28], embodied
instruction following [1] and robot navigation [2, 16], which are benefited from numerous network
parameters and vast training data. Despite of the high accuracy and generalization ability across
different tasks, the extreme computational cost hinders the deployment on resource-limited mobile
devices in wide realistic deployment scenarios. Moreover, LVLMs sequentially generate the response
with multiple forward passes, which further increases the computation burden to accomplish the task.
Therefore, it is highly demanded to reduce the model complexity of LVLMs in practical deployment.

To reduce the model complexity, model compression techniques have been presented to accelerate
computation and save the storage space including pruning [18, 51], quantization [19, 13, 23], low-rank
decomposition [26, 20] and efficient architecture design [38, 17]. Among these methods, quantization
replaces the float numbers with quantized ones and substitutes multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations
with integer arithmetic for significant efficiency enhancement. Due to the intractability of the training
data and the unbearable training cost of LVLMs, post-training quantization [33, 36, 48] is leveraged

to reduce bitwidths of weights and activations, which only searches rounding functions with a
small calibration set with frozen network parameters. Searching rounding functions that minimize
model prediction errors causes extremely high search cost due to the large space, and conventional
methods [12, 29] sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing the activation
discretization errors. However, ignoring cross-layer dependency of discretization errors fails to
acquire the optimal rounding strategy and degrades the performance significantly.

In this paper, we present an accurate post-training quantization framework called Q-VLM to accelerate
large vision-language models for efficient multi-modal reasoning. Different from existing methods
which sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions, we mine the cross-layer dependency of
output discretization errors across layers, and employ the dependency to efficiently search the optimal
rounding functions that minimize the quantization noise of the entire model. More specifically,
we observe the significant correlation between the activation entropy and the discretization error
dependency with the following layers. We then employ the entropy as the proxy to decompose the
large search space from the entire model to smaller blocks containing multiple layers, and rounding
functions are searched with the goal of minimizing the block-wise discretization errors. Therefore,
the quantized model remains competitive performance with original full-precision counterparts with
trivial additional search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer
dependency for fine-grained search space decomposition, so that precise rounding functions can
be acquired with further reduced search cost. Our Q-VLM can still generate plausible response
in multi-modal reasoning with 4-bit quantization because of the precise rounding functions, and
compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase the generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA
model. We evaluate our method with the LLaVA and the MoE-LLaVA models in different bitwidth
settings, and the results in various visual question answering datasets demonstrate that our Q-VLM
outperforms the state-of-the-art post-training methods significantly with negligible search overhead.

2.1
Large Vision-language Model

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance because of the fast
adaptation on different downstream tasks with high generalization ability, which benefits from large-
scale image-text pairs [39, 21] and strong generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) [4, 40]. The instruction-following ability and multi-modal representations extracted
by LVLMs are general across tasks, which are usually applied in a wide variety of multi-modal
reasoning tasks such as visual question answering [45, 28], embodied instruction following [1]
and robot navigation [2, 16]. Early attempts introduced rich commonsense in LLMs to vision-
language representation learning, which effectively exploits LLMs by treating visual inputs as
conditional information. In particular, BLIP [25, 24] leveraged data filtering techniques to enhance
performance in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. While
these models exhibited extraordinary vision-language reasoning capabilities, their zero-shot abilities
were limited due to the absence of explicit instruction during training. Recent studies including
LLaVA [31] and InstructBLIP [30] aim to enhance LVLMs’ zero-shot capabilities by aligning them
more closely with human preferences. They finetuned LVLMs with visual instruction samples where
the models were required to complete the human instruction according to the visual information.
Despite the notable performance gains from the large model sizes, the computational complexity
and the storage cost prohibit LVLMs from being deployed in resource-limited devices for realistic
deployment. Lightweight LVLMs such as TinyGPT-V[49] and TinyLLaVA [53] endeavors explore
the extensive domain of large multimodal models focusing on leveraging small-scale models and
achieve efficient LVLMs architecture designs. MoE-LLaVA [28] constructs a spare MoE-based
model, which identifies a sparse pathway by simultaneously handling image and text features to
achieve comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. However, the model inference cost
still exceeds the resource budget of mobile devices or robots because of the low compression ratio.

ods [6, 32] need to finetune network weights with the full training set for rounding, which is less
practical since the data and resources for training may not be accessible for most users. Recently,
post-training quantization (PTQ) [11, 33, 44, 10, 42, 41] has aroused extensive interest, which lever-
ages a small calibration set to search for the optimal threshold in rounding functions with significantly
reduced data demand and optimization cost. Choukroun et al. [7] minimized the l2 distance between
quantized and full-precision tensors to mitigate evident task performance degradation, while Zhao et
al. [52] duplicated channels with outliers and halved their values to reduce clipping loss without
amplifying rounding errors. Liu et al. [33] preserved relative ranking orders of self-attention in
vision transformers to mitigate information loss during post-training quantization and explored a
mixed-precision quantization strategy based on the nuclear norm of attention maps and features.
Zero-shot PTQ further extends the boundaries for efficiently quantizing neural networks without real
image data. Cai et al. [5] optimized pixel values of generated images to align sample batch statistics
with those of batch normalization (BN) layers in full-precision networks. Li et al. [27] extended the
PTQ framework to transformer architectures by diversifying self-attention across different patches
using patch similarity metrics. Meanwhile, deploying PTQ to large language models (LLMs) dynam-
ically search the optimal rounding function for each input sample instead of applying a learnable
one, because the activation distributes very significantly across different samples in large models.
LLM.int8() [8], SmoothQuant [46] and ZeroQuant [48] handled activation outliers to achieve accurate
quantization function learning by eliminating the extreme values with equivalent transformation,
yet encountered challenges in effectively scaling to extremely large models due to the unbearable
computational costs. Furthermore, GPTQ [12], AWQ [29], and QLoRA [9] deployed low-precision
quantization on weight quantization to further reduce the computational complexity. However, these
methods employ layer-wise searching strategy to search the rounding functions sequentially, which
deviates from the optimal ones due to the lack of cross-block dependency.

Approach

In this section, we first introduce the preliminaries of post-training quantization for LVLMs and then
detail the cross-layer dependency mining for LVLM quantization. Finally, we demonstrate the visual
encoder optimization to minimize the quantization errors with negligible search cost overhead.

3.1
Post-training Quantization for LVLMs

Network quantization decreases the bitwidth of weights and activations to save computation memory
and accelerate inference speed. Conventional quantization-aware training (QAT) optimize all parame-

ters in original full-precision networks for optimal quantization, which is unpractical because of the
unacceptable training cost and inaccessibility of the large training datasets. Post-training quantization
(PTQ) leverages a small calibration set X to search the optimal threshold in minor rounding functions
with frozen network parameters, which significantly reduces data requirements and optimization
costs. Specifically, the optimal solution for quantization function learning is acquired by minimizing
the distribution discrepancy between quantized outputs and full-precision ones of the entire model.
The optimization objective J can be formulated as follows:

min
{Qk}
J =
W (n)
q
X(n)
q
−W (n)
r
X(n)
r

s.t.
X(k+1)
q
= Qk(W (k)
q
X(k)

)
(1)

where W (k)
q
and X(k)
q
mean the quantized weights and activations for the kth layer, and W (k)
r
and
X(k)
r
represent their full-precision counterparts. Qk means the rounding function for the kth layer
and n is the total number of the layers in the LVLM. Directly searching the optimal rounding function
is NP-hard because the search space increases exponentially with the layer number. Therefore,
conventional PTQ methods sequentially search the rounding functions by minimizing the quantization
errors for each layer in the greedy way:

min
Qk
J =
W (k)
q
X(k)
q
−W (k)
r
X(k)
r

2

2
(2)

where the layer index gradually increases to search the rounding function from bottom to top layers.
However, the greedy search ignores the cross-layer dependency of discretization errors, which leads
to accumulated discretization errors of model output even for the rounding function with small errors
in the bottom layers.

3.2
Mining Cross-layer Dependency for LVLM Quantization

Directly search the solution to (1) causes unacceptable search cost, while sequentially search the
layer-wise quantization functions results in suboptimal solution. Therefore, we partition the entire
model into different blocks consisting of multiple layers. Searching the optimal rounding function by
considering the output quantization errors for each block achieves better trade-off between the search
cost and the quantization accuracy, which is formulated as follows:

min
{Qk}∈Bi
J =
W (Li)

Figure 2: The correlation between dis-
cretization error difference (DED) and the
activation entropy in 15th layer.

where Bi represents the ith block in our partition and Li
is the index of the last layer in block Bi. Our goal is to
obtain the optimal block partition for rounding function
search, where we expect the dependency for layers in
each block to be strong. Therefore, we can search the
rounding functions for layers in each block by minimiz-
ing the discretization errors for the block output, and the
output errors of the entire model are still minimized.

Explicitly evaluating the cross-layer dependency requires
multiple forward pass of LVLMs for given input, where
the correlation for discretization errors is calculated from
data statistics. To avoid extremely high cost, we have to
explore an efficient proxy to approximate the cross-layer
dependency. We leverage Information Entropy of the
activation to judge the sensitive layers with homogeneous
distribution[43]. For sensitive layers, the noise in the
former layer caused by the deviation from the global
optimal value usually leads to higher deviation for the
current layer, so that jointly search these layers decrease the block output quantization errors. As a
result, discretization error difference (DED) between layer-wise search and joint search is obvious

---Page Break---
for sensitive layers with high entropy. In order to reduce the deviation from the optimal rounding
points, we should search the quantization function by joint consideration of the current layer and the
former one with strong dependency.

Meanwhile, we also empirically verified our assumption shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 is produced
with the activations in the 15th layer of the LLaVA architectures on SQA dataset. The horizontal
axis demonstrates the entropy of the activations, and the vertical axis depicts the discretization error
difference (DED) between layer-wise search and joint search. Different markers mean different input
multimodal samples, where DED and the activation entropy are strongly correlated. Therefore, the
cross-layer dependency D(k, k + 1) between the current layer k and the following layer k + 1 can
be defined as follows:

D(k, k + 1) = −
X

ij
p(x(k)
q,ij, x(k+1)
q,ij
)logp(x(k+1)
q,ij
|x(k)
q,ij)
(4)

where χk represents the set of possible values about the quantized activation xk
q and xk+1
q
in the
kth and k + 1th layer, and p means the probability of the variable. Qk is searched with different
quantization levels for rounding function optimization. We leverage uniform quantization to round the
full-precision tensors due to the high compatibility with real hardware. In realistic implementation,
each element is quantized to the nearest rounding point deterministically. In order to acquire the
entropy of the quantized tensor, we approximate the deterministic quantization process with the
following distribution:

p(x(k)
q,ij) =
exp(−(x(k)
r,ij −qm)2/∆)
PM
m=1 exp(−(x(k)
r,ij −qm)2/∆)
· δ(x(k)
q,ij −qm)
(5)

where ∆is the interval between two consecutive rounding points, and δ represents the pulse dis-
tribution. qm means the mth rounding point in the quantization out of M quantization levels. The
cross-layer dependency of two consecutive layers can be depicted by the discretization error differ-
ence (DED) between the rounding function searched sequentially and jointly, and larger difference
indicates the former layer has significant influence on the discretization errors of the following one.
Figure 2 demonstrates the positively correlation between DED and the activation entropy across
different input samples with high correlation coefficients. Higher conditional entropy indicates that
the activation distribution is homogenized with accumulated quantization errors, which represents
larger cross-layer dependency for obvious influence with the following layers. To evaluate cross-layer
dependency D(kr, ks) of non-consecutive layer kr and layer ks, we consider the summation of
entropy in all intermediate layers between them:

D(kr, ks) = −

ks
X

k=kr

X

ij
p(x(k)
q,ij, x(k+1)
q,ij
)log(x(k+1)
q,ij
|x(k)
q,ij)
(6)

Since searching rounding functions within blocks with large number of layers, we constrain the
maximum layer numbers for each block. We partition blocks in the LVLM based on the acquired
cross-layer dependency:

Bi = {

ks
[

k=kr
Qk|D(kr, ks) > (ks −kr)h0}
(7)

If the average cross-layer dependency between two layers is larger than the threshold h0, all in-
termediate layers are assigned into a single block for joint rounding function search because the
discretization errors of the block output are sensitive to all former layers within a block. Finally, we
search the optimal rounding function by minimizing the output discretization errors of each block,
where we select the optimal percentile p [6] of the full-precision tensor distribution as the bounds for
the uniform quantization.

3.3
Optimizing Visual Encoders for LVLM Quantization

LVLMs leverage a visual encoder to extract informative representations for image input, and align
visual embedding and text embedding with a projection layer. As the visual encoder significantly

5


---Page Break---
modifies the distribution of the activations in LVLMs, the rounding function in visual encoder can be
optimized to minimize the activation entropy to enhance the searching efficiency. As a result, there
are fewer layers in each block for rounding function search and the search cost remains low.

Simultaneously minimizing the activation entropy and weakening the cross-layer dependency for all
layers causes optimization difficulties, because the large number of layers in LLaMA usually provide
conflicted supervision for the visual encoder. Since different layers usually have various influence on
the quantization errors of the output from the entire model, we assign different importance weights
for the entropy minimization objective across layers which are acquired from the Jacobian:

Lent =

n
X

k=1
||∂E(n)

∂X(k)
r
|| ·
X

ij
p(x(k)
q,ij, x(k+1)
q,ij
)logp(x(k+1)
q,ij
|x(k)
q,ij)
(8)

where E(n) represents the quantization errors of the final layer in the model. The Jacobian indicates
the influence of the current layer to the quantization errors of the final output [34]. Larger Jacobian
magnitudes represent the higher influence on the overall discretization errors, and assigning larger
weights to those layers can reduce the cross-layer dependency with fast model convergence. Mean-
while, our objective also includes the minimization of discretization errors for both the output of the
visual encoder and the LVLM, which can enhance the quantization accuracy for visual representation
learning and multi-model reasoning:

Lerr = ||Xv
q −Xv
r || + η||X(n)
q
−X(n)
r
||
(9)

where Xv
q and Xv
r respectively represent the quantized and full-precision output of the visual encoder,
and η is a hyperparameter to balance the importance between the discretization errors of the visual
encoder and the LVLM. Finally, the overall objective for visual encoder optimization can be written
as follows with the hyperparameters λ1 and λ2:

L = Lreg + λ1Lent + λ2Lerr
(10)

where Lreg means the auto-regressive loss adopted in training original LVLM to minimize the
discrepancy of predicted and target tokens. By optimizing the the visual encoder, we can search the
rounding function in more fine-grained blocks with fewer layers to reduce the search cost, while the
quantization accuracy still remains high due to the weak cross-layer dependency.

Experiments

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments for LLaVA and MoE-LLaVA benchmarks on
ScienceQA multi-modal question answering dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods.
We first introduce the implementation details of our method. We then conduct ablation studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of cross-layer dependency mining and visual encoder optimization. Finally,
we compare our Q-VLM with the state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods to show its
superiority.

4.1
Implementation Details

We utilize the large vision-language frameworks for post-training quantization including LLaVA [31]
and MoE-LLaVA [28] with their pre-trained weights for multi-modal question answering tasks. We set
the bitwidth of quantized weight and activation to 6 and 4 to evaluate our method in different quality-
efficiency trade-offs uniform quantization scheme where the interval between adjacent rounding
points was equal. We followed the initialization of the quantization function parameters in QLoRA [9]
for the baseline methods and our Q-VLM, where we minimized the lp distance [37, 29] between the
full-precision and quantized activations to optimize the value range for clipping. We set the maximum
layer depth to 3 within a block to achieve satisfying trade-offs between the discretization errors and
the search cost. In the LVLM quantization exploration, we adjust hyperparameters p of percentile
ranging from 1.0 to 0.98 with 0.005 interval for cross-layer dependency mining. Meanwhile, we
modified the hyperparameter η to demonstrate the effect of the discretization loss which optimizes
the visual encoder in 9. For the parameter learning in LVLM quantization, we randomly select 64
vision-language pairs from the datasets for hyper-network learning where the batchsize was assigned
with 8 for calibration set construction. The quantization function parameters were updated for 10

multi-modal question answering. The multi-modal answer reasoning dataset is ScienceQA [35],
which contains 21k vision-language multiple choice questions. We also contain VizWiz [15] and
VQA-v2 [14] datasets.

4.2
Ablation Study

Since previous layer-wise searching methods ignore cross-layer dependency, we employ joint search-
ing strategy with dependency mining. In order to investigate the influence of the block-wise searching
strategy, we vary the maximum number of layer depths contained in a single block with different
trade-off between discretization errors and searching cost. Meanwhile, we adjust the searching
space of percentile by modifying the hyperparameter p and η for cross-layer dependency mining and
visual encoder optimizing to select the optimal clipping range in quantization function. Finally, we
randomly select 64 vision-language pairs from ScienceQA dataset to finetune quantized models and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cross-layer dependency mining and visual encoder
optimizing method. All experiments in the ablation study were conducted with ScienceQA dataset
and the LLaVA-v1.3-7B framework.

Performance w.r.t. the maximum layer depth within a block: Integrating multiple layers with
cross-layer dependency into a single block can exert considerable influence on the clipping and
rounding errors throughout the entire model, albeit at the expense of exponentially escalating search
costs. Figure 5a illustrates the answering accuracy for our method that astrict different maximum
joint layers, where the performance enhancement for layer depth exceeds 3 is slight with significantly
increased complexity overhead. To ensure efficient quantization of LVLMs with sizable accuracy
increase, we assign the maximum layer depth within a block to 3 in subsequent experiments.

Performance w.r.t. different method we proposed in question answering process: To verify the
effectiveness of different method we proposed in LVLM quantization, we conduct the ablation study
on ScienceQA dataset under different bitwidth. Table 4 illustrates the memory usage in inference,
searching cost in calibration, and answering accuracy for our method under different bitwidth for
LLaVA-v1.3-7B model. Observing the second rows, the cross-layer dependency mining(CDM)
module is important for the final performance, because mining the cross-layer dependency and

baseline for W4A4 quantization, reducing quantization errors and providing more reasonable answers.
We color the text to show the correct or wrong responses.

leveraging block-wise optimization strengthen the cooperation between layers and minimize the
overall quantization errors. Visual encoder optimization (VEO) without cross-layer dependency also
significantly modifies the distribution of the activations in LVLMs for discretization function learning.
Q-VLM disentangles the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained search space decomposition, so
that precise rounding functions can be acquired with further reduced search cost.

Performance w.r.t. hyperparameters p and η: The hyperparameters p control the search space for
cross-layer dependency mining and η balances the importance between the discretization errors of the
visual encoder and the LVLM. Larger p leads to reduced rounding errors by diminishing the influence
of outliers, although excessively large values result in excessive clipping of significant information
in data distribution. Figure 5b depicts the answering accuracy for different hyperparameter settings,
where the medium value for both parameters achieves the highest performance and achieves the
trade-off between quantization errors and searching space.

Visualization reasoning examples: We further provide qualitative visual reasoning example of
the LLaVA-v1.3-13B model in Figure 4 from ScienceQA dataset. Q-VLM improves the responses
compared to AWQ baseline for W4A4 quantization setting, leading to more reasonable and particular
answers for vision-language question pairs. In this first example, Q-VLM correctly answers the
question about the highlighted ocean, while AWQ appears to have limited comprehension of the
image information. For the second example, AWQ under W4A4 lost substantial information to
produce sound reasoning about whether Fromia monilis cells make their own food, while Q-VLM
answered correctly and even produced a table for precise classification about the six broad organisms
called kingdom. Q-VLM improves the visual reasoning ability of LVLMs by reducing factual errors
in the responses.

Comparison with the State-of-the-art Methods

In this section, we compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art post-training quantization
frameworks. As far as we know, we are the first to complete multi-modal LVLMs under W4A4
setting, so we conduct a series of baseline methods by combining the conventional state-of-the-art
post-training quantization methods for fair comparison. For weight quantization, we follow the
experiment setting of AWQ [29] and QLoRA [9]. Meanwhile, as the activations in language modal
exhibit significant variations in value range across different channels, we reproduce RPTQ [50] with
per-channel activation quantization. As the activation distribution appears larger variance across
different tokens in vision modal, we utilize per-token quantization following Outlier Suppression [44].
The answering accuracy of the baseline methods is acquired by implementing the officially released
code and pre-trained model.

Table 2 shows the comparison of top-1 accuracy of different post-training quantization methods across
various LVLMs architectures including LLaVA-v1.3-7B, LLaVA-v1.3-13B [31] and MoE-LLaVA-
1.6B [28], where bitwidths of weights for quantized layers select from 4 and 6. AWQ searched the
optimal scale to protect the salient weight channels and decreased the quantization errors for weight
quantization, while weight-only quantization scaling significantly increased outlier in activation and
led to significant quantization loss. QLoRA with RPTQ employs sequentially search the layer-wise
rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors. However, ignoring cross-layer
dependency of discretization errors fails to acquire the optimal rounding strategy and degrades the
performance significantly. On the contrary, our Q-VLM mines the cross-layer dependency of output
distribution across layers and decomposes the large search space from the entire model to blocks
containing multiple layers, which minimizes the block-wise discretization errors to avoid suboptimal
quantization, and further optimizes the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency
for fine-grained search space decomposition. As a result, our method outperforms QLoRA by 2.26
(79.79 vs. 77.53) for answering accuracy in ScienceQA dataset under 4-bit in LLaVA-7B model.
The computational cost remains the same for baseline methods and our Q-VLM due to the stored
rounding parameters. The advantage of our method becomes more obvious for 4-bit LVLMs because
quantization errors and cross-layer dependency are more important for networks with low capacity.

Table 4: Comparisons with the state-of-the-arts post-training quantization methods for LLaVA-v1.3-
13B models about inference time, memory and accuracy in Science QA dataset.

We also evaluate our method on other datasets with different architectures to verify the generalization
ability. Table 3 demonstrates the accuracy of different post-training quantization methods of LVLMs
on the VQA dataset. Our method achieves the highest accuracy on different datasets, which means
that our method can be robustly deployed in diverse downstream tasks. Table 4 depicts the efficiency
and accuracy of different methods. Both AWQ and our method can reduce the search time and the
inference memory compared with the original full-precision LVLMs, while our method can further
reduce the memory because of the additional quantization of the CLIP. When deploying the quantized
LVLMs on mobile devices, our method is more practical due to the limited memory footprint.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a novel post-training quantization framework of large vision-language
models for efficient multi-modal reasoning. Different from conventional methods which sequentially
search the layer-wise rounding functions without considering cooperation between layers, we mine
the cross-layer dependency and decompose the large search space from the entire model to blocks
containing multiple layers. The proxy of entropy prompts the efficient and optimal block partition for
rounding function search with the goal of minimizing the block-wise discretization errors. Therefore,
the quantized model remains competitive performance with original full-precision counterparts while
the search cost is low. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer
dependency for fine-grained search space decomposition, so that precise rounding functions can
be acquired with further reduced search cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods
highly compress the large vision-language models without performance degradation and achieve
higher answer reasoning ability than the state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods across
large vision-language models with various architectures even under W4A4.

Limitations: One limitation of our work is that applying our framework to the setting of extremely
low bitwidths degrade the performance very significantly, which is also a common issue in post-
training quantization of foundation models. As foundation models are much larger than the resource
limit of mobile devices, we will design efficient post-training quantization method to deploy the
LVLMs on embedded equipment such as cellphones and wearable devices.

models in ScienceQA dataset across bitwidth setting.

A
Why leveraging entropy as proxy:

The benefit and motivation for using entropy rather than quantization errors as a proxy for block-wise
searches lie in several key considerations. We analyze that larger entropy indicates more homogeneous
data distribution, which is a well-established principle in information theory. Consequently, DED
and activation entropy are strongly correlated with an value of 0.97. However, greater quantization
error does not necessarily imply more homogeneous data distribution and does not show a positive
correlation with DED, having an value of 0.81, which is empirically verified in the figure 5.

Meanwhile, the search cost of quantization errors doubles compared with entropy as a proxy, as the
calculation of quantization errors requires multiple forward passes for both the FP model and the
quantized model. The weak correlation and the unbearable search cost render quantization error
unsuitable as a metric for measuring cross-layer dependency.

Furthermore, we conducted experiments comparing the proxy effectiveness of quantization error and
entropy across different models under various bitwidths in Table 5. Entropy outperformed quantization
errors by a significant margin (78.66 vs. 77.97), showing a strong cross-layer dependency within each
block. This allowed us to achieve optimal block partitioning by mining the cross-layer dependency.

B
Performance on more baseline methods

We have extended our experiments to an additional baseline method ZeroQuant-V2[47] and compared
it against our proposed methods in Table 6. ZeroQuant-V2 leverages per-token quantization with
different rounding functions to minimizing activation discretization errors. However, ignoring
cross-layer dependency of discretization errors fails to acquire the optimal rounding strategy with
severe outliers under low bitwidth and degrades the performance significantly. On the contrary,
our Q-VLM mines the cross-layer dependency of output distribution across layers, minimizing the
block-wise discretization errors to avoid suboptimal quantization. We further optimize the visual
encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained search space decomposition. As a

result, our method outperforms ZeroQuant-V2 by 1.71 (79.79 vs. 78.08) in answering accuracy on
ScienceQA dataset under 4-bit in LLaVA-7B model. Additionally, our method enhances inference
speed, exceeding ZeroQuant-V2 by 1.2h (6.1h vs. 7.3h) due to utilizing stored rounding parameters
instead of dynamic per-token quantization. The additional baseline provides a more comprehensive
evaluation framework to highlight the strengths of our approach.

C
Performance on other multi-modal architectures

We also explored the multi-modal architecture OpenFlamingo[3] to ensure the robustness and
generalizability of our methods 7. We deploy our method on OpenFlamingo 3B model using
Vizwiz and Hateful Memes[22] datasets, selecting bitwidths of 4 and 8 for quantized layers. Q-
VLM designed in LLaVA-like architectures can be effectively adapted to cross-attention based
VLMs due to the consistent core mechanism of cross-attention and the robust multimodal alignment
capabilities pre-trained on large-scale vision-language pairs. Since OpenFlamingo is a cross-attention
based VLM, exploiting cross-layer dependency is particularly suitable. Our method outperforms
Q-LoRA by 1.22 (37.60 vs. 36.38) under 8-bit in OpenFlamingo-3B model. The advantage of our
method becomes more obvious for 4-bit 3B LVLMs because quantization errors and cross-layer
dependency play a more significant role in networks with low capacity. These results underscore
the robustness and generalizability of our approach across different tasks, model architectures and
datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We claimed it in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We claimed the limitation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

16


---Page Break---
Justification: We have the theory assumptions and proofs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The experiments can be reproduced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: We will release code as soon as the article is accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We claimed the experimental details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not get the experiment statistical significance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

18


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We use the RTX 3090 which do not provide in the article.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have read the code of ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have broader impacts.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

19


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not use safeguards.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have claimed the licenses for existing assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have this experiment.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have this.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
