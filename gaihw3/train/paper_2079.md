Abstract

This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply
diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image. Due to the
absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo
ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Addi-
tionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face,
but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via
latent diffusion models. Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm,
SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of
imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup
styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and
selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel
Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection
condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the do-
main gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Introduction

Recently, makeup transfer has become a popular application in social media and the virtual world.
With its significant economic potential in e-commerce and entertainment, this technique is attracting
widespread attention from the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. Given a pair
of source and reference face images, makeup transfer involves simultaneously focusing on the realism
of the transferred result, the content preservation of the source image, and the makeup fidelity of the
reference image. Although previous approaches [21, 3, 11, 4, 17, 24, 7, 29, 27, 16, 26, 41, 36, 47, 46]
have made significant advances in image realism and content preservation , the challenge of achieving
high-fidelity transfer of various makeup styles still remains unsolved.

The difficulties of makeup transfer mainly stem from two aspects. On the one hand, makeup transfer
is essentially an unsupervised task, which means that there are no real transferred images that can be
used as labeled targets for model training. To address this issue, previous methods typically synthesize
a "pseudo" ground truth from each input source-reference image pair, as an alternative supervision

signal. However, as shown in Figure 1(a), current pseudo-paired data synthesis techniques, including
histogram matching [21, 29] and geometric distortion [11, 41, 36], fail to produce desirable outcomes.
The reason is that histogram-matching-based methods often ignore the spatial properties of makeup
styles, thus generating over-smoothed targets that lose most makeup details. And since the warping
process in geometric-distortion-based methods relies solely on the shape information (e.g., facial
landmarks) of input images, their pseudo targets usually contain undesired artifacts. Consequently,
these sub-optimal pseudo-paired data will inevitably misguide the model training. This eventually
results in the fact that most existing methods [21, 17, 24, 7, 41, 36, 47] generally exhibit low makeup
fidelity, especially for those images with complex makeup details.

On the other hand, the diversity of different makeup styles can also lead to ambiguity in preserving
source contents. In practice, makeup styles can range from natural, barely-there looks to elaborate
and dramatic ones, each having a different impact on the person face. As shown in Figure 1(b), the
content details of a source face (e.g., freckles and eyelashes) usually should be preserved in a simple
makeup style, while they may be obscured in some complex ones due to the heavy use of cosmetics.
An ideal model should be flexible enough to preserve or discard those source content details according
to user preferences. However, all the previous approaches overlook this requirement.

To address the aforementioned dilemmas, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup
Transfer (SHMT) method, which is built on the recent latent diffusion models [31]. For the first
problem, considering the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, we develop a self-supervised
learning strategy following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm. Specifically, given a face
image, SHMT first extracts its content and makeup representations, and then simulates the makeup
transfer procedure by reconstructing the original input from these decoupled information. In SHMT,
the content representation of a face image includes its 3D shape and texture details, while the
associated makeup representation is captured by destroying the content information from the input
image through using random spatial transformations. In this way, SHMT works in a self-supervised
manner, thus eliminating the misguidance of pseudo-paired data. To address the second issue, we

---Page Break---
introduce a Laplacian pyramid [2] to hierarchically decompose the texture information in input image,
allowing SHMT to flexibly control the preservation or discard of these content details for various
makeup styles, as illustrated in Figure 2. Additionally, we propose an Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA)
module in conjunction with the stepwise denoising property of diffusion models. In each denoising
step, IDA utilizes the intermediate result to dynamically adjust the injection condition, which will
help to correct the alignment errors caused by the domain gaps between the content and makeup
representations. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We propose a novel makeup transfer method, named SHMT, which employs a self-supervised
learning strategy for model training, thus getting rid of the misleading pseudo-pairing data
adopted by previous methods.

• A Laplacian pyramid is introduced to hierarchically characterize the texture information,
enabling SHMT to flexibly process these content details for various makeup styles.

• A new Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module is proposed, which dynamically adjusts the
injection condition in each denoising step, such that the alignment errors caused by the
domain gaps between the content and makeup representations can be corrected.

• Extensive qualitative and quantitative results indicate that SHMT outperforms other state-
of-the-art makeup transfer methods. And additionally, the ablation studies demonstrate the
robustness and the generalization ability of our SHMT method.

Makeup Transfer

Over the past decade, makeup transfer [38, 12, 19] has gained increasing attention in the field of
computer vision. BeautyGAN [21] designs a histogram matching loss and a dual input/output GAN
[10] to simultaneously perform makeup transfer and removal. PairedCycleGAN [3] trains additional
style discriminators to measure the local makeup similarity between the results and reference images.
BeautyGlow [4] decomposes the latent vectors of face images derived from the Glow [18] framework
into makeup and nonmakeup latent vectors. To address misaligned head poses and facial expressions,
PSGAN [17, 24] utilizes an attention mechanism [40] to adaptively deform the makeup feature maps
based on source images, while SCGAN [7] encodes component-wise makeup regions into spatially-
invariant style codes. RamGAN [45] and SpMT [54] explore local attention to eliminate potential
associations between different makeup components. Considering that histogram matching discards
the spatial properties of the makeup styles, FAT [41] and SSAT [36, 37] design a pseudo-paired data
synthesis based on geometric distortion. EleGANt [47] proposes a more effective pseudo-paired data
by assigning varying weights to above two synthesis methods for performance improvement. For
complex makeup styles, LAND [11] leverages multiple overlapping local makeup style discriminators
to focus on the high-frequency makeup details. Additionally, CPM [29] applies a segmentation model
to predict the mask of the makeup pattern. This segmented pattern is then pasted into semantically
identical locations using UV [8] space.

Due to the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, most of the above methods synthesize pseudo-
paired data to guide model training. In this strategy, the quality of these pseudo-paired data is critical,
leading many works [3, 41, 36, 29, 47] to strive for better synthesis techniques. With the help of
the unprecedented generative capabilities of both GPT-4V and Stable Diffusion, a concurrent work
Stable-Makeup [52] produces higher quality pseudo-paired data, thereby improving the performance
of makeup transfer. Unlike these methods, our approach works in a self-supervised manner and
eliminates the need for cumbersome pseudo-paired data synthesis.

2.2
Diffusion Models

Diffusion models generate realistic images through an iterative inverse denoising process. Recently, as
competitors to generative adversarial networks [10], diffusion models have shown significant progress
in numerous generative tasks, including Text-to-Image (T2I) generation [30, 33, 31], controllable
editing [28, 51, 48], and subject-driven [9, 32, 5] or human-centric [22, 44, 43] synthesis. DDPM
[15] proves the feasibility of recovering realistic images from random Gaussian noise. DDIM [35]
enables fast and deterministic inference by transforming the sampling process into a non-Markovian

process. To reduce computational complexity while retaining high quality and flexibility, Latent
Diffusion Models (LDM) [31] apply diffusion model training in the latent space of powerful pretrained
autoencoders. With training on large datasets, both Imagen [33] and Stable Diffusio [31] elevate T2I
synthesis to an unprecedented level.

Inspired by the above approach, we delve into the makeup transfer task based on diffusion models.
Compared to previous GAN-based makeup transfer methods, our approach eliminates the need for
adversarial training and tedious loss function design, while delivering enhanced performance.

Our Methodology

3.1
Preliminary

Our method is developed from Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) [31], which performs the diffusion
process in the latent space to reduce the computational complexity of the model. In particular,
LDM comprises three key components: an image encoder E, a decoder D, and an UNet denoiser ϵθ.
Firstly, the encoder E compresses an image I from the pixel space to a low-dimensional latent space
z0 = E(I), while the decoder D efforts to reconstruct the original image I from the latent variable z0
(e.g. D(z0) = x0 ≈I). Then, a UNet denoiser ϵθ is trained to predict the applied noise in the latent
space. The optimization process can be defined as the following formulation:

Lldm = Ezt,c,ϵ∼N(0,1),t∼U(1,T )[∥ϵθ(zt, c, t) −ϵ ∥2],
(1)

where zt is the noisy latent variable at the timestep t, c is the conditioned signal, ϵ is randomly
sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution, and T is the defined maximum timestep.

During inference, zT is sampled from a random Gaussian distribution. The UNet denoiser ϵθ then
iteratively predicts the noise in the latent space at each timestep t and restores z0 via a sampling
process (e.g. DDPM [15] or DDIM[35]). Finally, z0 is reconstructed by the decoder D to obtain the
generated image. See [31] for more details.

Overview

The goal of makeup transfer is to generate a new facial image that preserves the content information
(e.g., background, facial structure, pose, expression) of a source image while applying the makeup
style of a reference image. To achieve this, we propose SHMT, with its framework outlined in Figure

---Page Break---
3. In SHMT, we craft a self-supervised strategy for model training in Section 3.3 and design an
Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module to correct alignment errors in Section 3.4. The training and
inference process of SHMT is presented in Section 3.5.

3.3
Self-supervised Strategy

Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, we craft a self-supervised strategy for
makeup transfer. The main idea is to separate content and makeup representations from a facial
image, and then reconstruct the original image from these components.

Foreground and background segmentation. Makeup transfer is a localized modification task
confined to the facial area. As such, a pre-trained face parsing model [49] is used to segment the
foreground and background areas from the original image I. In makeup transfer, the background area
Ibg (which includes hair and clothes) is a known component. Hence, the background area Ibg is input
to the latent diffusion model along with the noisy image It. The goal of the model is to inpaint the
unknown facial area, using subsequent content and makeup representations as conditions.

Makeup Representation. In our approach, the makeup representation is derived by destroying
the image’s content information. Specifically, we apply a sequence of spatial transformations to
the foreground image Ifg. These transformations include random cropping, rotation, and elastic
distortion to create variation. As illustrated in Figure 3, the distorted foreground image Im, while
losing the majority of the content information, retains the makeup information well. In addition, these
transformations effectively mimic semantic misalignment scenarios and facilitate the robustness of
the model to poses and expressions [17, 7].

Content Representation. Inspired by physical face modeling [12, 19, 20], the content representation
of a face is simplified into two main components: face shape and texture details.

Face Shape: The face shape, which determines the facial structure, head pose, and expression, is a
crucial component to preserve during makeup transfer. In this context, a typical 3D face reconstruction
model, known as 3DDFA-V2 [13], is employed to extract the face shape I3d from the original image
I. To match the resolution of the latent space of LDM, we perform a pixel unshuffle operation [34] to
downsample I3d.

Texture Details: Texture details are incorporated to complement the excessively smooth face shape.
Considering the ambiguity of texture detail preservation, the Laplace pyramid [2] is introduced to
build hierarchical texture details. To prevent color disturbances, the foreground image Ifg is first
converted to a grayscale image ˆIfg of h × w pixels. Then we downsample it by applying a fixed
Gaussian kernel to produce a low-pass prediction l1 ∈R
h
2 × w

2 . The high-frequency component h0,
which is treated as texture details, can be calculated as h0 = ˆIfg −ˆl1, where ˆl1 is upsampled from l1.
By replacing ˆIfg with l1 and repeating these operations, we obtain a series of hierarchical texture
details [h0, h1, · · · , hL], where L refers to the decomposition level of the Laplace pyramid. These
texture details, whose resolution gradually halves and ranges from fine to coarse, are illustrated in
Figure 3. If the resolution of the texture details exceeds that of the latent space, we downsample it
using a pixel unshuffle operation [34]. Otherwise, the bilinear interpolation is used for upsampling.

Note that only one texture detail hi is concatenated to the face shape I3d as a complete content
representation. When hi is a fine texture detail, our model only needs to distill the low-frequency
makeup information from the makeup representation to reconstruct the image. This is suitable for
simple makeup styles. When hi is a coarse texture detail, our model must also distill the high-
frequency makeup information from the makeup representation to ensure the recovery of the image.
This is suitable for complex makeup styles.

3.4
Iterative Dual Alignment

To reconstruct the original image, spatial attention [40] is utilized to semantically align distorted
makeup representation with content representation. At each timestep, we constructs a pixel-wise
correlation matrix M by calculating the cosine similarity as:

M(i, j) =
fc(i)T fm(j)
∥fc(i)∥2∥fm(j)∥2
,
(2)

5


---Page Break---
where fc = Ec(I3d, hi), fm = Em(E(Im)) denote the semantic features extracted by encoders Ec
and Em. f(i) represents the feature vector of the i-th pixel in f and M(i, j) indicates the element at
the (i, j)-th location of M. We consider the correlation matrix M as a deformation mapping function,
and use it to spatially deform the feature maps zm = E(Im) of makeup representations:

z
′
m =
X

j
Softmax(M(i, j)/τ) · zm,
(3)

where Softmax(·) denotes a softmax computation along the column dimension, which normalizes
the element values in each row of M, and τ > 0 is a temperature parameter. Theoretically, the
deformed feature maps z
′
m is semantically aligned with the content representation. However, due to
the domain gap between content and makeup representations, we find that alignment errors occur
frequently in z
′
m. Considering the property that noisy intermediate result It is gradually moving
closer to the real image domain (e.g., the makeup representation domain), we propose a Iterative
Dual Alignment (IDA) module to address the above issue. At each timestep, it calculates an extra
alignment prediction z
′′
m between the noisy intermediate result ˆIt and makeup representation Im
to dynamically correct the previous alignment prediction z
′
m. ˆIt is the result of It removing the
background area. Since the noise degree of ˆIt is determined by timestep t, a MLP module predicts
the percentage w of two alignment predictions from timestep t:

ˆzm = (1 −w)z
′
m + wz
′′
m,
(4)

where w = MLP(t) and the MLP module consists of two fully connected layers and ends with
a Sigmoid activation layer. Finally, the mixed prediction ˆzm is concatenated with the content
representation and injected into the denoiser’s encoder through a projection module consisting of
1 × 1 convolution. In addition to correct alignment errors, IDA has two other advantages. First,
because ˆzm is semantically aligned with the content representation, IDA can control the makeup
style in a spatially-aware manner. Corresponding results are displayed in the supplementary material.
Second, IDA is relatively lightweight, with only approximately 11M parameters.

3.5
Training and Inference

During training, the parameters of the pre-trained autoencoder are fixed, the U-net denoiser ϵθ and
IDA module are jointly optimized from scratch under the original objective function in Equation 1.
At inference, the model receives the background area Ibg and content representation (I3d and hi)
from the source image, as well as the undeformed makeup representation Im from the reference
image, to generate the makeup transfer result.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental settings

Datasets. Following [21, 17], we randomly select 90% of the images from the MT dataset [21] as
training samples and the rest as test samples. In addition, Wild-MT [17] and LADN [11] datasets
are also used to validate the performance and generalization capability of our model. The images in
the Wild-MT dataset contain large pose and expression variations, and the LADN dataset collects a
number of images with complex makeup styles.

Implementation Details. In our experiments, we discover that the autoencoder with a downsampling
factor of 4 preserves texture details better than the one with a factor of 8. Therefore, the autoencoder
with a downsampling factor of 4 is selected, and the SHMT model is trained at a resolution of 256 ×
256. The specific structure of the UNet denoiser ϵθ remains the same as the LDM [31], with IDA
module replacing the original conditional injection module. In Equation 3, τ is set to 100. We train
the model with Adam optimizer, learning rate of 1e-6 and batch size of 16 on a single A100 GPU.
Our model is trained for 250, 000 steps in about 5 days. For sampling, we utilize 50 steps of the
DDIM sampler [35].

Evaluation Metrics. In order to comprehensively and objectively compare the different methods,
we choose three evaluation metrics, FID, CLS and Key-sim. Following [24], FID [14] is calculated
between reference images and transferred results to indicate image realism. The lower the FID, the

better. Recently, the work [39] proves that the CLS token and the self-similarity of keys (abbreviated
as Key-sim) in DINO’s [50] feature space can represent the appearance and structure of an image,
respectively. Inspired by this, we compute the cosine similarity of the CLS token between reference
images and transferred results to represent the makeup fidelity, and the cosine similarity of Key-sim
between source images and transferred results to reflect the content preservation. The higher the CLS
and Key-sim, the better.

Baselines. We choose seven state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods as baselines, including PSAGN
[17], SCGAN [7], EleGANt [47], SSAT [36], LADN [11], CPM[29] and Stable-Makeup[52]. Among
them, only Stable-Makeup is a diffusion-model-based method, while the others are GAN-based
methods. And LADN, CPM and Stable-Makeup focus on complex makeup styles. In our experiments,
the baseline results are derived from official publicly available code or pre-trained models.

4.2
Comparisons

Qualitative Results. The qualitative comparison with different GAN-based methods for simple
and complex makeup styles are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. Although PSGAN,
SCGAN, EleGANt, and SSAT preserve the content of the source image well, they have low fidelity for
reference makeup, especially in complex makeup styles. In addition, they have a tendency to modify

the background color, e.g., the second and fourth rows of Figure 5. LADN’s results are accompanied
by a large number of artifacts and content distortions. CPM performs relatively satisfactorily in
complex makeup, but still fails to reproduce some high-frequency makeup details. Due to the UV
space not including the forehead area, the CPM has a noticeable sense of pasting, and there are some
artifacts along the facial contour. The results of diffusion-model-based methods are shown in Figure
6 and Figure 7. For simple makeup styles, the results of Stable-Makeup show a noticeable color shift
when compared to the reference makeup styles. In addition, these results tend to alter the content
information of the source image, including identity and expression. For complex makeup styles, the
results of Stable-Makeup still show a significant loss of high-frequency makeup details. In contrast,
our SHMT method can naturally and accurately reproduce various makeup styles on the source face
by equipping it with different texture details.

Quantitative Results. In our experiments, we randomly selected 1000 source-reference image pairs
from the test set of each dataset to calculate each evaluation metric. The quantitative results of the
different methods are listed in Table 1. SHMT-h0 equipped with fine texture details h0 obtains the
highest value on Key-sim, indicating better content preservation. SHMT-h4 equipped with coarse
texture details h4 achieves the highest values on FID, CLS, suggesting greater image realism and
makeup fidelity. This also demonstrates that there is a tradeoff between content preservation and
makeup fidelity in the makeup transfer task.

User Study. We also perform a user study to evaluate the performance of different models. We
randomly select 50 pairs of images with different types of makeup styles and generate the transferred

considering image realism, content preservation, and makeup fidelity. To ensure a fair comparison,
the transferred results are displayed simultaneously in a random order. The results of the user study
are shown in Table 2.

4.3
Ablation Study

The effectiveness of hierarchical texture details. Figure 8 (a) illustrates the visual comparison of
SHMT with varying texture details in handling both simple and complex makeup styles. SHMT-h0
tends to preserve high-frequency details of the source image, such as subtle expressions, single
and double eyelids, eyelashes, and freckles. It is more suitable for simple makeup transfer. On the
other hand, SHMT-h4 is more likely to transfer the high-frequency details from the reference image,
making it more appropriate for complex makeup transfer. By staggering the timestep and employing
a different model to predict the noise, i.e., using SHMT-h0 for [T,t] and SHMT-h4 for (t,0), we can
easily achieve a seamless interpolation between the two results.

The effectiveness of IDA. To verify the effectiveness of IDA, we remove the additional alignment
prediction z
′′
m and replace ˆzm with z
′
m as an injection condition for the denoiser. We retrain the
SHMT-h4 model, and the alignment visualizations and transfrred results are shown in Figure 8 (b).
As seen, the proposed IDA module effectively corrects alignment errors and enhances makeup fidelity.
The quantitative results are displayed in Table 3. In Figure 8 (c), the trend of percentage w over time
is investigated. As timestep t becomes smaller, the domain gap between the noisy intermediate result
ˆIt and makeup representation Im gets smaller, and w increases indicating that the model favors more
the alignment prediction of these two. In addition, w of SHMT-h4 is significantly higher than that of
SHMT-h0 at each timestep t, which we attribute to the fact that transfering high-frequency texture
details requires more precision in semantic alignment.

Robustness and Generalization. Further, as shown in Figure 9 (a), calculating the semantic
alignment between the source and reference images makes our model insensitive to age, gender,
pose and expression variations. To evaluate the generalization ability, we collect some sketch and
anime examples which have a significant domain gap with the training samples and have never been
encountered by the model before. The results are displayed in Figure 9 (b).

Limitations

The limitations of our method can be summarized in two aspects. First, our proposed model relies on
the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models (face parsing and 3D reconstruction), and the stability
of our model suffers when their output is inaccurate. More results and discussion are provided in the
supplementary material. Second, compared to previous GAN-based approaches, our model has more
parameters and requires more computational resources during inference, taking several seconds to
generate an image. Recent accelerated sampling techniques [25, 53, 23] may be able to alleviate this
limitation to some extent.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method. It
employs a self-supervised strategy for model training, freeing itself from the misguidance of pseudo-
paired data employed by previous methods. Benefiting from hierarchical texture details, SHMT can
flexibly control the preservation or discarding of texture details, making it adaptable to various makeup
styles. In addition, the proposed IDA module is capable of effectively correcting alignment errors
and thus enhancing makeup fidelity. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our SHMT method.

Appendix

A
The Effectiveness of Hierarchical Texture Details

As the texture details go from fine to coarse, the high-frequency information of the original image provided in
the content representation decreases. In order to reconstruct the original image, our model SHMT has to learn
more high-frequency details from the makeup representation, thus adapting to more complex makeup styles. To
verify this, we train the SHMT model equipped with different texture details separately, and the corresponding
results are shown in Figure 10. From h0 to h4, our model gradually shifts from preserving the texture details of
the source image to transferring the texture details of the reference image, such as the skeleton makeup style
in the third row. The quantitative results of the corresponding models on the LADN dataset are displayed in
Table 4. As the metric CLS gradually increases, the metric Key-sim gradually decreases, which also indicates a
trade-off between makeup fidelity and content preservation.

Comparison with InstantStyle

We also compare the proposed method with the recent style transfer method InstantStyle [42]. The qualitative
results are shown in Figure 11. In InstantStyle [42], we fix the text prompt to "a woman, best quality, high
quality", the number of samples is set to 4, and other parameter configurations follow the default settings. As
seen, InstantStyle [42] captures the color and brushstroke style of the global image, not the makeup style of the
face. Additionally, it does not effectively preserve the content information of the source image, indicating that
the generalized style transfer method may not be suitable for the specific makeup transfer task.

C
Makeup Style Control

C.1
Global Makeup Interpolation

In our proposed method, the makeup information is decoupled from the input images and encoded into the
feature maps ˆzm. This allows us to interpolate the makeup styles between two different reference faces by
linearly fusing their the feature maps ˆzm, as follows:

ˆzm = (1 −β)ˆzm1 + βˆzm2.
(5)

Here ˆzm1 and ˆzm2 are alignment predictions of two different reference images, respectively. By adjusting the
value of β from 0 to 1, SHMT can generate a series of transferred results. Their makeup styles will gradually
change from that of one reference image y1 to that of the other y2. Moreover, by assigning the source image as
y1, we can control the degree of makeup transfer for a single reference input y2. The global makeup interpolation
results are shown in Figure 12.

C.2
Local Makeup Interpolation

In SHMT, the alignment prediction ˆzm is deformed through the spatial attention, so that it can be semantically
aligned with the source image. Such spatial alignment enables SHMT to implement the makeup interpolation
within different local facial areas, which can be formulated as follows:

ˆzm = ((1 −β)ˆzm1 + βˆzm2) ⊗Maskarea + ˆzm_self ⊗(1 −Maskarea),
(6)

where ⊗denotes the Hadamard product and ˆzm_self denotes the alignment prediction by assigning the source
image as a reference image. Maskarea is a binary mask of the source image x, indicating the local areas to
be makeup, which can be obtained by face parsing. Figure 13 visualizes the local makeup interpolation results
within the areas around the lips and eyes, respectively, i.e., area ∈lip, eye for Maskarea. Similarly, we can
also control the local makeup transfer degree of a single reference image by replacing the other reference input
with the source image.

C.3
Preserving Skin Tone

Similar to previous approaches [17, 36, 47, 7, 46, 11, 46, 52], SHMT assumes that the foundations and other
cosmetics have already covered the original skin tone. Therefore, the skin color of the reference face is considered
as a part of its makeup styles and is faithfully transferred to the final generated result, which may corrupt the
skin tone of the source image. To alleviate this problem, we can perform the above-mentioned local makeup

interpolation operation in the face region of the source image to preserve its skin tone. This procedure can be
formulated as:

ˆzm = ((1 −β)ˆzm_self + βˆzm2) ⊗Maskface + ˆzm_self ⊗(1 −Maskface).
(7)

Here, the transferred result realizes the local makeup interpolation between the source image x and the reference
image y2 within the face area (excluding the lip and eye areas) in x, which is indicated by the mask Maskface.
The interpolation results are visualized in Figure 14. When β = 0, the transferred result will not change the skin
tone of the source image. And when β = 1, Equation (7) degenerates to the standard makeup transfer process
in SHMT, which will distill the makeup information (including the skin tone) from the reference image to the
source image.

C.4
More Comparison Results

Figure 15 and Figure 16 show more qualitative comparisons between SHMT and state-of-the-art methods on
simple and complex makeup styles, respectively.

D
Limitations

Our proposed model relies on the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models (face parsing and 3D reconstruction),
and the stability of our model suffers when their output is inaccurate. As shown in Figure 17, the face parsing
model often marks high-frequency makeup styles in the forehead area as hair and segments them into the
background area, resulting in performance degradation.

Social Impact

E.1
Social Impacts

Facial makeup customization offers an entertaining tool for generating realistic character photos. However, the
long-term usage of makeup transfer techniques may increase users’ appearance anxiety. And such technology
may require access to personal biometric information, such as facial features, which could raise concerns about
facial privacy if misused.

E.2
Safeguards

We will utilize the following strategies to mitigate negative impacts:

1) We will encrypt or anonymize facial images during transmission and storage, such as using hash values instead
of real image data.

2) We will use the Stable diffusion safety checker 3 to conduct security checks on our generated images, so that
we can identify and handle Not Safe For Work (NSFW) contents in images.

3) Since our method is working on human faces, we will also employ some deep-fake detection models [1, 6] to
filter the results generated by our model.

4) We will ask the users to agree to a license or conform a code of ethics before accessing our model, which
requires them to use our model in a more standardized manner.

E.3
Responsibility to Face Images

The face images in this study are taken from publicly accessible datasets, they’re considered less sensitive.
Furthermore, our data algorithm is strictly for academic purposes, not commercial use. During the inference
stage, the proposed model adjusts only the makeup style without altering the individual’s identity, thereby
minimizing potential facial privacy concerns.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the abstract and introduction, we provide a detailed comparison of the differences
with existing approaches, accurately reflecting the contribution and scope of the paper. Please refer to
Abstract and Section 1 for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the Limitations section, we discuss the limitations of our approach and provide explicit
examples in the supplementary material. Please refer to Section 4.4 and supplementary material for
details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper. Please refer to Section 3.4, and Section 4.1 for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The release of the code is subject to the company’s permission, and we will do our best
to release the code and trained models as soon as possible.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper details all the training and testing details needed to understand the results (e.g.,
data segmentation, hyperparameters, parameter selection methods, optimizer types, etc.). Please refer
to Section 3.5, and Section 4.1 for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Following the previous approaches, we randomly selects 1000 pairs of test samples and
reports only the average metrics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources needed to reproduce
the experiments. Please refer to Section 4.1 for details.

24


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the
work performed in supplementary material. Please refer to Section 6 in supplementary material for
details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

25


---Page Break---
Justification: In supplementary material, we describe safeguards that have been put in place for
responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse. Please refer to supplementary
material for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creator or original owner of the assets used in the paper (e.g., code, data, models)
has been appropriately credited, and the licenses and terms of use have been explicitly mentioned and
appropriately respected. Please refer to Section 4.1 in the main text and Section 6 in supplementary
material for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

26


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
