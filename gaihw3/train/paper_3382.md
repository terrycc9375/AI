Figure 1: Personalized segmentation task involves segmenting a specific reference object in a new
scene. Our method is capable to accurately identify the specific reference instance in the target image,
even when other objects from the same class are present. While other methods capture visually or
semantically similar objects, our method can successfully extract the identical instance, by using
a new personalized feature map and fusing semantic and appearance cues. Red and green indicate
incorrect and correct segmentations respectively.

Abstract

Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a
dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance.
While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for
training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to
these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a sig-
nificant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance
when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore
text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel
approach called PDM for Personalized Diffusion Features Matching, that lever-
ages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization
tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance
on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even super-

vised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and
segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.

Introduction

Personalized retrieval and segmentation focus on identifying specific instances within a dataset. When
provided with an input image featuring a particular instance (such as your beloved cat) and a brief
description ("A cat"), the objective is to locate and segment this exact instance throughout a large
collection of images. Personalized methods are useful in various applications, including instance
search [34], product identification [6,41], and landmark recognition [47]. Furthermore, personalized
segmentation can be applied to video tracking [45], automatic labeling [43], and image editing [5,8].

While supervised methods can be effective for these tasks, they require an extensive amount of labeled
training data. Recently, a self-supervised foundation model was proposed [45] to address this task.
This model uses the SAM encoder [14] or DINOv2 [23] foundation model to extract spatial features
from a given reference instance. These features are then used to localize the object instance in the
target image. While effective when a single instance appear in the target image, both DINOv2 and
SAM fall short when multiple instances within the same object class are presented in the image. This
is illustrated in Figure 1 showing failure cases of DinoV2 and SAM in localizing the correct dog
or van (see first and second row). They also fail when two similar objects from different semantic
classes are presented (wrongly segmenting the dog instead of the cat.)

In this paper, we propose to explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Text-to-image
foundation models have achieved remarkable success in generating new and unique images from
text prompts [7,30,31,33]. These models have the capability to generate an infinite array of objects
and instances, each exhibiting unique appearances and structures. Consequently, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that properties of generated objects are encoded within the intermediate features of the
diffusion model during generation. Recent studies [1,37,40] show zero-shot capabilities to create
subtle changes in generated instances by manipulating the intermediate activation of the diffusion
layers, during generation. Although effective, using text-to-image diffusion models "out of the box"
for instance-related tasks, beyond generation or editing, remains unexplored.

In this paper, we present a new approach, called PDM, Personalized Diffusion Features Matching,
for personalized retrieval and segmentation. PDM requires no training or fine-tuning, no prompt
optimization, or any additional models. We demonstrate how a specific layer and block contain hidden
textural and semantic information. These features are then used for the localization of a reference
instance within a given target image, enabling both personalized segmentation and retrieval. PDM
builds upon these newly discovered diffusion features, and surpasses other self-supervised methods
(like DINOv2 [23], SAM [14] and DIFT [36]) weakly supervised methods (CLIP, OpenCLIP) and
even supervised methods on personalized instance retrieval and segmentation tasks.

We also address significant limitations in traditional benchmarks for retrieval and segmentation.
Current benchmarks often feature images with a single, distinct object or multiple objects from
different categories, allowing semantic-based methods to achieve high accuracy. To overcome
these deficiencies, we construct new benchmarks based on a newly published video tracking and
segmentation dataset [4]. This dataset includes videos with multiple instances from the same category
(e.g. two dogs playing or a group of people talking). Our method significantly outperforms all
baselines on this new dataset, highlighting its ability to accurately handle multiple similar instances
and demonstrating its superior capability in personalized retrieval and segmentation.

Related Work

Exploring pre-trained diffusion features. Text-to-image diffusion models [7, 30, 31, 33] have
demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for image generation tasks. With its superior generation
ability, recent studies started investigating the internal representation of diffusion models. DIFT [36]
and Fuse [44] showed that extracting features from the ResNet layers of the denoising module
provides a semantic correspondence between two objects which can also be used for image editing
propagation. Plug-and-Play [40] suggested to extract features from self-attention layers of a reference
image, during the image generation process, while incorporated with a text prompt. This approach

showcased that output images can retain the structure of the reference image while embodying
the appearance described in the text prompt. Cross-Image-Attention [1] further showed that sub-
layers in self-attention layers correspond to the structure and the appearance of generated images.
Their findings enabled the generation of images that blend the structure from one image with the
appearance from another. ConsiStory [37] recently suggested injecting the self-attention features
of an instance from a pre-generated image into the generation process of other images to ensure
consistent reproduction of the same instance across images. DiffSeg [38] introduced a method using
self-attention maps for zero-shot image segmentation. They aggregate attention maps from multiple
self-attention layers during image generation and merge them iteratively to produce a stack of object
proposals. Segmentation maps are then obtained by applying Non-Maximum Suppression over
the merged maps. In contrast to these studies, in this paper, we explore using internal features of
pre-trained diffusion models for instance related tasks.

Personalized Segmentation: PerSAM [45] introduced the use of SAM [45] for personalized image
segmentation. They employed the SAM [14] encoder (or DINOv2 [23]) for the representation of
the reference and target images, which are then used to calculate a confidence map localizing the
user’s reference instance in the target image. Finally, it predicts positive and negative points on the
target image to be used as prompts for SAM. Additionally, they proposed a new benchmark, called
PerSeg, for personalized image segmentation. It includes 40 objects across various categories, each
associated with 5-7 images, and is evaluated using mIoU and bIoU metrics.

Instance Retrieval: Content-based instance retrieval can be seen as a variant of personalized retrieval
where images contain only a single instance. Recent supervised methods, GSS [21] and HP [2]
proposed Graph Networks for effective retrieval. SuperGlobal [34] proposed a memory-efficient
image retrieval method, that specifically focuses on the global feature extraction while in the re-
ranking stage, they update the global features of the query and top-ranked images by only considering
feature refinement with a small set of images, thus being very efficient. Recently, also self-supervised
models [9,11,23,46] show comparable performance to supervised methods on retrieval tasks. These
techniques achieve impressive results in zero-shot scenarios however, they often necessitate model
fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. In this study, we investigate text-to-image diffusion
models, which belong to the category of self-supervised models, for zero-shot personalized retrieval
and segmentation tasks. Our findings show that diffusion features supress features from other
self-supervised foundation models.

Semantic-level Feature Matching. Recent works have focused on improving semantic-level feature
matching in various tasks. SIGMA [19] introduces semantic-complete graph matching for Domain
Adaptive Object Detection, addressing within-class variance through node-to-node matching. Light-
Glue [20] enhances local feature matching efficiency with a deep network adaptive to image difficulty,
making it ideal for latency-sensitive tasks. In this paper, we propose Personalized Diffusion Features
Matching (PDM), which leverages intermediate features from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for personalized retrieval and segmentation without additional training.

Method

In this section, we describe our approach to leverage pre-trained diffusion models for personalized
retrieval and segmentation. We begin by defining these tasks and then delve into identifying features
that encompass both semantic and appearance aspects. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of
these features in personalized instance retrieval and segmentation.

3.1
Personalized Retrieval and Segmentation.

In personalized retrieval and segmentation, the user supplies a single reference image, and a mask
indicating the reference instance [45] or the class name of the instance [10]. This work focuses on
the case where only class names are provided. For personalized retrieval, the goal is to retrieve images
from a database that contains the exact instance specified in the reference image. In personalized
segmentation, the objective is to segment the specified instance in new images and videos.

cat in I2, indicating textural similarity. Additionally, the localization is sharper at larger timesteps.
(b) Visualization of the cross-attention map FSCT for a given prompt "dog". Note the higher region
correlation (brighter colors) corresponding to the dog, while overlooking the cat in the bottom image.

3.2
Are instance features even encoded in a pre-trained text-to-image model?

Pre-trained text-to-image models can generate an endless variety of objects and instances, each
with unique visual characteristics and structures. Recent methods have demonstrated that specific
changes in the activations of self and cross-attention activations of the diffusion layer can influence
the appearance of specific instances in the generated image. These methods typically modify all
activations across all denoising timestamps to affect the generated image. This indicates that instance
features are indeed encoded within these models. One can propose to use all diffusion activations
during generation and aggregate them for downstream tasks. However, using all features extracted
from diffusion layers is memory-intensive and computationally demanding. It also raises the challenge
of merging all these features coherently.

We aim to identify a single layer at a unique timestamp where both the semantics and appearance
(texture) of a reference instance are encoded. We first briefly explain how we extract features from
Stable Diffusion [31], a pre-trained text-to-image model. The architecture of Stable Diffusion consists
of a VAE encoder and a VAE decoder that facilitates the conversion between the pixel and latent
spaces, and a denoising U-Net module that operates in the latent space. We refer the reader to
Appendix A, for preliminary on the internal structure of the denoising U-Net layer. We first encode
input image I into the latent space of a VAE using an encoder to produce a latent code z0. Next, we
employ a diffusion inversion method [24,35], to compute the latent code zt at the time step t with the
class name embedding as inputs. We then run denoising step at timestamp t to extract activations
(features) from the denoising U-Net.

Previous studies [36,40,44] observed that outputs of earlier layers from the U-Net decoder capture
coarse yet consistent semantic correspondences, while deeper layers capture more low-level details
and high-frequency information. Based on these observations, and in contrast to previous work, we
conducted a more thorough analysis of features extracted from all blocks of the last U-Net layer,
examining their role across different timestamps. Interestingly, we consistently found that appearance
features are encoded in the queries (QSA) and keys (KSA) matrices of the self-attention (SA) block.
This is illustrated in Figure 2(a), where we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on features
extracted for a pair of images, at various timestamps. It shows that QSA features of the dog in I1
are similar (same color and texture) to those of the middle dog and cat in I2, indicating that textural
features are encoded in these layers (similar results are observed for KSA features).

We therefore define appearance features of an image to be the average tensor of QSA and KSA
features with dimensions h × w × d extracted from the self-attention (SA) block, at the last layer L
of timestamp t:

FA = 1

2(QSA(L)
t
+ KSA(L)
t
) ∈Rh×w×d.
(1)

Here, h and w represent spatial resolutions of features extracted from layer L, while d denotes the
feature dimension.

Figure 3: An overview of our Personalized Diffusion Features Matching approach. PDM combines
semantic and appearance features for zero-shot personalized retrieval and segmentation. We first
extract features from the reference, Ir and target It images. Appearance similarity is determined
by dot product of cropped foreground features from the reference feature map, FAM
r
and the target
feature map FA
t (Eq. 5) . Semantic similarity is calculated as the product between class name token
C and the target semantic feature map FS
t to create a Semantic Map (Eq. 6). The final similarity map
SDF combines both maps by average pooling. Note, that while the appearance and semantic maps
attend on two dogs, their fusion yields a single and correct result.

For semantic similarity, [16] observed that cross-attention maps establish the relationship between
the textual input prompt and patch/pixel-wise image features, effectively allowing a coarse semantic
segmentation map that highlights areas of potential object localization. This is further illustrated in
Figure 2(b), where the cross attention of the word "dog" with both images results in an attention
map highlighting the location where dogs can be found. This cross-attention map is calculated by
fusion of the spatial feature map and the token embedding, after projection. Therefore, we define the
semantic features to be the projected spatial features of the cross-attention (CA) block:

FS = QCA(L)
t
∈Rh×w×d.

3.3
Personalized Diffusion Features Matching

We now describe our method for combining semantic and appearance features to address personalized
retrieval and segmentation tasks in a zero-shot manner, without training or fine-tuning. We call our
approach PDM for Personalized Diffusion Features Matching. See Figure 3 for illustration.

Let FA
r , FS
r and FA
t , FS
t denote the appearance and semantic features extracted for the reference
image Ir and target image It respectively. Next we define our appearance and semantic similarity
functions.

Appearance Similarity: We start by localizing objects in the target image that have similar visual
features as the reference instance in Ir. To this end, we make use of C ∈R1×d as the projected token
vector of the class name, extracted from the cross-attention block CA(L)(same block as FS).

We first use the cross-attention map between spatial image features and C to obtain a reference mask
Mr. Specifically:

Mr = I(softmax(FS
r CT
√

d
) > τ) ∈Rh×w.
(3)

This mask is used to crop relevant appearance features of the instance from the feature map FA
r ,
which will later be used for searching within target images. The masked appearance feature map is
thus defined as:
FAM
r
= Mr ◦FA
r
(4)
I is the indicator function and τ is a threshold, resulting eventually in a binary mask, with n
foreground features (discarding zeroed-out tokens). Note that ◦denotes spatial-wise multiplication.
This approach leverages the U-Net’s ability to preserve spatial information in its latent codes and

between the reference and target image by simply applying a dot product between the corresponding
masked reference feature map and target feature map, followed by average pooling:

Semantic Similarity: Here we would like to localize all objects that have the same semantic category
as the reference instance. To achieve this, we make use of the semantics encoded in the input class
name and calculate a score map between C and FS
t . Specifically, we compute:

SS = FS
t CT
(6)

The overall diffusion feature (DF) score map combining both semantic (conceptual) and appearance
(textural) features is then

SDF = 1

Using diffusion features for personalized retrieval and segmentation. For personalized retrieval,
we rank the target images, using a global score, obtained from the average of SDF , indicating the
matching score between a target (candidate) and the reference (query) image. For personalized
segmentation, we propose two variations: (1) The score map SDF is upsampled to the size of the
target image, using a binary threshold. We then segment all pixels that are above that threshold. (2)
Following [45], we select the point with the highest confidence value in SDF as positive prompt for
the position of the target object, and use it to segment the object with SAM [14].

Evaluation Datasets for Personalized Retrieval and Segmentation

For the evaluation of PDM, we adopted traditional instance retrieval and one-shot segmentation
benchmarks, where we also used the provided class names. While preparing these benchmarks, we
discovered that most existing instance retrieval and one-shot segmentation benchmarks predominantly
showcase only a single instance per object class. For instance, widely used instance retrieval
benchmarks such as RParis [28] and ROxford [28], focus on single landmarks in their images, with
categories typically representing only one possible instance. Similarly, image and video segmentation
benchmarks such as the popular Davis [27] dataset and PerSeg [45] mainly comprise either a single
instance or multiple instances from diverse object classes, each exhibiting distinct visual and semantic
characteristics. This is illustrated in Figure 4. These trends make it relatively straightforward for
semantic-based methods to accurately retrieve or segment instances, as there are often no hard
negative instances (objects from the same category but different instance) within or across images.
Consequently, comparing instance-based features with current methods on such benchmarks often
yields comparable results, failing to highlight the strengths of instance-based methods.

To establish a clear distinction between semantic-based and instance-level methods, we introduce
two new benchmarks: Personalized Multi-Instance Retrieval (PerMIR) and Personalized Multi-
Instance Segmentation (PerMIS). Our proposed benchmarks are constructed using the recently

6


---Page Break---
introduced BURST dataset [4], which serves for Object Recognition, Segmentation, and Tracking in
Video. This dataset contains videos with pixel-precise segmentation masks for all unique object tracks
spanning different object classes. As the dataset encompasses both single-instance and multi-instance
videos, we focus on videos containing at least one hard negative instance per video. Specifically, we
select videos with a minimum of two instances belonging to the same object class. We then filter out
frames that do not contain these instances. This filtering process results in 150 videos across 16 object
classes, with an average of 3.1 instances per frame. Detailed statistics can be found in Appendix C.
Finally, for the personalized instance retrieval (PerMIR), we randomly chose three frames from each
video, designating one as the query frame and the remaining two as the database (gallery) frames.
For the personalized image segmentation task (PerMIS-image) we randomly pick three frames from
every video, assigning one as the query frame and the others for evaluation. Ground-truth masks are
used for cropping the instance from query images and are also used for segmentation evaluation. We
further evaluate on the task of video label propagation. For this task we use the first frame of a video
as the reference image and the subsequent frames for evaluation. We intend to make our generated
datasets publicly available for future work.

Experiments

We evaluate PDM across three main tasks: (1) Personalized image and video segmentation, (2)
Personalized retrieval and (3) Video label propagation where a single video frame is given with
object segmentation and the aim is to propagate labels (masks) across video frames, leveraging the
information provided by previous frames. The ablation study can be found in Appendix B

Implementation details. The main bottleneck of PDM is the real image inversion process, where the
image is converted to its noise latent representation for subsequent feature extraction. Using SoTA
inversion technique by [24] with Vanilla StableDiffusion, takes about 5 seconds for each image on
a single A100. This is due to the requirement of 50 inversion steps. In order to mitigate this, we
integrated [24] into SDXL-turbo, a variant of stable diffusion requiring only 4 inversion steps. This
decreases the inversion time to 0.5 seconds per image. Therefore, for all our experiments, features
were extracted from SDXL-turbo at the last U-Net layer at the first timestep t = 4. Furthermore, all
images were resized to 512 x 512 for proper image inversion. We set τ, the threshold for Mr to be
0.7 for all our experiments.

5.1
Personalized Image Segmentation

Datasets. We conducted experiments across two personalized (one-shot) image segmentation bench-
marks. We first evaluate PDM on the PerSeg [45] dataset, which comprises 40 objects spanning
diverse categories such as daily necessities, animals, and buildings. Each object is represented by
5-7 images and masks, capturing different poses or scenes. Additionally, we assessed our method’s
performance on the PerMIS-Image benchmark (Section 4).

Baselines. We evaluate our method by contrasting it with different self-supervised foundation models:
(1) DINOv2 [23], (2) PerSAM [45], (3) DIFT [36] and DiffSeg [38]. Additionally, we benchmark it
against SoTA-supervised techniques trained specifically for image segmentation, namely SEEM [48]
and SegGPT [42].

Evaluation protocol. Following [23,36], we report mIOU and bIOU metrics over all benchmarks.
Segmentation with PDM is done by upsampling SDF to image size. Segmentation with DINOv2
and DIFT is done using features as a similarity function. Specifically, nearest neighbors are found
between the query features and target gallery features. No training is involved. We additionally report
results with SAM integration, as proposed by [45] (see 3). Here, features are utilized to derive a
positive point, followed by segmentation using SAM.

Results. Table 1a presents the results of our experiments in personalized image segmentation. Our
approach, denoted as ours, outperforms supervised methods trained specifically for image segmen-
tation. Additionally, our method achieves superior performance compared to other self-supervised
models, including DINOv2 [23], DIFT [36], and PerSAM [45]. We also demonstrate a significant im-
provement in performance by applying PerSAM with our method, called PerSAM(PDM), surpassing
both benchmarks by a considerable margin. Figure 5(a) provides qualitative segmentation results
showing that our method reliably identifies the reference instance despite substantial variations in

benchmarks. We conducted evaluations on the DAVIS17 dataset [27]. This dataset comprises 150

performance on the PerMIS-Video benchmark (Section 4).

masks as the user-provided query data. We also follow them and report region-based similarity J (the
Jaccard Index, measuring the overlap between the predicted and ground truth regions), contour-based
accuracy F (evaluating the accuracy of the predicted contour compared to the ground truth contour)
and J &F as evaluation metrics.

5.3
Personalized Retrieval

Datasets. We conduct experiments across various retrieval benchmarks, including both single-
instance and multi-instance datasets. Initially, we assess our model’s performance on the widely-used
ROxford and RParis datasets [25, 26] with revised annotations [28]. These datasets consist of
4,993 and 6,322 images, each featuring a single instance. Evaluation involves 70 query images per
dataset, categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard tasks based on retrieval complexity, with our focus
primarily on the more challenging Medium and Hard tasks. Instance masks are obtained from [3].
We further evaluate our model on the PerMIR benchmark (Section 4).

Baselines. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art models, including self-supervised founda-
tion models: MAE [11], SEER, and DINOv2 [23]; weakly-supervised foundation models: CLIP [29]
and OpenClip [13]; and fully supervised methods: GSS [21], HP [2], and SuperGlobal [34]. Both
self-supervised foundation models and weakly supervised foundation models were evaluated without
further training or fine-tuning. We showcase results utilizing PDM both independently and as a
re-ranking technique built upon various frozen pre-trained models (used for global feature retrieval).
We denote this combination of methods, in Table 2 by the name of the pre-trained model + PDM.
We follow [34] and apply re-ranking on the top 400 global features with the highest scores from the
pre-trained model.

Evaluation Protocol. Following [23, 34], we report the mean average precision (mAP) for all
methods. In all experiments, we used code and parameters provided by the authors of the compared
methods.

Results. Table 2 presents the Mean Average Precision (mAP) across all benchmarks, highlighting the
retrieval performance of PDM. Our method consistently outperforms all self-supervised and weakly
supervised foundation methods and achieves comparable results to supervised methods. Notably,
it surpasses DINOv2 [23] on the ROxford-hard dataset by +4.3% and by +43% on the PerMIR
benchmark. Additionally, using PDM for reranking, we achieve better performance than SoTA-
supervised methods, on the RParis and ROxford benchmarks. The results on the PerMIR benchmark
underscore the inherent challenges faced by current methods in handling multi-instance samples.
In contrast, our method demonstrates the robustness and effectively retrieves the correct samples,
highlighting the efficacy of features derived from pre-trained diffusion models for instance-based
retrieval tasks. Figure 5(b) provides qualitative retrieval results showing that our model successfully
identifies images containing the same instance, while other methods primarily capture semantic
similarity. See Appendix F for additional qualitative results.

Summary and Limitation

In this paper, we introduce a zero-shot approach for utilizing pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD)
features for personalized retrieval and segmentation tasks. We also review existing benchmarks for
these tasks and propose a new benchmark to better evaluate performance. Our method showcases
SoTA performance in three different personalization tasks. Nevertheless, it requires image inversion
for feature extraction and therefore may depend on the success of image reconstruction quality.

Appendix

A
Perliminaries

Fig. S 1: Single block of a U-Net layer (
Stable Diffusion [31]).

Denoising module of text-to-image diffusion model.
We start by describing the different layers that compose
the denoising module of a Text-to-Image diffusion model.
Latent Diffusion Model [31], applies the diffusion pro-
cess in the latent space of a pre-trained image autoencoder.
This model adopts a U-Net [32] architecture conditioned
on the guiding prompt P. The U-Net is composed of sev-
eral layers where each consists of three types of blocks:
(1) a residual block, (2) a self-attention block, and (3) a
cross-attention block as illustrated in Figure 1. At each
timestep of the denoising process, the noised latent code zt
is fed as input to the U-net. The residual block convolves
image features, zt to produce intermediate features ϕ(zt).
In the self-attention block, ϕ(zt) projected into "queries"
Q, "keys" K and "values" V . For each query vector qi,j, representing a patch, located at the spatial
location (i, j) of Q, the self-attention map is then given by:

A(i,j) = softmax(qi,j · KT

√

d
).
(8)

The last block, the cross-attention block, facilitates interaction between the spatial image features
extracted from the self-attention block and the token embeddings of the text prompt P. The process
is similar to that in the self-attention layer, but here, Q is derived from the spatial features of the
previous self-attention layer, while K and V are projected from the token embeddings of the prompt.

B
Ablation Study

In this section, we ablate key components of our method.

Personalized Retrieval.
(1) Object Mask Instead of Class Name: In this scenario, we considered
the case where the class name is not provided, but an object mask is available. We tested this
configuration on PerMIS, resulting in a mIOU of 45.0% compared to the original 42.3% when using
the class name. The bIOU was 89.2% compared to the original 86.8% when using the class name.
This shows that using an object mask leads to improved segmentation performance, indicating its
potential as a valuable alternative when class names are not available. (2) Appearance vs. Semantic
Maps: We examined the individual contributions of the Appearance and Semantic maps to the final
similarity map. For this experiment, we used each map independently as the final similarity map,
ignoring the other. When using only the Appearance Map, we achieved a mIOU of 30.2%, compared
to 24.9% when using only the Semantic Map. Both results are significantly lower than our original
mIOU of 42.3% when using both maps and averaging them. These findings underscore the necessity
of integrating both maps to achieve optimal performance in the final similarity map, and eventually
in personalized matching. We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We will make sure to add this
ablation study to the final version.

Personalized Segmentation.
(1) Object mask instead of class name: Here we explore our approach
when the input image is not accompanied by a class name but rather by a precise segmentation
mask of the personalized object. During inversion, the prompt is set to be an empty string. The
segmentation mask is used to distinguish the personalized object’s features from the input image
instead of cross attention map. We tested this configuration on PerMIR, resulting in a mAP of 76.2
compared to the original 73.0 when using the class name. This illustrates the strong capabilities of
the semantic map obtained using the cross-attention layer. (2) Appearance vs Semantic maps: Here
we examine the individual contributions of the Appearance and Semantic maps to the final similarity
map SDF calculated in our method. For this experiment, we use each map independently as the final
similarity map SDF , ignoring the other (instead of averaging them, as explained in Section 3, Eq.(7).

C
PerMIR and PerMIS Statistics

In this section, we describe the statistics of our newly introduced benchmark, Personalized Multi-
Instance Retrieval (PerMIR). Following our image extraction process from the BURST dataset
(detailed in Section 4), each video results in three different images of the personalized object, with
each image containing an average of 3.1 different objects. We randomly select one image to serve as
the query, while the other two are labeled as positive instances in the gallery. This process yields
a total of 150 queries and a gallery comprising 450 images. The object distribution among the 150
query images is as follows: 51 persons, 52 cars, 10 animals, 4 food items, and 33 other objects (e.g.
cup, drawer, tennis racket, slippers).

Random frame selection was done once during dataset preparation to ensure fair comparisons among
all methods. We manually inspected the frames for quality and diversity, finding them acceptable and
adequate given the BURST [2] dataset’s quality and video length. In response to this comment, we
further quantified frames quality and diversity. Using the CLIP model, we found an average cosine
similarity of 0.17 between frames, indicating low similarity (compared to 0.31 for adjacent frames)
and thus high diversity. For quality, the mean SSIM between dataset frames and a random ImageNet
subset was 13.2 (compared to 11.8 for ImageNet samples, higher values indicate better quality).

D
Performance Across Diffusion Models

To evaluate how Personalized Diffusion Model (PDM) performance and quality vary with different
diffusion models, we conducted experiments using three models: SDXL-turbo, SDXL, and SDv2.1.
These experiments were performed on two personalized image segmentation datasets: PerSeg and
PerMIS. For each diffusion model, we report segmentation performance in terms mIoU and bIoU, as
well as the feature extraction run time per image and the mean PSNR of the inversion-reconstruction
process.

Table 1 summarizes the results. It shows that while SDXL and SDv2.1 provide better performance in
both mIoU and bIoU compared to SDXL-turbo, their inversion-reconstruction time is significantly
longer, as these models require more inversion steps. Specifically, the reconstruction time for SDXL
and SDv2.1 is 10 times slower than SDXL-turbo. Nevertheless, these models yield higher PSNR
values, indicating better inversion-reconstruction quality.

As indicated by the results, PDM features can be found for other diffusion models like SDXL and
SDv2.1, which yield better segmentation performance (higher mIoU and bIoU values) and improved
reconstruction quality (higher PSNR) at the cost of longer inversion times. These findings further
confirm the robustness of PDM features across different diffusion models, and we will expand on
these results in the final version of the paper.

This paper focused on UNet-based diffusion models because they are currently the most widely-used
text-to-image models. We are optimistic that similar features can be found in other diffusion models,
for the following reasons. First, recent studies [39] identified structural and appearance features in

vision transformer-based models. Second, it was not hard to find instance-features in several Unet
diffusion models as illustrated above above. Thus, we assume that other diffusion models (such as
DiTs) will also exhibit comparable or better instance features.

E
Combining Appearance and Semantic Features

In the main paper, feature averaging was used to combine appearance and semantic features in order
to avoid training or hyperparameter tuning on labeled data. We conducted a further analysis using a
weighted combination of semantic and appearance features, optimized on a training set to explore
more complex fusion methods.

For this, the PerMIR and ROxford-Hard datasets were split into 20% training and 80% test sets, and
the weighted fusion parameters were optimized on the training sets. The results are summarized in
Table 2. The weighted combination of features led to improvements in performance compared to
simple averaging, with gains of 5.2% on the ROxford-Hard dataset and 5.7% on the PerMIR dataset.

These findings suggest that, when a training set is available, weighted fusion can significantly enhance
performance. This opens up the potential for further exploration of more sophisticated, learnable
fusion methods in future work.

These results highlight the benefits of weighted fusion for combining appearance and semantic
features, and future work will investigate more advanced techniques that dynamically adapt to the
data.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we clearly mention our contributions on both and provide a specific
paragraph for the contributions, while mentioning the generalization capabilities.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we discuss our assumptions and limitations in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: We present and prove the derivation for our NR based inversion.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We mention all the details required to reproduce our results, including models
and hyper-parameters. As we use public datasets/benchmarks, all datasets used are cited.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: Not currently. We use public datasets, so the data used is available. We are
working on a formal approval to publicly release the code, upon acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We mention all the necessary information for testing and follow the previous
benchmarks. We build upon a pre-trained method for our approach.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We follow all previous evaluation protocols for each benchmark.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use standard GPUs

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Image retrieval and segmentation were widely studied before. We are not
aware of any ethical considerations here

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We shortly discuss this issue in our summary

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Our new benchmark proposal is based on an
existing, publicly available dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly available code resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite all the benchmarks and code repositories used.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
