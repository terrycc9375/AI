Abstract

The power of large vision-language models (VLMs) has been demonstrated for
1

diverse vision tasks including multi-label recognition with training-free approach or
2

prompt tuning by measuring the cosine similarity between the text features related
3

to class names and the visual features of images. Prior works usually formed the
4

class-related text features by averaging simple hand-crafted text prompts with class
5

names (e.g., “a photo of {class name}”). However, they may not fully exploit the
6

capability of VLMs considering how humans form the concepts on words using rich
7

contexts with the patterns of co-occurrence with other words. Inspired by that, we
8

propose class concept representation for zero-shot multi-label recognition to better
9

exploit rich contexts in the massive descriptions on images (e.g., captions from MS-
10

COCO) using large VLMs. Then, for better aligning visual features of VLMs to our
11

class concept representation, we propose context-guided visual representation that
12

is in the same linear space as class concept representation. Experimental results
13

on diverse benchmarks show that our proposed methods substantially improved
14

the performance of zero-shot methods like Zero-Shot CLIP and yielded better
15

performance than zero-shot prompt tunings that require additional training like
16

TaI-DPT. In addition, our proposed methods can synergetically work with existing
17

prompt tuning methods, consistently improving the performance of DualCoOp and
18

TaI-DPT in a training-free manner with negligible increase in inference time.

Introduction
20

The goal of multi-label image recognition is to assign all semantic labels (or class names) within an
21

image [10, 44, 48, 11, 27, 33, 31]. Differing from single-label recognition, multi-label recognition
22

addresses a broader range of practical applications such as image retrieval [36, 39], recommendation
23

systems [52, 8], medical diagnosis recognition [43] and retail checkout recognition [17, 45]. However,
24

one of the challenges in multi-label recognition is the difficulty of collecting full label annotations,
25

which is laborious and prone to missing. To alleviate it, recent works have investigated training with
26

incomplete labels such as partial labels [37, 6, 31, 15, 9] or a single positive label [13, 46].
27

Recent advances of large vision-language models (VLMs) [32, 2, 22, 25, 47, 49] has demon-
28

strated their strong transferability on various downstream tasks with great performance. Contrastive
29

Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieved impressive performance in zero-shot classification by
30

measuring the cosine similarity between images and class-related hand-crafted text prompts [32].
31

Fine-tuning VLMs for adapting desired downstream datasets [32] can further improve performance
32

for targeted tasks, but tuning millions of parameters is usually undesirable due to computation burden
33

and possible forgetting. Prompt tuning has been investigated as an efficient and low-cost training
34

paradigm [54, 53], learning only a few context tokens of VLMs for a given task. In multi-label
35

recognition, prompt tuning with CLIP has been investigated for distinguishing multiple objects in an

image [37, 18, 41], mitigating the difficulty of acquiring annotated samples. However, prompt tuning
37

inherently requires labeled data with additional training and may be susceptible to overfitting for
38

context tokens, hindering generalization. The capability of VLMs for label-free and/or training-free
39

classification has been exploited using prompt engineering [32, 34, 50, 4]. However, prompt ensem-
40

bles by averaging text features from simple hand-crafted prompts (e.g.,“a sketch of {class name}”)
41

yielded marginal improvements and struggled with multi-label recognition. Thus, the approach of
42

prior works on zero-shot or prompt-tuning based multi-label recognition using class names to obtain
43

class-related text features from VLMs may not use the full capacity of VLMs properly.
44

Humans form concepts on words from past experience, especially using their patterns of co-occurrence
45

with other words [5, 29, 20]. Inspired by this perspective in cognitive neuroscience, we propose a
46

novel approach of exploiting VLMs for multi-label recognition by replacing single class name-related
47

hand-crafted prompts with our proposed class concept representation using text descriptions such
48

as “A person holding a large pair of scissors,” capturing rich contextual information with target
49

class names (e.g., person) as well as related words (e.g., holding, scissors). Our class concept will
50

be constructed from rich contextual descriptions on classes that may contain diverse and realistic
51

patterns of co-occurrence with target class name and other related class names. Then, this novel text
52

features with class concept representation requires aligned visual features with them for multi-label
53

recognition to properly match them with our class concepts. Thus, we propose context-guided visual
54

features to bring VLM’s visual features to the same representation domain as our class concept
55

representation by using our sequential attention. See Fig. 1 for the differences of performing multi-
56

label recognition using (a) prior zero-shot approach (ZS-CLIP), (b) our proposed class concepts from
57

text descriptions and (c) our proposed context-guided visual features on the same space as the class
58

concepts. We demonstrated that our proposed methods achieved improved performance on multiple
59

benchmark datasets without additional training (tuning), without additional labels (text-image pairs)
60

and with negligible increase in inference time. Here is the summary of the contributions:
61

• Proposing a novel class concept representation for training-free multi-label recognition tasks
62

using VLMs from massive text descriptions inspired by how human forms concept on words.
63

• Proposing a context-guided visual feature, transformed onto the same text feature space as
64

class concepts using sequential attention for better aligning multi-modal features.
65

• Demonstrating that our methods synergetically improve the performance of ZSCLIP and
66

other state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods with a negligible increase in inference time.

language model CLIP has been developed to address the high labeling costs of multi-label images in
72

incomplete label setting. Among them, DualCoOp [37] proposed a novel prompt tuning approach
73

that trains positive and negative learnable contexts with class names in the partially labeled setting.
74

For mitigating data-limited or label-limited issues, TaI-DPT [18] proposed effective dual-grained
75

prompt tuning method using easily accessible text descriptions. It is worth noting that TaI-DPT
76

used the same text descriptions as ours not for performing training-free multi-label recognition
77

itself, but for label-free prompt tuning by replacing the image features with the contextual text
78

features (text as image) under the conventional framework of multi-label recognition with class

name. SCPNet [14] is designed to leverage the structured semantic prior from CLIP to complement
80

deficiency of label supervision for MLR with incomplete labels. CDUL [1] proposed unsupervised
81

multi-label recognition through pseudo-labeling using CLIP, alleviating the annotation burden. Even
82

though recent works has demonstrated outstanding performance of multi-label recognition task, they
83

still require tuning costs or labeled dataset to adapt pre-trained CLIP to various downstream tasks. In
84

this work, our method enables training-free and label-free adaptation of CLIP into downstream tasks,
85

utilizing the text descriptions.
86

Training-free enhancement with CLIP. For single-label recognition, recent works has developed
87

the training-free enhancement of CLIP. ZPE [4] weighted-averaged many prompts by automatically
88

scoring the importance of each prompt in zero-shot manner for improving prompt ensemble technique.
89

CALIP [19] designed a simple parameter-free attention module for zero-shot enhancement over CLIP
90

without any tuning of model parameter. With few-shot samples, Tip-Adapter [51] proposed training-
91

free approach for fast adaptation to target task, obtaining the weights of adapter using few-shot
92

samples during inference. Since these methods were originally developed for single-label recognition,
93

it is difficult to be directly applied to multi-label recognition. In multi-label recognition, our method
94

enables training-free enhancement and demonstrated its effectiveness on the benchmark dataset.

Method
96

First of all, we propose class concept representation as a training-free approach for multi-label
97

recognition instead of class name by exploiting pre-trained VLM and rich contextual text descriptions.
98

Secondly, we also propose context-guided visual feature that can enhance the alignment of the
99

visual feature of VLM with our novel class concept. Our proposed methods are label-free as well as
100

training-free so that they can be applicable synergetically for most existing VLM-based multi-label
101

recognition methods. The overall pipeline of our method is illustrated in Figure 2.

3.1
Class Concept Representation
103

Humans form concepts on words from past experience, often using their patterns of co-occurrence
104

with other words [5, 29, 20]. For example, the word “apple” does not exist alone, but often comes
105

with the verb “eat” or the noun “basket.” However, it may not well associate with other words such
106

as “fly” or “space.” Fortunately, we can easily obtain rich contextual text descriptions from various
107

public sources, including captions from benchmark datasets [26, 23, 24, 30], web crawling and large
108

language models [38, 7, 40, 28]. These text descriptions do not only contain class names, but also
109

include other words like class-related verbs and nouns in real-world contexts.
110

Assume that rich contextual text descriptions were gathered from the public sources that include one
111

or multiple class names. We denote the set of text descriptions as Zall = {z1, z2, ..., zM} where zi
112

refers to an individual text description. M denotes the total number of text descriptions across all
113

classes. Note that M can be dynamically changed at inference since our proposed method does not
114

require additional training, thus can be seen as test-time adaptation. Assuming that the target task
115

uses the class names of person, scissors, clock, building and cake, the examples of the contextual text
116

descriptions from Zall are as follows:
117

“A person holding a large pair of scissors.”
118

“A clock mounted on top of a building in the city.”
119

“Half of a white cake with coconuts on top.”
120

TaI-DPT [18] used these descriptions with rich contextual information as a surrogate for images
121

to propose a label-free prompt tuning. In this work, we propose to use these descriptions to form
122

concepts on class names to compare with images, so that ways of using them are completely different.

Figure 2: (a) Overall pipeline of our method. 1) Class concept representation: VLM’s text features
from the rich contextual descriptions associated with each class name are used to construct the class
concept. 2) Context-guided visual features: VLM’s visual features are sequentially transformed onto
the class concept representation space using (b) sequential attention mechanism.

We define the class concept as a vector in the space constructed by the text descriptions as fol-
124

lows. Firstly, the linear space Z can be constructed by spanning the VLM’s text features from
125

all text descriptions zi in Zall using the VLM’s text encoder Etxt(zi) ∈R1×D, leading to
126

Z = span{Etxt(z1), Etxt(z2), . . . , Etxt(zM)}. Secondly, we propose the class concept for a target
127

class name c as a vector tconcept
c
in the space Z by defining it as follows:
128

tconcept
c
=

M
X

i=1
wc,i1c(zi)Etxt(zi) ∈R1×D
(1)

where 1c(zi) an indicator function such that 1c(zi) = 1 if the text description zi contains the class
129

name c and 1c(zi) = 0 otherwise. The weight wc,i is assigned to the text feature of each text
130

description within a class c and it is assumed to be normalized within the class. In this work, we set
131

wc,i = 1/ PM
j 1c(zj) for ∀i, thus will be the same for all i for each class, which was guided by the
132

prior work on prompt ensembling [4], demonstrated that the prompt ensembling with equal weights
133

achieved significant performance gains that were comparable to weighted ensembling for single-label
134

recognition. Each class concept can be stored individually or together as a matrix.
135

Our class concept representation thus consists of various text features including diverse contextual
136

information related to the target class name. For instance, the descriptions for the class name “dog”
137

should contain the target class name as the following examples of the text descriptions:
138

“A dog greets a sheep that is in a sheep pen.”
139

“A woman walks her dog on a city sidewalk.”
140

“A dog with goggles is in a motorcycle side car.”
141

Note that the descriptions include the target class name (bold) as well as other related words in class-
142

related contexts (underline) as intended. We expect that our novel class concepts will be beneficial for
143

multi-label recognition due to other nouns (other class names) as well as other verbs to better explain
144

the context where the target class name is used. In this work, we obtain the texts from two sources to
145

collect the sufficient contextual text descriptions. The first source is the MS-COCO dataset [26] that is
146

publicly available and the second source is large language model(i.e., GPT-3.5[28]) that can generate
147

the several sentences quickly if the set of class names related to the target task were provided.
148

3.2
Context-Guided Visual Feature
149

Our novel class concept representation forms new vectors for diverse class names in the linear space
150

Z instead of the embedding space of the VLM where the text and image encoders were relatively
151

well-aligned. Thus, it is expected that the class concept representation and the VLM’s visual feature

Figure 3: Softmax values can be used to weigh the relevance with the given image. However, (a) naive
attention mechanisms yielded almost equal softmax values, thus may include texts with low relevance.
The proposed sequential attention method focuses on a subset of texts most relevant to the test image,
thus can transforms visual features to context-guided visual features for multi-label recognition by
assigning very high softmax value to the relevant text at index 0 while very low softmax value to the
irrelevant text at index 5000.

may not be aligned well. Here, we propose context-guided visual feature by transforming the visual
153

features of the VLM onto the same space as the class concept representation Z by using our sequential
154

attention with the text descriptions Zall that were used for class concept construction.
155

For the target image q and the VLM’s visual encoder Eimg(q), the L2-normalized global visual feature
156

f is obtained by using Eimg(q) ∈R1×D and the flatten local visual feature F ∈RHW ×D is also
157

constructed by using Eimg(Pi,j(q)) where Pi,j(·) is an extractor of the (i, j)th patch of the input image.
158

Then, we aim to transform both the global visual feature vector f and the local visual feature matrix F
159

onto the same linear space Z as our class concept representation. One easy way is to “project” these
160

visual features f and F onto the space Z by computing the cosine similarity between visual features
161

(f and the column vectors of F) and all the text features ti = Etxt(zi) ∈R1×D, i = 1, . . . , M
162

that constructed Z. Unfortunately, when the softmax function is applied to the cosine similarity
163

values, they tend to become similar, thus weigh both relevant and irrelevant texts almost equally
164

as illustrated in Figure 3 (a). To address this challenge, we propose sequential attention, applying
165

the softmax function to part of the cosine similarity values by dividing them into G groups. For the
166

text feature matrix T = [t1 t2 · · · tM] ∈RM×D, let us determine Mi for i = 1, . . . , G such that
167

M = ΠG
i=1Mi and reshape the text feature matrix to be T ∈RM1×···×MG×D. Then, propose to
168

sequentially apply the following attention process for G iterations for estimating both global and
169

local context-guided visual features v(k) and V (k), respectively, at the kth iteration:
170

v(k) =

where αf and αF denote the modulation parameters, SoftmaxMk refers to the softmax operation
172

applied along the dimension corresponding to Mk. In this work, we utilize v(3) and V(3) to compute
173

classification score. The sequential attention process is illustrated in Figure 2 (b). Figure 3 further
174

demonstrates that our sequential attention is particularly effective in handling massive text descriptions.
175

Without sequential attention, weighted averaging essentially becomes equal averaging.

Architecture of model. Two encoders of CLIP are denoted as Eimg and Etxt for the visual encoder
178

and text encoder, respectively. Following TaI-DPT [18], we adopt the structure of double-grained
179

prompts (DPT), which has been shown effective for enhancing zero-shot multi-label recognition
180

performance. To obtain visual representations at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels, we

extract the local visual feature map F = Eimg(x) ∈RHW ×D is extracted before attention pooling
182

layer, where H and W are spatial dimension of visual feature. After attention pooling layer, we
183

obtain the global visual feature f ∈R1×D. Similarly, text features t = Etxt(z) ∈R1×Dare obtained
184

by projecting the End-of-Sentence (EOS) token of the text prompt. Thus, we leverage both global
185

and local visual features for multi-label recognition.
186

Inference. Through our sequential attention, we obtain the context-guided visual features v(G) and
187

V (G) at both global and local levels, respectively. The similarity score Sglo and Sloc are calculated
188

between the transformed context-guided visual features v(G), V (G) and the class concepts tconcept
c
189

using the cosine similarity Ψ(·,·) as follows:

where Stot
c
is the classification score for the class c and sloc
c,j = Ψ([V (G)]j, tconcept
c
) for the class c.
191

For obtaining Sloc
c , we employ the spatial aggregation over HW [37].
192

Finally, we combined ZSCLIP[32] and other prompt tuning methods with our training-free approach
193

through simple logit ensemble. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating of
194

our method with existing methods, thereby boosting the performance of multi-label recognition.

MS-COCO [26] consists of 80 classes with 82,081 images for training and 40,504 images for test.
203

VOC2007[16] consists of 20 object classes with 5,011 image for training and 4,952 images for test.

Evaluation on Limited Data Setting
213

To evaluate our method, we conducted the experiments in limited data scenarios, including zero-shot
214

and few-shot settings for data-limited cases and partially labeled setting for label-limited cases. Note
215

that only our method provides training-free enhancement of CLIP without tuining cost for multi-label
216

recognition. Therefore, our method can be easily combined with existing methods to improve their
217

performance.
218

Evaluation on Zero-Shot Setting. We performed comparison studies for different zero-shot and fully
219

supervised methods in multi-label image recognition. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method
220

which, we combined our method with existing zero-shot methods, ZSCLIP[32] and TaI-DPT [18],
221

for zero-shot setting, as shown in Table 1. Additionally, we utilized the fully supervised method,
222

DualCoOp[37] with our method, for zero-shot learning setting (ZSL) as presented in Table 2.
223

Table 1 summarizes the results of the zero-shot experiment on benchmark datasets. In MS-COCO [26]

performance improvements without tuning costs. Especially, the performance of ZSCLIP[32] with

our method is notably enhanced, achieving better and comparable performance to TaI-DPT [18],

which requires mild tuning. In NUSWIDE [12], we incorporate contextual text descriptions from
229

a large language model (GPT-3.5) to validate the potential of utilizing generated texts instead of
230

well-curated caption data. With provided class name of NUSWIDE [12], we readily gathered the
231

massive set of text descriptions within a short amount of time. TaI-DPT [18] is trained with the
232

public caption data from OpenImages[23]. Our method exceeds the performance of ZSCLIP[32] and
233

TaI-DPT [18] by a large margin, with improvements of 9.3 mAP and 2.6 mAP, respectively.
234

Table 2 shows the results of the zero-shot learning setting for unseen classes. In MS-COCO [26],
235

we follow the DualCoOp[37] and split the dataset into 48 seen classes and 17 unseen classes.
236

The evaluation is conducted in both zero-shot setting (ZSL, recognizing only unseen classes) and
237

generalized zero-shot setting (GZSL, recognizing both seen and unseen classes). Based on prompt
238

tuning, DualCoOp[37] trains learnable context tokens on 48 seen classes and achieves the state-of-the-
239

art performance on both ZSL and GZSL. Our method was originally designed to handle novel classes
240

(unseen classes) by leveraging text descriptions. As a result, our method significantly improved
241

the ZSL and GZSL performance of the supervised DualCoOp[37] by providing complementary
242

information. Table 1 and Table 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method performing training-
243

244

Evaluation on Few-Shot Setting. We performed comparison study with few-shot methods in multi-
245

label recognition. In TaI-DPT [18], they have investigate to confirm the effectiveness of their zero-shot
246

method. Here, we further validate our method, which is zero-shot test-time task adaption without
247

tuning costs.
248

Table 3 summarizes the results of the few-shot methods on MS-COCO dataset [26], especially using
249

1 and 5 shot samples for all classes. While existing few-shot methods [3, 35, 54, 51] demonstrated
250

the performance enhancements with an increase of labeled samples, TaI-DPT [18] and our method
251

are performed within the zero-shot setting. By applying our method with existing zero-shot methods
252

253

zero-shot setting. In the absence of labeled samples and tuning, we achieved comparable performance
254

with ML-FSL[35] and better results than other few-shot methods utilizing 5-shot samples.

Evaluation on Partially Labeled Setting. Due to high costs of annotation in multi-label image
256

recognition, training with partially labeled samples [37, 21, 31, 6] has been studied. Following

DualCoOp [37], we performed the evaluation of partially labeled setting. As shown in Table 4,
258

our method supplements the decreased performance of DualCoOp [37] caused by partially labeled
259

samples by providing complementary information during inference. Through zero-shot test time task

Ablation Study and Analysis
265

4.3.1
Effectiveness of our method
266

To verify the effectiveness of components of our method, we conducted an ablation study for analyzing
267

our method. As shown in Table 5, we first proposed a novel class concept representation with text
268

descriptions by class to ZSCLIP[32]. Since the text descriptions contain the semantic meaning among
269

multiple class names and contextual information for multi-label recognition, the alignment between
270

visual features of test image and text features are improved compared to the hand-crafted prompts as
271

shown in the Fig.1. Thus, the performance is increased by 4.1 mAP and 1.1 mAP on MS-COCO [26]
272

and VOC2007 [16], respectively. Then, we performed the context-guided visual feature using a large
273

set of text descriptions, Zall. Transforming the visual features into same text feature space as our class
274

concept representation is essential to minimize the gap between visual feature from task-agnostic
275

visual encoder and text features for each class. Constructing context-guided visual feature, our method
276

yield remarkable performance gain by 8.5 mAP and 5.3 mAP on MS-COCO [26] and VOC2007 [16],
277

respectively. Thus, we effectively designed our method that improves the alignment between visual
278

and text features.
279

4.3.2
The Number of Text Descriptions
280

We investigate the effect of the number of text descriptions for our method. As shown in Table 6,
281

we evaluated performance by increasing the number of randomly selected text descriptions from 1K
282

to 32K texts. With only 1K text descriptions, our method enhances performance by approximately

evaluation is based on mAP.

descriptions ranges from 1K to 32K, the text embeddings of Zall can cover the wider range of test
285

dataset, resulting in increased performance gains. For adapting to novel classes during inference, our
286

method not only achieves a significant performance improvement with only 1K texts but also further
287

enhances performance as the quantity of texts increases.
288

4.3.3
Analysis of Inference Time
289

We analyzed the inference time of our method depending on the number of text descriptions. When
290

extracting text embeddings from the text descriptions in advance, we measure the inference time
291

as the number of text descriptions increases. ZSCLIP[32], as the baseline model, processes each
292

sample for classification in 7.2ms. When the number of texts increases from 1K to 32K, integrating
293

ZSCLIP[32] with our method only increases the inference time by 0.4-0.5ms, with tests conducted on
294

the RTX3090. In addition, Our method (6.8GB) requires slightly more memory than ZSCLIP (6.5GB)
295

on VOC2007 [16]. Therefore, our method presents a simple and efficient approach for training-free
296

enhancement approach at inference.

Conclusion
298

In this paper, we propose a novel class concept representation from massive text descriptions for
299

training-free multi-label recognition tasks. Inspired by how humans form concepts based on words,
300

as studied in cognitive neuroscience, we replace single class name prompts with the class concept
301

representation that capture various patterns of co-occurrence with other words. To further enhance
302

alignment between multi-modal features of VLMs, we propose a context-guided visual representation
303

that is transformed onto the same linear space as the class concept representation. Remarkably,
304

our proposed method outperforms zero-shot prompt tuning methods such as TaI-DPT and achieves
305

significant enhancements over ZSCLIP and other state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods without
306

requiring parameter tuning or labeled samples, and with minimal inference time overhead.
307

Limitations. While our method achieved impressive results with training-free enhancement of CLIP,
308

it exhibits limitations. First, a significant performance gap exists compared to prompt tuning methods
309

with full samples, like DualCoOp [37]. Second, the computational memory demands of our method
310

grow at a faster rate than ZSCLIP[32] as the batch size increases.

A
Generation of Text Descriptions using LLMs
443

Our proposed method leverages the text descriptions for enhancing the alignment between the
444

visual and text features. In practice, gathering the proper text descriptions is an essential process for
445

replacing the hand-crafted prompts. As mentioned in the main paper, the text descriptions can be
446

readily gathered from benchmark dataset, web crawling, or large language models. Recent advances
447

in large language models (LLMs) enable to rapidly generate text descriptions that are similar to
448

image captions in MS-COCO [26]. Therefore, we utilized the generated text descriptions from large
449

language model. With provided class name of NUSWIDE [12], Fig. 6 illustrates the example of input
450

prompt template and corresponding generated text descriptions using GPT3.5. We carefully designed
451

the instruction of input prompt including main description, constraints, examples of bad and good
452

cases, class names of target task and output format.
453

B
Implementing Other Zero-Shot Training-Free Method
454

In single-label recognition, CALIP [19] proposed zero-shot alignment enhancement of CLIP for adapt-
455

ing target task without few-shot samples or additional training. The parameter-free attention module of
456

cross-modal interaction effectively enhances the alignment of visual and text features. CALIP utilized
457

the visual feature F =Encv(xk)∈RHW ×D via reshaping and the text feature T =Enct(P h)∈RC×D

Softmax(A/αt)T,
(5)

T a
=
Softmax(AT /αv)F
(6)

where the attention matrix is A=FT T ∈RHW ×C, αt and αv are the modulation parameters of textual
461

and visual features, respectively, and T a and F a are bidirectionally updated textual and visual features.
462

After pooling the updated visual feature F a
v ∈R1×D and the global visual feature Fv∈R1×D, the
463

classification logit S is obtained as below:
464

S = β1 · FvT T + β2 · FvT aT + β3 · F a
v T T ,
(7)

where β1, β2, β3 are the weights for the three logits.
465

CALIP [19] tuned the hyperparameters β2, β3 for each dataset while fixed β1 to be 1 for simplicity.
466

As shown in Fig. 4, we have explored the value of β2, β3 for multi-label recognition setting on
467

MS-COCO [26] and have observed that the parameter-free attention module consistently decreases
468

the mAP performance since multi-label recognition covers the identification of multiple objects
469

within an image, involving complex scene and diverse objects.
470

C
Exploring Modulation Parameters
471

For hyperparameter searching, following existing methods for classification tasks, such as zero-
472

shot [18, 19], training-free [51, 19], and test-time adaptation [42], we explore the modulation pa-
473

rameters αt by conducting ablation studies on validation set. For simplicity, we set the value of
474

αf,t to be half of αF,t. As shown in Table 7, the value of (1/αf,t, 1/αF,t) is suitable in the range
475

of (40∼80,20∼40). In the experiments of main paper, we set the (1/αf,t, 1/αF,t) as (80,40) for
476

MS-COCO [26], (60,30) for VOC2007 [16] and (40,20) for NUSWIDE [12].
477

D
Examples of Local Alignment Enhancement
478

In Fig. 5, we visualized the examples of local alignment enhancement by applying our method.
479

Enhancing local alignment is important to recognize multiple objects in a test image [37]. Our
480

proposed method enhances the local alignment between the visual features of test image and the
481

text features of each class name, thereby suppressing the false-positive prediction. Therefore, Fig. 5
482

demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
483

E
Positive and Negative Societal Impacts
484

As a positive societal impact, our method can allow people with limited computing resources to
485

achieve better performance in multi-label classification using existing vision-language models. This
486

is because it does not require extensive training or labeled data. However, as a negative societal
487

impact, the failure of classification could produce the negative side effects. For example, in security
488

applications, incorrect classification of objects could lead to false alarms or missed detections,
489

potentially compromising safety and security.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
491

1. Claims
492

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
493

paper’s contributions and scope?
494

Answer: [Yes]
495

Justification: We clearly state our contributions in both the abstract and introduction. Espe-
496

cially, we summarize our contributions in the last part of the introduction.
497

Guidelines:
498

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
499

made in the paper.
500

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
501

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
502

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
503

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
504

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
505

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
506

are not attained by the paper.
507

2. Limitations
508

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
509

Answer: [Yes]
510

Justification: We discuss the limitations of our method in conclusion.
511

Guidelines:
512

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
513

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
514

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
515

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
516

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
517

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
518

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
519

implications would be.
520

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
521

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
522

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
523

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
524

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
525

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
526

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
527

technical jargon.
528

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
529

and how they scale with dataset size.
530

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
531

address problems of privacy and fairness.
532

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
533

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
534

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
535

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
536

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
537

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
538

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
539

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
540

a complete (and correct) proof?
541

Answer: [NA]
542

17


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results, assumptions and proof.
543

Guidelines:
544

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
545

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
546

referenced.
547

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
548

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
549

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
550

proof sketch to provide intuition.
551

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
552

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
553

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
554

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
555

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
556

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
557

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
558

Answer: [Yes]
559

Justification: We provide the details of the used model, hyperparameters, source of datasets
560

and proposed algorithm for reproducing main experimental results.
561

Guidelines:
562

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
563

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
564

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
565

whether the code and data are provided or not.
566

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
567

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
568

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
569

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
570

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
571

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
572

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
573

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
574

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
575

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
576

appropriate to the research performed.
577

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
578

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
579

nature of the contribution. For example
580

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
581

to reproduce that algorithm.
582

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
583

the architecture clearly and fully.
584

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
585

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
586

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
587

the dataset).
588

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
589

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
590

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
591

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
592

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
593

5. Open access to data and code
594

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
595

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
596

material?
597

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
598

Justification: We provide open access to the code for our proposed method. In our experi-
599

ments, we utilize a publicly accessible benchmark dataset described in Section ??.
600

Guidelines:
601

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
602

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
603

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
604

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
605

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
606

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
607

benchmark).
608

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
609

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
610

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
611

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
612

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
613

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
614

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
615

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
616

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
617

versions (if applicable).
618

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
619

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
620

6. Experimental Setting/Details
621

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
622

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
623

results?
624

Answer: [Yes]
625

Justification: We provide the details of the experimental setting, including hyperparameters,
626

in Sections 4.1 and C. The generation details of the texts used in our method are also
627

provided in Section A.
628

Guidelines:
629

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
630

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
631

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
632

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
633

material.
634

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
635

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
636

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
637

Answer: [Yes]
638

Justification: We do not report the statistical significance of the experimental results, as our
639

method does not rely on statistical variables for inference.
640

Guidelines:
641

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
642

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
643

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
644

the main claims of the paper.
645

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
646

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
647

run with given experimental conditions).
648

19


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
649

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
650

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
651

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
652

of the mean.
653

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
654

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
655

of Normality of errors is not verified.
656

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
657

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
658

error rates).
659

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
660

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
661

8. Experiments Compute Resources
662

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
663

resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the
664

experiments?
665

Answer: [Yes]
666

Justification: We provide the information of types of compute worker (GPU model), memory
667

usage and inference time in Section. 4.3.3.
668

Guidelines:
669

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
670

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
671

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
672

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
673

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
674

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
675

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
676

didn’t make it into the paper).
677

9. Code Of Ethics
678

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
679

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
680

Answer: [Yes]
681

Justification: We abide by the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
682

Guidelines:
683

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
684

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
685

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
686

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
687

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
688

10. Broader Impacts
689

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
690

societal impacts of the work performed?
691

Answer: [Yes]
692

Justification: We discuss the positive and negative societal impacts of our paper in the
693

supplementary material.
694

Guidelines:
695

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
696

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
697

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
698

20


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
699

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
700

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
701

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
702

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
703

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
704

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
705

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
706

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
707

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
708

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
709

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
710

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
711

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
712

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
713

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
714

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
715

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
716

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
717

11. Safeguards
718

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
719

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
720

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
721

Answer: [NA]
722

Justification: Our paper does not pose a high risk for misuse in terms of model and dataset.
723

Guidelines:
724

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
725

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
726

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
727

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
728

safety filters.
729

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
730

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
731

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
732

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
733

faith effort.
734

12. Licenses for existing assets
735

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
736

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
737

properly respected?
738

Answer: [Yes]
739

Justification: We cite the papers that provide datasets, code and models in the Section. 4.
740

Guidelines:
741

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
742

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
743

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
744

URL.
745

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
746

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
747

service of that source should be provided.
748

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
749

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
750

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
751

license of a dataset.
752

21


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
753

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
754

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
755

the asset’s creators.
756

13. New Assets
757

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
758

provided alongside the assets?
759

Answer: [Yes]
760

Justification: We provide the detail documentation for the code in our submission.
761

Guidelines:
762

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
763

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
764

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
765

limitations, etc.
766

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
767

asset is used.
768

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
769

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
770

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
771

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
772

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
773

well as details about compensation (if any)?
774

Answer: [NA]
775

Justification: Our paper does not involve neither crowdsourcing nor research with human
776

subjects.
777

Guidelines:
778

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
779

human subjects.
780

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
781

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
782

included in the main paper.
783

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
784

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
785

collector.
786

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
787

Subjects
788

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
789

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
790

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
791

institution) were obtained?
792

Answer: [NA]
793

Justification: Our paper does not involve neither crowdsourcing nor research with human
794

subjects.
795

Guidelines:
796

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
797

human subjects.
798

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
799

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
800

should clearly state this in the paper.
801

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
802

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
803

guidelines for their institution.
