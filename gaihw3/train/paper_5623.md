Abstract

Surgical video-language pretraining (VLP) faces unique challenges due to the
knowledge domain gap and the scarcity of multi-modal data. This study aims to
bridge the gap by addressing issues regarding textual information loss in surgical
lecture videos and the spatial-temporal challenges of surgical VLP. To tackle these
issues, we propose a hierarchical knowledge augmentation approach and a novel
Procedure-Encoded Surgical Knowledge-Augmented Video-Language Pretraining
(PeskaVLP) framework. The proposed knowledge augmentation approach uses
large language models (LLM) to refine and enrich surgical concepts, thus providing
comprehensive language supervision and reducing the risk of overfitting. The
PeskaVLP framework combines language supervision with visual self-supervision,
constructing hard negative samples and employing a Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) based loss function to effectively comprehend the cross-modal procedural
alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple public surgical scene understanding
and cross-modal retrieval datasets show that our proposed method significantly
improves zero-shot transferring performance and offers a generalist visual repre-
sentation for further advancements in surgical scene understanding. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/PeskaVLP.

Introduction

The recent advancements in multi-modal representation learning, particularly with the introduction of
CLIP [52], have led to the development of models capable of understanding a wide range of visual
concepts using natural language supervision [34, 41]. The expressive natural language has allowed
these models to shift from task-specific to more generalist applications [49, 82, 83]. The learned
representations of these models are robust, facilitating effective performance across diverse visual
tasks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning [68, 81]. However, despite the impressive progress
made by these models in the general computer vision domain, the effectiveness of these methods in
domain-specific settings remains uncertain.

This concern is particularly relevant to the field of Surgical Data Science (SDS), an emerging
interdisciplinary domain that utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to analyze
surgical data [44, 43, 74]. A key component of SDS is the analysis of intraoperative surgical videos
captured through endoscopes or laparoscopes. Analyzing these videos presents several unique
challenges compared to the general computer vision datasets. Unlike general computer vision
datasets [47, 52, 7], surgical videos can last several hours and capture complex and fine-grained
activities within a narrow field of view. This requires development of computational approaches to
decompose and model the surgical procedures at multiple hierarchical levels, including the entire

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

procedure [29], phases [67, 16], steps [54, 31], atomic actions [6, 8], and action triplets [50, 62].
Moreover, surgical language involves specialized vocabulary, and annotating videos requires clinical
expertise, limiting dataset scalability. Consequently, current deep learning applications are restricted
to single-centric, fully-supervised, and task-specific approaches [3, 6, 31, 50, 55, 57, 67, 69, 74].

To bridge the gap, recent efforts have focused on creating surgical video-text pretraining datasets by
curating surgical lecture videos from online e-learning platforms and pairing them with transcribed
narrations using audio speech recognition (ASR) methods. Subsequently, a CLIP-style model [76] is
trained contrastively to match the video clips to their corresponding textual descriptions. Building on
this, the HecVL approach introduces hierarchical texts, including phase-level keystep descriptions
and video-level summaries that provide hierarchical goals of the surgical procedure [75]. However,
challenges persist due to the smaller size of the surgical video-language pretraining dataset, noisy
transcribed narrations, limited variability in phase-level descriptions, and strong temporal dependen-
cies in surgical procedures, where actions and keysteps occur in a specific routine order. These issues
hinder the accurate learning of multi-modal surgical representations.

To address these challenges, we propose Procedure-Encoded Surgical Knowledge-Augmented Video-
Language Pretraining (PeskaVLP), which boosts data efficacy and tackles the spatial-temporal
challenges inherent in surgical procedures from two perspectives. First, we introduce hierarchical
knowledge augmentation to mitigate the problem of textual information loss in surgical video-
language pretraining datasets. We argue that the internal knowledge of LLMs serves as a valuable
surgical knowledge base, enriching and correcting text descriptions while preserving the original
key concepts and meanings. Therefore, we utilize the large language model (LLM) prompted with
different behaviors as an external knowledge base to correct, explain, or summarize the hierarchical
texts in the surgical video-language pretraining dataset, thus providing diverse and better language
supervision for multi-modal pretraining. Additionally, it reduces the risk of overfitting by preventing
the text encoder from repeatedly encountering the same keystep texts in each epoch.

From the pretraining objective perspective, we perform the hierarchical video-language pretraining,
as shown in Fig. 1, with a novel hierarchy-specific loss, LecNCE. Specifically, we combine
language supervision with visual self-supervision at the clip-level pretraining to introduce additional
supervision signals within vision modality, making the pretraining efficient with a small surgical
dataset [76]. At phase- and video-level pretraining, we construct hard negative samples by reversing
the order of texts, followed by a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based loss function to learn the

temporal alignment between video frames and texts, thus facilitating the understanding of cross-modal
procedural alignment during pretraining.

We summarize our contributions as follows: First, we propose an LLM-based knowledge augmen-
tation to handle surgery-specific textual information loss in the dataset, providing more densely
interconnected natural language supervision from surgical lecture videos. Second, our proposed
hierarchical video-language pretraining method enforces the understanding of the spatial-temporal
characteristics of surgical lecture videos at different hierarchical levels. The pretrained PeskaVLP
demonstrates state-of-the-art transferability and visual representation to different surgical scene
understanding downstream datasets [67, 69, 31], across types of surgical procedures and clinical
centers. It also shows strong multi-modal alignment ability through the cross-modal retrieval task at
multiple hierarchical levels.

Related Works

Surgical Video-Language Pretraining: many works have demonstrated the effectiveness of learning
visual representations from the natural language supervision of corresponding text [7, 70, 77, 40, 46,
42, 34]. These methods conduct contrastive learning [51] to match the video clips (or images) with
their corresponding narrations (or captions). Similarly in the medical field, recent works have started
to curate large-scale multi-modal data through hospital-sourced chest radiological reports [28, 12]
and online platforms [76, 27, 26], e.g., YouTube and Twitter, to perform vision-language pretraining.
However, these works encounter the sample efficiency issue when handling the smaller surgical
video-language pretraining dataset (SVL) [76]. Recent works improve the data efficacy and zero-shot
performance of CLIP-style models [48, 37, 25]. However, they do not capture procedural dependency
from the long-form surgical videos beyond the video clip and text matching. Hierarchical pretraining
methods [4, 79, 75] propose to pair video clips of different durations to different hierarchical levels of
texts, covering both short- and long-term understanding. Paprika [80] builds a procedural knowledge
graph and elicits the knowledge node during the video-language pretraining process.

Textual Augmentation with Knowledge Base: the success of vision-language pretraining is highly
dependent on the quality and quantity of available multi-modal data. Recent research [38] shows
that a smaller high-quality dataset can outperform a larger low-quality dataset. Common practices
improve the quality by textual augmentation, including EDA [37], masked token modeling [65],
and captioning loss [72]. Recent studies have used synthesized captions from captioning models to
achieve notable improvements [33, 32, 58]. However, they show scalability deficiency and world
knowledge loss in models trained with synthetic captions [73], which their initial benchmark success
has largely obscured. To inject the knowledge, K-Lite [63] enriches the texts with WordNet [15]
and Wiktionary [45] knowledge base. Merlot [78] learns script knowledge representations from
millions of YouTube videos, however, a knowledge domain gap exists when applying this to the
surgical field. The recent advent of large language models like GPT4 [2] and Llama series [66] have
been a game-changer, as they encode rich domain-specific knowledge, e.g., clinical knowledge [64],
motivating LaCLIP [14] to augment textual inputs through the LLM rewrites.

Dataset and Contrastive Learning

Learning joint video and language embedding space requires a large-scale video-language dataset,
however, such datasets are expensive and time-consuming to create in the surgical field. Therefore,
the first surgical video-language pretraining dataset, i.e., SVL [76], is proposed by obtaining around
a thousand surgical lecture videos from surgical education platforms. SVL collects ∼300 hours of
lecture videos accompanied by narration texts obtained using Audio Speech Recognition (ASR)
methods, providing ∼26k video clip-narration pairs for contrastive video-language pretraining.
Specifically, short video clips xc and their corresponding narration texts yn are treated as positive
pairs Pn, and the unpaired ones are treated as negative pairs N n. Then, the contrastive training loss

where B represents the batch size. The f and g are visual and textual encoders that generate
embedding vectors for videos and texts, respectively. This loss function aligns two modalities by
increasing the cosine similarity between paired videos and texts and decreasing the unpaired ones,
as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Despite reaching an impressive data scale, the imprecision of the ASR
system and the scarcity of surgical lecture videos limit the natural language supervision from SVL.
Therefore, HecVL [75] proposes to incorporate hierarchical language supervision by extracting
additional phase-level keystep and video-level abstract texts from lecture videos’ metadata, as shown
in Fig. 1 (b) and (c). In this work, we use this hierarchical video-language pretraining dataset and
perform hierarchical knowledge augmentation to improve the textual quality.

3.2
Hierarchical Knowledge Augmentation

Quality of language supervision in the multi-modal representation learning matters [1, 37, 36],
especially when the surgical video-language dataset is not “big” enough, e.g., millions of multi-modal
samples used in [52, 47], to sufficiently cover the visual-linguistic concepts. In this work, we find
that the texts suffer from different types of degradation at different hierarchies, failing to provide
accurate and broad concepts for pretraining. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, narration texts are
mostly sentence fragments and easily affected by misspelling errors, therefore altering the original
key concepts. The keystep texts are mostly short and abstract, resulting in a narrow set of linguistic
concepts that could show poor transferability to the downstream datasets, which usually come with
a different set of concepts [63, 18]. The abstract texts sometimes include redundant and useless
information, such as author and citation information.

To address the above hierarchy-specific textual degradation, we propose a hierarchical knowledge
augmentation to correct, explain, and summarize the narration, the keystep, and the abstract texts,
respectively, by eliciting LLM’s encoded surgical knowledge [64]. For each hierarchy, we manually
design the system prompt and several input-output examples for LLM. Thus, we obtain hierarchical
LLM assistants with different behaviors of using internal surgical knowledge to augment the texts:

pretraining.

Narration. We ask the LLM to behave as a “recipe” to come up with a list of sequential steps that
complete the given surgery. For each lecture video, we feed its title as input and obtain the list
of pseudo steps, as shown in Fig. 2 (a), building a surgical step knowledge base. Then, we assign
these pseudo steps to narration texts based on textual similarity. This implicitly corrects the typos in
transcribed narrations and augments the textual input based on the LLM’s surgical knowledge.

Keystep. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), we ask the LLM to behave like a “dictionary” to explain the
meaning of the keystep. Specifically, the LLM assistant expands the given keystep into a description
of the main surgical events, anatomies, and instruments involved. This enlarges the textual semantic
information of each keystep and provides more expressive language supervision for pertaining.

Abstract. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), we ask the LLM to behave like a “summarizer” that captures
the key concepts of the given abstract texts, e.g., surgical type, anatomies, and so on. This reduces
the length of the textual inputs while maintaining the main concepts of the abstract paragraph. In
the following experiment, we randomly input the original or augmented texts for video-language
pretraining. Check Appendix H for examples of pre- and post-augmented texts.

3.3
Procedure-aware Surgical Video-language Pretraining

We introduce PeskaVLP, a procedure-aware pretraining framework for the above surgical knowledge-
augmented video-language dataset. We emphasize devising a pretraining objective LecNCE for the
hierarchical video-text pairs. For clip-level pretraining, LecNCEclip combines language supervision
with visual self-supervision to improve data efficiency and boost the scene understanding on visually
similar laparoscopic images. LecNCEphase/video considers the procedure awareness during the
coarser-level pretraining, through a DTW-based contrastive regularization objective with temporally
reversed text sequences as negative samples. We apply the dual-encoder as our model architecture.

3.3.1
Clip-level Pretraining

Language Supervision.
The common pretraining objective for dual-encoder model is
InfoNCE [51], as denoted in Eq. 1, where matched video text pairs are treated as positive while

5


---Page Break---
all other pairwise combinations in the batch are regarded as negative. In this work, we also ap-
ply InfoNCE to maximize the similarity between short-term video clips and their corresponding
narration texts at the clip level, denoted as Lvl
clip. However, this simple objective is data hungry
and sensitive to the weakly aligned noisy video-text pairs from small-scale surgical video-language
datasets, such as SVL [76].

Visual Self-supervision. The proposed PeskaVLP approach introduces an additional supervision
signal from visual self-supervision to complement noisy language supervision. Specifically, we
explore the widespread supervision within visual modality to learn generic visual representation. We
adopt the simple yet effective SimSiam [11] strategy that aims to maximize the similarity between
two augmented views. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), during the pretraining, we apply random distortion
on the frames of video clips and generate two augmented embedding vectors for one video clip. We
then apply InfoNCE to maximize the similarity of these two augmented embeddings by treating
them as positive pairs, denoted as Lvv
clip. This additional supervisory can learn visual features more
efficiently and is robust to the distortion of surgical scene images. Finally, the LecNCE loss for
clip-level pretraining is the sum of these two losses, denoted as LecNCEclip = Lvl
clip + Lvv
clip.

3.3.2
Phase-/Video-level Pretraining

The surgical video-language pretraining presents a unique procedural challenge compared to the
existing video-language methods [19, 47, 52, 71, 61]. The surgical actions and events occur in a
certain order to follow the routine to complete the surgical phase and surgery, e.g., “hook dissecting
cystic duct” should happen before “clipper cutting cystic duct” in the “clipping cutting” phase
of cholecystectomy surgery. However, prior contrastive learning objectives [46, 52, 19] omit this
temporal dependency and limit the understanding of procedural knowledge in surgical lecture videos.

Our proposed LecNCE training objective enables procedural understanding in phase- and video-
level pretraining by considering the cross-modal temporal alignment between video frames and text
sequence. Specifically, hierarchical texts can form the parent-child correspondence, i.e., abstract
(parent-level) and keystep (child-level) texts, keystep (parent-level) and narration (child-level) texts.
As shown in Fig. 3 (b), each parent-level text A is paired with a video segment V = {v1, ...vT },
where the T is the number of frames of the video segment. A is also paired with a child-level text
sequence B = {b1, ...bN}, where N is the length of this sequence. Then, we build the cost matrix
C ∈RT ×N between video frames and child-level text sequence based on their embeddings, with
each element ci,j computed by a distance function D. We adopt the same distance function from [21]:

ci,j = D(vi, bj) = −log
exp(˜v⊤
i ˜bj/β)
PN
k=1 exp(˜v⊤
i ˜bk/β)
,
˜vi = f(vi)/∥f(vi)∥2
˜bi = g(bi)/∥g(bi)∥2

(2)
Using this cost matrix C, we apply Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to find the minimum cross-modal
cost path that aligns the video frames to the text sequence, denoted as DTW(C). We then make a
reasonable assumption that the global semantics of the text sequence and its reversed version are
distinct. Therefore, aligning the video frames to the text sequence should be easier, i.e., incur a lower
alignment cost compared to aligning the same video frames when the text sequence is played in
reverse. Following this assumption, we temporally reverse the child-level texts into ˆB = {bn, ...b1}
and build the cost matrix ˆC between V and ˆB, computing the minimum alignment cost DTW( ˆC).
We then devise a DTW-based contrastive regularization using hinge loss as follows:

Ldtw = max(DTW(C) −DTW( ˆC)), ϕ)
(3)

where ϕ is the margin between positive and negative samples. This imposed regularization can
support fine-grained multi-modal representation learning from weakly paired video frames and
texts via temporal alignment. Unlike Paprika [80], which relies on a pretrained model [46], our
phase-/video-level pretraining provides a direct, lightweight, and more adaptable methodology to
unseen surgical domains. We do not require the adaption from any existing models, improving
the generalization capability. Also, our pretraining process is procedure-aware in itself rather than
modifying the representation in a second step, streamlining the process and increasing efficiency.
We also apply the InfoNCE loss to maximize the similarity between the paired parent-level text,
video segment, and child-level texts, denoted as Linfonce. Note that the Linfonce follows the same
pipeline as in Fig. 1 (b) and (c). Finally, we achieve the loss LecNCE for phase- or video-level

6


---Page Break---
pretraining as LecNCEphase/video = Linfonce + λLdtw, where λ is the hyper-parameter to scale
two losses. Please refer to Appendix D for more details about dynamic time warping. Finally, we
train the model in an alternating way, using the proposed hierarchical levels of learning objectives.
We only train one set of visual and textual encoders for all three levels, ensuring the encoders are
optimized for capturing both short-term and long-term semantics. We alternatively train with 25
batches of clip-level samples, followed by 15 and 115 batches of phase- and video-level samples.

Experiments

Datasets. Our pretraining is conducted on the videos of SVL [76] dataset. The pertaining dataset
includes hierarchical textual annotations from the metadata of the videos [75]. We evaluate our
model on 3 publicly available surgical phase recognition downstream datasets, i.e., Cholec80 [67]
(cholecystectomy) from Strasbourg center, AutoLaparo [69] (hysterectomy) from HongKong hospital,
MultiBypass140 [31] (gastric bypass) from both Strasbourg (StrasBypass70) and Bern (BernBy-
pass70) centers. These datasets contain untrimmed surgical workflows with frame-wise phase labels.
We also evaluate pretrained model on the cross-modal retrieval task in multiple hierarchical levels
with holdout videos in SVL-Retrieval [76]. Check Appendix A for more details about pretraining
dataset.

Training Parameters. We utilize the dual-encoder architecture with ResNet50 [23] as visual encoder
and ClinicalBert [24] as textual encoder, respectively. We train the model with a batch size of
120/80/25 for clip-/phase-/video-level, respectively. We sample 4/16/64 frames for videos of clip-
/phase-/video-level. We use AdamW optimizer [30] with a learning rate of 5e −5. We train the
model with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs each having a DRAM of 80 GB for 200 epochs. Temperature
parameter β for distance function and ϕ for DTW-base contrastive loss function D are fixed as 0.1.
Scale factor λ is set as 0.01.

Evaluation Setup. We evaluate pretrained models using two setups: Zero-Shot evaluation and
Few/Full-shot Linear Probing evaluation. For Zero-Shot, we utilize class text prompts, the same as
HecVL [75], to compute cosine similarities between image embedding and class text embeddings,
classifying images based on the shortest distance. In Linear Probing, the pretrained visual encoder
remains frozen when we extract features for each image, subsequently training a linear layer using
the SGD optimizer. For few-shot linear probing, we train the linear layer with a few numbers of
videos, referred to as k-% training, where k indicates the percentage of all the videos used in training.
Check Appendix B for more details.

Table 1: Zero-shot phase recognition results. We report Accuracy / F1-Score. PeskaVLP outperforms
the other methods across different tasks. We report the state-of-the-art methods that are fine-tuned
on the downstream dataset in a fully-supervised manner. However, models fine-tuned on specific
downstream datasets show limited generalizability across procedures and institutions.

Zero-shot Surgical Phase Recognition

High-quality Surgical Video-language Dataset. As shown in Table 1, our approach achieves a
significant performance improvement over the baselines MIL-NCE [46] and CLIP [52] pretrained
on the natural computer vision datasets, even though our pretraining dataset is 10, 000 times smaller

---Page Break---
than those. Note that when the CLIP model is randomly initialized and then trained with SVL, its
performance declines compared to initializing from OpenAI. This shows that our surgical video-
language pretraining dataset lacks the scale necessary to adequately pretrain a robust video-language
model from scratch. ViT [13, 9] architectures are sensitive to initialization and excluded from this
work. Further insights into the impact of initialization can be found in Appendix C.

Transferability across Surgical Procedures and Centers. Compared to the HecVL, our method
achieves over 12.3% and 7.8% improvement in absolute accuracy and f1, thanks to our spatial-
temporal LecNCE learning objective across multiple hierarchies. Also, the consistent boost on
cholecystectomy [67], hysterectomy [69], and gastric bypass [? ] procedures show the generalizable
and transferable features of PeskaVLP. Comparing the results of StrasBypass and BernBypass, we
find that PeskaVLP can recognize the phases of the same kind of surgery (gastric bypass), even if
these surgeries are performed in different centers and follow different procedural routines. More
qualitative results can be found in Appendix F.

In our study, we evaluate pretrained models’ cross-modal alignment efficacy by conducting both
zero-shot text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks in multiple hierarchical levels. We report the
Recall@N metric by identifying the retrieved nearest neighbors for each query and then determining
whether the corresponding ground truth element is within the top N nearest neighbors, where N ∈
{1, 5, 10}. Table 2 shows that our PeskaVLP achieves superior performance due to the procedure-
aware learning objective in hierarchical pretraining. Particularly, the hierarchical pretraining scheme
significantly boosts the cross-modal retrieval at the coarse-grained video-text pairs, comprehending
the relationship between long video segments and high-level sentences with surgical terms.

Few-/Full-shot Linear Probing

General Visual Representation for Surgical Scene Understanding. We present the few- and
full-shot linear-probing evaluation in Table 3. It shows that the learned visual representation from
PeskaVLP provides a general visual representation for surgical scene understanding across surgical
procedures. We also find that the MoCo v2 [55, 22] pretrained on the frames of the SVL dataset
(second row of Table 3) in a visual self-supervised manner achieves better visual representation
than pretraining on a public dataset that only contains one type of surgery, e.g., Cholec80 (third
row in Table 3). This shows that the cross-procedure surgical pretraining dataset enables better
generalizationability.

Knowledge Augmentation and Hierarchical Pretraining. Interestingly, the model pretrained
contrastively with short video clips and narrations (SurgVLP) performs worse than MoCo v2 [55, 22]
(second row in Table 3) in linear probing evaluation. This may be because the noisy narrations do not
provide accurate natural language supervision for visual representation learning, thus highlighting the

importance of visual self-supervision and textual quality. Our model surpasses the prior methods by a
large margin, showing the efficacy of our hierarchical knowledge augmentation, which denoises the
text and improves textual quality. Also, our proposed LecNCE promotes the visual encoder through
additional visual self-supervision and procedural understanding. We present t-SNE visualizations of
learned features in Appendix E, which shows that our multi-modal representations exhibit a smaller
modality gap, enhancing transferability to vision-and-language downstream tasks [20, 39].

Ablation Studies

Effect of Knowledge Augmentation. Table 4 presents the effect of our proposed LLM-based hierar-
chical knowledge-aware augmentation strategy, applied to the texts of SVL dataset. The first row of
the table corresponds to HecVL [75] pretrained on SVL with only conventional visual augmentations,
e.g., blurring and so on, without any knowledge augmentation. The results clearly demonstrate
that simple visual augmentation strategies exhibit poor robustness as the texts of SVL are noisy
and not diverse enough. Conversely, our knowledge-aware text augmentation consistently improves
performance across multiple surgical datasets, highlighting the importance of the textual quality of

the surgical video-language pretraining dataset. We found that integrating visual self-supervision with
language supervision significantly enhances performance in surgical scene understanding tasks across
downstream datasets. Additionally, using a procedure-aware learning objective improves surgical
phase recognition for routine procedures, such as cholecystectomy (Cholec80), more effectively than
complex procedures, like hysterectomy (Autolaparo).

Effect of Pretraining Objective. Table 4 shows the impact of our learning objective for hierarchical
surgical video-language pretraining. When we append visual self-supervision to language supervision
at the clip-level pretraining, the zero-shot performance is clearly improved. This improvement can
be attributed to the added diverse and high-quality supervision. Also, the boost at linear-probing
evaluation shows that the combination of language supervision and visual self-supervision leads to
a robust visual representation especially with a moderate size of surgical video-language dataset,
e.g., SVL. Table 4 also highlights that the inclusion of LecNCE with procedure understanding
consistently improves performance across most downstream datasets, leading to enhanced accuracy
in both zero-shot and linear-probing. However, performance on the AutoLaparo degrades with this
modification. This may be due to challenging or less routined surgical procedures in the pretraining
dataset.

Conclusion, Limitations and Broader Impact

Conclusion. We have introduced a surgical video-language pretraining method for long-term surgical
lecture videos and their hierarchical paired texts. Our proposed knowledge augmentation addresses
the hierarchical textual information loss by integrating the large language model’s internal surgical
knowledge. Also, we propose a novel spatial-temporal pretraining objective for video-text pairs of
different hierarchies, which addresses the lack of supervision signals problem in a small surgical
vision-language dataset. The proposed LecNCE also addresses the procedural awareness problem,
benefiting the long-term cross-modal understanding. The experiments show that our proposed
PeskaVLP achieves the state-of-the-art generalized zero-shot ability and visual representation learning
that can serve as a general initialization for many surgical scene understanding tasks.

Limitations. While our LLM-augmented strategy enhances textual information, it may overly
standardize the text, raising concerns about overfitting during pretraining. Therefore, it is crucial
to strike a balance between leveraging LLM capabilities and maintaining the variability present
in real-world surgical narratives. To address this, future work will explore incorporating diverse
audio inputs and spontaneous narratives into the pretraining process, ensuring that the model retains
robustness and adaptability in real-world applications. Additionally, even though the SVL pretraining
dataset covers diverse laparoscopic surgeries, it lacks surgeries in different organs, such as the brain
and heart. To address this, we plan to expand the pretraining dataset using diverse media such as
textbooks, instructional videos, and intraoperative video recordings from diverse sources. We also
aim to diversify the pretraining dataset by considering laparoscopic, endoscopic, and microscopic
surgeries on different organs, to further mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance the model’s
generalizability.

Broader Impact. The primary goal of surgical data science is to develop novel context-aware
support systems for the operating room by collecting large-scale surgical data and analyzing it
with modern AI techniques, eventually improving the safety and efficacy of surgical outcomes.
The recent advancements in vision-language-based multi-modal AI offer significant potential in
achieving this goal by enabling the development of more robust and generalizable models. These
multi-modal systems have the potential to support clinical decision-making, streamline surgical
workflows, provide real-time intra-operative guidance to improve surgical precision, reduce errors,
and optimize outcomes in the operating room. During the development, patient data privacy should
be considered as a fundamental ethical requirement. These systems developed on real-world surgical
data also hold transformative potential in medical education, enhancing training and skill development
in both novice and experienced surgeons.

A
Pretraining Dataset

A.1
Videos

We start with the videos that are used for surgical vision-language pretraining in [76]. In total, there
are 1, 326 surgical lecture videos. These videos are transcribed by AWS [5] and Whisper [53] audio
speech recognition (ASR) to obtain the corresponding narration texts. Furthermore, we curate the
videos’ metadata from the online platforms to obtain the extra keystep and abstract texts. In the phase-
and video-level pretraining, we need parent- and child-level text correspondences, e.g., keystep and
its corresponding narration texts, to perform procedure understanding. Therefore, we filter out the
videos that do not have parent-child correspondences. In total, we have 1, 007 and 920 videos for
phase- and video-level pretraining, respectively.

A.2
Misspelling Error

As the narration texts are generated from the audio using the ASR system, they usually contain many
misspelling errors and fragment sentences. Therefore, we apply multiple preprocessing steps to clean
the narration texts.

We first built the vocabulary based on the textbook, surgical category labels, and definition words.
Specifically, we refer to the academic papers, which define the surgical phases, to curate a list of
definition words and build a vocabulary that contains the words of interest. We also parse and merge
the words from the textbook. In total, we obtain a vocabulary of the size of 51, 640 words. Then, we
use the built vocabulary along with the spell-checking algorithm 1 to correct the misspelling errors in
narration texts. The algorithm utilizes Levenshtein Distance to identify words within 2 edit distances
from the original. It then cross-references these permutations (insertions, deletions, replacements,
and transpositions) with a word frequency list, prioritizing words with higher occurrence frequencies
as potential correct results.

B
Evaluation Setup

We provide a detailed description of the downstream tasks and their settings that we apply in the
experiment.

Surgical Phase Recognition.
Surgical phase recognition is a proxy task to test the model’s
surgical scene understanding ability. It aims to classify the frame of surgical video into predefined
classes (phases), requiring the model to understand the instrument and anatomy’s presence and their
interactions by extracting visual patterns from the surgical scene image. In this work, we ignore
temporal modeling in surgical phase recognition as we focus on multi-modal representation learning.
We consider phase recognition as a frame-wise image classification problem. In the surgical phase
recognition task, we evaluate the model’s performance based on the publicly available datasets,
including Cholec80 [67], AutoLaparo [69] and MultiBypass [? ].

• Zero-shot Evaluation. As the surgical phase labels are high-level definitions that can be
decomposed into a few basic concepts, we manually construct the contextual prompts for
phase labels, as shown in Tab. 5, Tab. 6 and Tab. 7. Our constructed prompts for the class
names are built with the help of clinician’s comments, considering the involved surgical
instruments, anatomies, and events involved in a given surgical phase.

• Linear-probing Evaluation. For linear-probing evaluation on the surgical phase recogni-
tion downstream datasets, we keep the visual encoder frozen and train a linear classifier on
the extracted features. We do not apply any image augmentation during the training. The
learning rate is scaled linearly based on the actual batch size. The model is optimized using
SGD optimizer with the learning rate as 0.001 and weight decay parameter as 0.0005. We
train the model for 40 epochs. We fit the model on the training and validation sets and report
the performance on the separate test set. For the few-shot linear-probing evaluation, we
adopt a k-percentage shot approach with a slight modification to accommodate the nature of
surgical videos, which contain frames from different classes. Specifically, we select 10%

Cross-modal Retrieval. Cross-modal retrieval includes text-based video retrieval and video-based
text retrieval. Here, we conduct the cross-modal retrieval at three hierarchical levels. We collect 537
clip-narration (clip-level) video-text pairs, 746 phase-keystep (phase-level) video-text pairs, and 86
video-abstract (video-level) video-text pairs from hold-out testing videos of SVL [76]. There are
more phase-keystep than clip-narration video-text pairs because some testing videos do not have
cleaned narrations and we filter them out. For video embedding generation, we sample multiple
frames fro m the video and average pool their image embeddings. We temporally sample 10 frames
for clip-/phase-/video-level videos. We conduct the zero-shot evaluation for the cross-modal retrieval
task.

C
Architecture & Initialization

As mentioned before, the current surgical vision-language pretraining dataset lacks the scale necessary
to pretrain a robust vision-language model from scratch, therefore a good choice of architecture and
initialization is important. In this section, we conduct the experiment and study the effect of different
model architectures and initializations, justifying our choice of using ResNet50 architecture with
ImageNet initialization as our starting point before the video-language pretraining.

• ResNet50. For ImageNet initialization, we use public IMAGENET1K_V1 weights from
torchvision. Random initialization means that we random initialize the visual encoder before
the hierarchical vision-language pretraining. These models’ textual encoders are initialized
from BioClinicalBert [24]. For CLIP initialization, we initialize the visual and textual
encoder from OpenAI’s weight [52].

• ViT-B/16. For ImageNet initialization, we use weights from the official Google JAX imple-
mentation, which is pretrained on ImageNet21k [56] and then finetune on ImageNet1k [59].
We use the public pretrained weights from [10] for Dino initialization.

In our work, we choose ResNet50 over Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) due to its superior perfor-
mance and lower parameter amounts in the context of video-language pretraining for surgical data.
Our experiments demonstrated that ResNet50, particularly when initialized with CLIP weights,
outperformed ViT-B/16 across various tasks, including zero-shot and linear-probing evaluations on
Cholec80 and Autolaparo datasets. Despite the advanced capabilities of vision transformers, their
performance heavily depends on large-scale pretraining datasets, which might not always be available
or optimal for specialized domains like surgical scenes. Conversely, convolutional neural networks
like ResNet50 have shown robust generalization abilities, even when pretrained on natural images,
making them more suitable for our specific application. Additionally, the initialization sensitivity
observed in ViT-B/16 further justified our preference for ResNet50, ensuring a more reliable and
effective starting point for our hierarchical vision-language pretraining.

D
Dynamic Time Warping

After achieving the cost matrix C and ˆC, we perform dynamic time warping (DTW) [60] to find
the minimum cost path to align the frames of video segment V = {v1, ...vT } to the text sequence
B = {b1, ...bN} and reversed text sequence {bN, ...b1}, respectively, as shown in Algorithm. 1. We
follow [71] to process the DTW function into differentiable, enabling the gradient back-propagation.
The differentiable loss function is the same as [21].

A significant advantage of using DTW is that it does not require additional temporal modules,
such as recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms, to model temporal relationships. This
simplification allows us to focus on learning better representations by directly aligning video frames
and text sequences based on their semantics.

E
Modality Gap

Modality gap is a geometric phenomenon observed in the embedding space of multi-modal mod-
els [39]. This gap illustrates that pretrained multi-modal (vision-language) models create a joint
embedding space where different modalities, such as images and text, are kept at a significant distance
from each other. During contrastive optimization, this separation created at initialization is maintained
to the extent that irrelevant image embeddings can be closer to each other than to their corresponding
relevant text embeddings. This spatial disparity in the embedding space hinders the model’s ability
to effectively align and understand the relationships between visual and textual data, leading to
suboptimal performance in tasks requiring integrated multi-modal comprehension. The existence
of the modality gap is particularly detrimental when adapting pretrained vision-language models to
cross-modal generation tasks, such as image captioning. As highlighted by several studies [35, 20],
narrowing modality gap correlates with improved performance in cross-modal tasks.

As shown in Fig. 4, we visualize the embeddings of videos and their corresponding text descriptions
at three hierarchical levels: clip-narration, phase-keystep, and video-abstract. Our proposed model
demonstrates a significant reduction in the modality gap compared to the SurgVLP model. This align-
ment across different hierarchical levels ensures a more comprehensive and cohesive understanding
of the multi-modal data, leading to superior performance in tasks like image captioning and other
vision-language applications.

the modality gap incurred from the initialization after the hierarchical pretraining.

F
Surgical Phase Recognition Results

We demonstrate the zero-shot surgical phase recognition to reflect the surgical scene understanding
ability of our pretrained model. Our model can identify surgical phases of different types of surgical
procedures without any finetuning. Both success and failure examples are shown.

Surgical Term Understanding. In Fig. 5, we show that the pretrained model excels at identifying
the “washing” phase in surgical procedures, demonstrating its capability to accurately recognize
high-level surgical activities. This proficiency enhances surgical assistance systems, improving
real-time analysis and decision-making in operating rooms.

Instrument Identification. In Fig. 6, we demonstrate how the visual embedding is significantly
influenced by the presence of surgical instruments. Specifically, in the first row, the semantic meaning
of the image changes from "calot triangle dissection" to "clip and cut" due to the appearance of a
hook, even though the other anatomical features remain similar.

G
Limitations

As the pretraining process at clip-level requires additional supervision signals, i.e., visual self-
supervision, the memory and computation overhead increase compared to the vanilla HecVL pretrain-
ing. Also, during the phase- and video-level pretraining, the process of dynamic time warping can be
time-consuming because it is based on dynamic programming, slowing down the pretraining iteration
when handling longer-term surgical videos. Additionally, the knowledge augmentation on keystep

and abstract texts need to be modified to fit the other video-language pretraining datasets [4, 79] as
their hierarchical paired texts are annotated manually. Instead, our knowledge augmentation is more
suitable for videos in the wild from online platforms. To address these limitations, future work could
focus on developing a general textual augmentation strategy using the LLM’s internal knowledge,
adapting to the instructional videos that miss keystep and abstract text descriptions. Furthermore,
techniques for decentralizing the video-language pretraining could be explored, aiming to pretrain
with multi-centric vision-language samples while preserving privacy using the federated learning
strategy. This could address the scaling problem in surgical vision-language pretraining and improve
the generalizationability across the centers.

Knowledge Augmentation

language models can be elicited to build the external knowledge base.

Build Surgical Knowledge Base. In Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, we show that the knowledge of large
language model can be used to enrich the semantics of the hierarchical texts, i.e., narrations, keysteps,

textual diversity and preventing overfitting.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our experimental results on multiple datasets are consistent with the claims in
the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitation in the Appendix G.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

26


---Page Break---
Justification: We do not include the theoretical assumption and experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the detailed experiment setup in the Experiments section and
appendix. Our model is evaluated on the public dataset. We will also provide the model
weights and config file to reproduce the results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

27


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We are working on cleaning the code for now as it is a systematic codebase
that is related to multiple research works. We will release the code after the acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Experiments section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The video-language pretraining is too computationally expensive to provide
the error bar. We fix the random seed for the reproducibility.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

28


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Experiment section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our code follows the code of ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The social impact is minor in our work as we create the dataset from the open
educational platforms, which are open to any learner.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

29


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Unlike generative models, this work provides generalist scene understanding
as the foundation module for surgical data science. The data are anonymized because of the
model encoding.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will cite the original owners’ assets when we release the codebase.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

30


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will provide the documentation along with the code and dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not involve crowd-sourcing and human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not involve crowd-sourcing and human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

31


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
