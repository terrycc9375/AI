Abstract

Despite recent progress made by large language models in code generation, they
still struggle with programs that meet complex requirements. Recent work uti-
lizes plan-and-solve decomposition to decrease the complexity and leverage self-
tests to refine the generated program. Yet, planning deep-inside requirements
in advance can be challenging, and the tests need to be accurate to accomplish
self-improvement. To this end, we propose FUNCODER, a code generation frame-
work incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus.
Specifically, FUNCODER recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals
during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are
then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate
functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior,
mitigating error propagation. FUNCODER outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
+9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4. Moreover, our method demonstrates superiority on smaller models: With
FUNCODER, StableCode3b surpasses GPT-3.5 by +18.6% and achieves 97.7% of
GPT-4’s performance on HumanEval. Further analysis reveals that our proposed
dynamic function decomposition is capable of handling complex requirements, and
the functional consensus prevails over self-testing in correctness evaluation.

Introduction

Over the past few years, large language models have been observed to attain significant advancements
in coding capabilities (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). Meanwhile, models designed specifically
for coding tasks have also been introduced (Rozière et al., 2023; Lozhkov et al., 2024; Pinnaparaju
et al., 2024). Although LLMs can proficiently generate simple code snippets, they suffer from a
decline in performance as code requirements become complicated.

Numerous efforts have been made to tackle this complexity. The two-stage methods (Jiang et al.,
2023; Zelikman et al., 2023) employ the plan-and-solve strategy, which first generates a draft outline

for the complex task and uses it as guidance for implementing the code in the second stage. Multi-
agent development frameworks (Hong et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2023) mimic real-world software
development workflows, assign different roles to LLMs and collaborate to solve a complex goal.
Self-improvement (Shinn et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024), on the other hand, refines the program in
accordance with execution feedback from self-generated unit tests.

Despite fruitful efforts made by the previous methods in dealing with complex problems, certain
challenges still remain unsolved: (1) Two-stage approaches need to design a complete plan at the
beginning and lack the ability to adjust the top-level design during implementation, leading to sub-
optimal decomposition. (2) Multi-agent collaboration frameworks are cumbersome and rely heavily
on LLM capabilities, making them difficult to generalize to smaller open-source models. (3) Code
refinement through self-tests depends on the correctness of generated unit-tests. Our preliminary
study (§3.1.3) finds that models generate unreliable self-tests in abundance. These incorrect tests may
mislead self-improvement and, at worse, exacerbate program errors.

To address these issues, we propose FUNCODER, a code generation framework utilizing a divide-and-
conquer strategy and a novel functional consensus mechanism on functions to decompose complex
problems. Starting from the main problem, FUNCODER introduces new functions to cope with
certain sub-problems. The new functions will be decomposed recursively, eventually forming a tree
of functions. FUNCODER then combines functions bottom-up to achieve increasingly complicated
objectives. By dividing-and-conquering tasks into simpler sub-functions, complexity can be gradually
reduced. However, errors in sub-functions may propagate to the whole program, thereby damaging
overall reliability. We propose functional consensus that samples multiple functions and selects the
one demonstrating consensus, measured by the aggregated similarity among candidates. By reaching
a consensus, we reduce the discrepancies in code behavior and thus alleviate cascading errors.

We conduct extensive experiments on code generation benchmarks (Chen et al., 2021; Austin
et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2023) with GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average. Experiments are further carried out
on the mathematical competition benchmark, MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), achieving a +6.0
improvement with GPT-4, indicating that FUNCODER can also generalize to complex reasoning.
Our method is observed to be equally effective on open-source models (Meta AI, 2024; Mistral AI,
2024; Pinnaparaju et al., 2024; Rozière et al., 2023; Lozhkov et al., 2024), with an average gain over
baseline of +31.5% on HumanEval and +47.7% on MATH. Additional analysis also shows the
advantage of both divide-and-conquer and functional consensus. Our code is made openly available

FUNCODER: Divide-and-Conquer Meets Consensus

2.1
Divide-and-Conquer for Iterative Programming

A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs and outputs where each input is assigned
exactly one output (Halmos, 1998), denoted as y = f(x). In computer programming, a function is
identified by its header hf with its body bf, and is commonly accompanied by a documentation df to
improve readability. Functions can be invoked from other procedures, allowing for the decomposition
of large and complicated requirements into smaller structures that exhibit high comprehensibility
and quality (Dahl et al., 1972). Generally, human programmers tend to decompose tasks into clearly
defined sub-functions and then implement them recursively, making functions eligible for re-usage,
taking advantage of the divide-and-conquer principle. Inspired by this, FUNCODER recursively
divides the requirement and conquers functions to formulate a sophisticated solution, unleashing the
potential of LLMs in code generation.

Divide is a top-down process that iteratively breaks down problems. Given a code generation
problem, the process begins from the entry function froot. We instruct the model to introduce new
functions fi ∈CHILD(fcur) that solve certain sub-goals while writing the current fcur. To reduce the
complexity involved in each generation, we only require the headers hfi and documentation dfi of
new functions to be generated, while their implementations bfi can be postponed. After completing
the current function, the model starts to address those unimplemented sub-functions and complete bfi
into f ′
i. This process stops when the model deems functions too simple to be further divided, finally
forming a dependency tree T = TREE(froot, CHILD(froot)). The divide process is similar to a search
starting from the entry function, gradually involving new sub-functions while writing the current, and
implementing them recursively. We guide the entire process through a depth-first search.

Conquer is a process of achieving complex objectives through aggregating smaller functions. We
notice that child functions are not yet implemented during the top-down process of writing parent
functions. As a result, these parent functions may not be able to effectively utilize the child functions,
or misuse them at worst. FUNCODER deals with this issue by re-generating functions in inverse
topological order on the dependency tree T - starting from leaves, complex goals are handled by
compositing solved children as f ∗
cur ←F(f ′
cur, {f ∗
1 , f ∗
2 , . . . }) | f ∗
i ∈CHILD(fcur).

Divide and conquer naturally achieve both decomposition and composition during code generation.
Unlike two-stage and agent-based methods, our approach dynamically introduces new functions

along the process, making it less burdensome than producing a complete plan at the very beginning.
Moreover, while planning or agents require chat capabilities, FUNCODER represents sub-tasks
through functions (Figure 2), making it more applicable to specialized code generation models.

2.2
Functionality Similarity as a Consensus

The decomposition of complex tasks benefits from solving easier sub-goals, but might introduce
the risks of cascading errors, which refers to errors in sub-functions that lead to errors in ancestral
functions. To mitigate this, we introduce Functional Consensus which aims at reducing inconsistencies
in program behavior. This is achieved by sampling multiple functions and selecting the one that
exhibits consensus, as measured by the aggregated similarity of functionality between candidates,
thus abating outlier functionalities.

Functionality Similarity A program specifies its functionality (or behavior) through the control
flow and logic defined by its code semantics. However, comparing the functionalities between two
programs based on their semantics is somewhat challenging. By decomposing the requirement into
functions, FUNCODER is able to view the function behavior as a black box that maps arguments into
return values. Considering two functions f and g with the same input domain D(f) = D(g), we
define the similarity between them sim(f, g) as the identicalness of outputs when given the same
input values.

sim(f, g) =
Z

x∈D(f)

1 [f(x) = g(x)]

|D(f)|
≈
X

x∈X|X∼D(f)

1 [f(x) = g(x)]

|X|
(1)

The similarity becomes 1 if and only if two functions output consistent values for all inputs: ∀x ∈
D(f) : f(x) = g(x) ⇔sim(f, g) = 1. We notice that the input domain D(f) is unbounded in most
cases, making its measurement barely feasible in practice. Thus, we approximate it by sampling a
subset of possible inputs X ∼D(f) with an LLM.

Consensus is reached by selecting the candidate f ∗holding maximal similarity with others after
sampling multiple function implementations F = {f(i)} for the same requirements.

f ∗= FUNCONSENSUS(F) = arg max
f(i)∈F

X

f(j)∈F \{f(i)}
sim(f(i), f(j))
(2)

By introducing functional consensus, FUNCODER produces functions that are more consistent and
common in functionality, while omitting abnormal samples. The process is applied to not just the final
program, but also to every sub-tree during the bottom-up conquering stage, resulting in step-by-step,
thorough verification from the most fundamental functions all the way up to the whole program.

2.3
FUNCODER is a Function Coder

We design FUNCODER as a procedure that takes a problem in the form of a function signature f(x),
and produces a final solution f ∗(x), as exemplified in Figure 1. Given a problem f(x), FUNCODER
partially implements the function as f ′(x) referring to unimplemented sub-functions g(y) and h(z).
These sub-functions are then fed into FUNCODER to be recursively coped with. We then sample
k implementations f ′
(i)(x) based on solved children g∗(y) and h∗(z). Functional consensus is
calculated by evaluating candidates on possible inputs. The function sharing maximal behavioral
similarity is combined with solved children to formulate the final solution.

Experiments

We conduct experiments on competition-level code generation and mathematical reasoning bench-
marks with state-of-the-art LLMs, which are covered in section §3.1 and §3.2, respectively. In
addition to GPT models (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023), we also conduct experiments with
community models like Llama38b (Meta AI, 2024), StableCode3b (Pinnaparaju et al., 2024), and
CodeLlama34b (Rozière et al., 2023). We use the instruct variant of these models and inference on a
single A100-80G under BF16 precision with vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023).

3.1
Code Generation

We choose three benchmarks for code generation evaluation: (a) HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)
includes entry-level coding questions; (b) MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) contains questions of standard
library invocation and programming basics; and (c) xCodeEval (Khan et al., 2023) consists of
algorithmic challenges sourced from the competitive programming platform CodeForces.

3.1.1
Experiment Setup

Benchmarks We adopt the full test set (164 problems) for HumanEval, and sample 200 for MBPP
and 500 for xCodeEval, respectively. Following EbTech (2024), we split the xCodeEval into 4
subsets based on problem difficulty: Easy (≤1200), Mid (1200-1599), Hard (1600-1999) and Expert
(≥2000). The evaluation metric for code generation is Pass@1 unless specified.

Baselines We compare FUNCODER with standard prompting (Brown et al., 2020), two-stage
decomposition method Parsel (Zelikman et al., 2023), self-testing method CodeT (Chen et al., 2023a),
self-improvement methods Reflexion and LDB (Shinn et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2024), and multi-
agent developing framework MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024). We implement Standard prompting with
a 1-shot demonstration. CodeT samples 11 solutions with standard prompting and evaluates them on
model-generated tests. The results for Reflexion are reproduced from the original code.

Implementation Details FUNCODER uses a 2-shot prompt in the divide stage and 1-shot for
conquering sub-functions. The number of sampled implementations in the functional consensus is set
to 11 for code generation tasks. For further implementation details, please refer to Appendix A.1.

3.1.2
Results

Table 1 shows the code generation performance on advanced proprietary models, GPT-3.5 (Ouyang
et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). For basic programming questions, HumanEval and MBPP,
FUNCODER surpass previous SOTA methods by +3.3% in Pass@1 and reduce the error rate by 18.6%.
Furthermore, FUNCODER demonstrates a substantial improvement on competition-level problems,
outperforming others by 10.4% in GPT-4 and 35.3% with GPT-3.5. We observe that FUNCODER can

enhance LLM’s capability of solving more complex programming tasks, with an average accuracy
improvement of 82.3% over the baseline on the Mid and Hard subsets of xCodeEval. Expert level
programs, however, still remain a colossal challenge for even the most cutting-edge LLMs.

Evaluation is also performed over community LLMs, Llama3 (Meta AI, 2024), StableCode (Pin-
naparaju et al., 2024) and CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023) with results in Table 1. FUNCODER
consistently boosts the performance of smaller models in code generation, demonstrating notable
improvements compared to standard prompting on HumanEval, which gained +29.4% on Llama3,
+32.8% on StableCode, and even +51.5% on CodeLlama, outperforming that from the previous best
method CodeT. We also supplement results on GPT-4o mini, Codestral and StarCoder2 in Table 11.
Experiment results demonstrate that our method archives state-of-the-art performance on various
models, ranging from basic programming to competition contests.

3.1.3
Analysis

FUNCODER Democratize to Smaller LLMs Limited by the LLM capabilities, the application of self-
improvement or multi-agent methods on smaller models is without ease. By keeping decomposition
and composition within the code generation process, our approach exhibits better generalization. As
shown in Table 1, with FUNCODER, StableCode3b achieves around 118.6% relative performance to
standard GPT-3.5, and also aligns closely with GPT-4 by about 97.7% on HumanEval.

Preliminary Study on Self-Testing Method We conduct a preliminary study targeting the self-testing
method on HumanEval, results are shown in Figure 3.a with further details in Appendix A.5. We first
verify whether model-generated programs can also pass model-generated self-tests: (a) If a program
passes self-tests, most from GPT-3.5 would also work on system tests, as much as 19.5%/64% ≈30.5%
programs from StableCode are rejected, indicating that smaller models like StableCode may not
effectively self-test and detect program errors on its own. (b) In the event of failed self-tests, a large
portion of failures are attributed to issues in self-tests instead of the programs, on both GPT-3.5
and StableCode. These phenomena indicate that self-testing methods have limitations in generating
correct and reliable unit tests. As a result, we design functional consensus to not require any assertion,
but perform mutual verification between solutions instead, as opposed to self-testing.

Effectiveness of Functional Consensus Functional consensus or self-testing may be viewed as
ranking algorithms for selecting functions. To measure ranking effectiveness, we conduct an analysis
on HumanEval with GPT-3.5. For each problem, 11 candidates are ranked with 3 strategies: consensus,
self-test, and random shuffle (as a baseline). Effectiveness is measured via Pass@k, i.e. if any of the
top-k ranked programs pass the system test. Figure 3.b shows that functional consensus achieves
94.7% upper bound (Pass@11) performance by selecting a single function (Pass@1), and is close
to that of self-test on Pass@4. This clearly demonstrates that functional consensus can effectively
evaluate correctness and pick the most promising implementation on the first attempt.

Ablation and Token Usage To analyze the impact of dividing, conquering, and functional consensus
in FUNCODER, we carry out an ablation study with different settings. Studies that replace consensus
with self-testing, or with AlphaCode-like (Li et al., 2022) clustering, are also included. The ablation
is constructed on HumanEval with GPT-3.5, as shown in Table 2. Note that to generate every
program FUNCODER costs only O(kN) tokens, where k is the number of sampled candidates,

and N is the token length of the final program. This is further exemplified and explained in
§A.7. We observe that function decomposition and re-composition deliver cumulative performance
improvements. Functional consistency is also shown to prevail over self-testing. Putting them all
together, FUNCODER received a +17.1 improvement with just 5.09× more tokens over baseline.
Compared to previous SOTA LDB (≈23K tokens), we are able to gain +2.5 in performance with
76.5% token usage reduction.

3.2
Mathematical Reasoning

Code can be viewed as a tool for augmenting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Chen et al., 2023b).
Alternative to text-based reasoning like Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), programs can offer
unique advantages in terms of iteration and calculations. To test the generalizability of FUNCODER
beyond algorithm challenges, we conduct an experiment on MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), a
competition-level mathematical reasoning benchmark.

3.2.1
Experiment Setup

Benchmark The experiment is conducted on a subset of the MATH test set, including 500 randomly
sampled problems that can be classified into 7 disjoint subjects or 5 difficulty levels. It can be noticed
that labels in MATH are formatted in LATEX, rendering exact-match verdicts impractical. We, therefore,
follow previous work (Zhang et al., 2024) and adopt GPT-4 to determine the correspondence between
predictions and labels, with further details provided in Appendix A.4.

Baselines We compare FUNCODER with the text-based baselines: Standard Prompting and Chain-
of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), and program-aided baselines: Program-of-Thought (Chen et al.,
2023b), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024). The results of
Cumulative reasoning are reported in the original paper. Standard prompting and chain-of-thought
reasoning use 7-shot demonstrations constructed from the train set. Program-of-Thought and Self-
Refine prompt the model with 1-shot demonstration to generate a solution() function that solves
the problem. Additionally, self-refine iteratively refines programs based on runtime feedback. All
baseline methods are run with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) at 5.

Implementation Details
FUNCODER adopts a program-aided reasoning setting that writes a
solution() function and obtains the final prediction by running this program. The number of
sampled implementations |F| in functional consensus is set to 5 to match baseline methods.

Results

The experimental results on MATH are shown in Table 3. It shows that program-aided reasoning
generally outperforms text-based reasoning. With GPT-4 as the backbone, FUNCODER outperforms
the strongest baseline Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024) by (6.0 / 8.3%) and surpasses the
vanilla program-aided baseline PoT (Chen et al., 2023b) by (10.0 / 14.7%). When using GPT-3.5-
turbo as the backbone, FUNCODER exceeds the strongest baseline by (6.2 / 11.1%) and outperforms
PoT by as much as (13.0 / 31.7%), which indicates that our approach has a strong advantage over
both text-based reasoning and other program-aided reasoning methods.

On open-source models, FUNCODER with Llama3 outperforms PoT by (12.4 / 38.0%). It has even
reached competitive performance against the state-of-the-art method based on GPT-3.5 (45.0 v.s.
48.6). When employing StableCode and CodeLLaMA as the backbone, our approach achieves
significant improvements by (12.2 / 84.7%) and (9.2 / 60.5%), respectively. This improvement
demonstrates that our approach can significantly boost smaller LLMs, democratizing the complex
reasoning capabilities of open-source LLMs through programming.

FUNCODER Can Handle Harder Questions
Figure 4 compares between CoT, PoT, and FUN-
CODER across varying difficulty levels. It illus-
trates that CoT performs comparatively well on
the easiest questions, but suffers from a steep
decline in performance as difficulty increases.
This suggests that text-based reasoning is inad-
equate for tackling challenging mathematical
reasoning problems. The same situation is also
observed in PoT. In contrast, our method consis-
tently demonstrates high performance even on
challenging problems, particularly excelling on
level 5 difficulty with nearly double the perfor-
mance compared to PoT and CoT. This reflects that our method, with divide-and-conquer applied,
can effectively cope with complex problems.

Decomposed Functions are Domain-Specific We hypothesize that questions from the same subject
require similar knowledge reserves, which should be reflected in the functionality of the sub-functions.
To verify this hypothesis, we statisticize the common sub-functions of FUNCODER in each MATH
subject, as shown in Table 4. It is apparent that different subjects require different abilities, each
with its own set of sub-functions closely associated with the domain knowledge. In addition, these
common sub-functions are fundamentally basic and straightforward. As exemplified in Appendix B.2,
our method is able to leverage and combine these basic sub-functions to achieve more complex goals,
thereby reducing the complexity of reasoning and enhancing performance.

Large Language Model for Code Code pre-training has received widespread attention, with early
models based on small language models (SLM) (Feng et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).
In recent years, with the development of large-scale pre-training techniques, code LLM has emerged,
showing remarkable performance in downstream code tasks (Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023;
Li et al., 2022; Rozière et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Guo et al., 2024). Tasks between code and
natural language (NL) can be generally divided into three major categories: NL2Code tasks such as
code generation (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021a; Khan et al., 2023)
and code search (Husain et al., 2019a); Code2Code tasks including code completion (Lu et al., 2021;
Zhang et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024), code translation (Ahmad et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2022; Yan
et al., 2023), and test generation (Siddiq et al., 2023; Schäfer et al., 2024); Code2NL tasks like code
summarization (Husain et al., 2019b; Jin et al., 2023). This paper focuses on code generation tasks,
ranging from basic to competition level.

Code Refinement and Self-Testing Code doesn’t always run as expected; it could contain syntax
errors, dead loops, or bugs. It’s essential to debug and refine the code to ensure better quality.
CodeT (Chen et al., 2023a) generates unit-tests to score the implementation. AlphaCode (Li et al.,
2022) clusters programs based on whether generated program outputs were identical or not. Self-
improvement methods (Madaan et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Zhong et al.,
2024) design closed-loop procedures that repeatedly refine the code based on the feedback. Like
real-life software development processes, multi-agent frameworks (Hong et al., 2024; Qian et al.,
2023) construct specific LLM roles, Tester or QA to generate tests. These studies adopt a shared
paradigm wherein self-tests are generated through LLMs. However, Olausson et al. (2024) points out
the challenge that LLMs have certain shortcomings in self-repairing their code. This paper avoids
these shortcomings by proposing functional consensus as a reliable method of evaluation.

Program-Aided Reasoning and Agents Aside from code generation tasks, the program can be
a tool that augments LLM to solve complex reasoning questions or interact with external environ-
ments. Program-of-Thought (Chen et al., 2023b) and PAL (Gao et al., 2023) prompt the model to
generate a program that solves mathematical or symbolic problems. MathPrompter (Imani et al.,
2023) and Chain-of-Code (Li et al., 2023a) fuse the text-based chain-of-thought with code-based
program-of-thought prompting to complement each other in mathematical reasoning. Cumulative
Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024) conducts bottom-up reasoning to derive the final answer progres-
sively. Numerous work (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) also use code as an
intermediate component to bridge LLM agents with external environments.

Decompose for Complex Problems Several recent works employ decomposition to reduce the
complexity of hard problems. Least-to-Most (Zhou et al., 2023) adopts a two-stage approach, which
first decomposes complex problems, and then solves each sub-problem individually to tackle complex
reasoning tasks. Successive Prompting (Dua et al., 2022) adopts a dynamic decomposition, iteratively
breaking down problems and addressing sub-problems. Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023) breaks
down complex problems into state spaces and uses tree search to solve them. Parsel (Zelikman
et al., 2023) introduces decomposition to code generation tasks, taking a three-stage to break down
requirements into draft and intermediate parsel programs. RepoCoder (Zhang et al., 2023b) performs
a retrieval in repositories to complete unfinished code one by one. Unlike these methods, FUNCODER
recursively decomposes problems into a tree structure, hence gradually reduces its complexity.

Discussion

Limitations Our approach unleashes the potential power of functions in programming, which is
advantageous on well-defined problems such as competitive programming, or program-augmented
reasoning tasks. These scenarios do not however represent all use cases, such as open-ended problems
or casual software development. Nevertheless, we believe that the idea of divide-and-conquer and
sub-modular consensus utilized by FUNCODER can be extended to a wider range of problems, and
we consider this as a future exploration.

Broader Impact While code generation is increasingly utilized in software development, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to generating toxic, vulnerable, or malicious code. Such
programs pose risks and should be used or executed with extra caution.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented FUNCODER, a novel code generation framework that integrates the divide-
and-conquer strategy with functional consensus to address complex requirements. FUNCODER had
demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks
and models. Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of dynamic decomposition and functional
consensus in writing complex code, which suggests that FUNCODER may have the potential to
empower further improvements in code generation and other fields.

Function Header
Declares the function name, arguments, and return type,
and is used as a signature to identify the function in a
program.
df
Function Docstring
(or Documentation)
Provides additional usage details for this function, but is
optional. We encourage the model to generate docstrings
to describe sub-goals precisely.
bf
Function Body
(or Implementation)
The function body contains a subroutine that describes its
control flow and behavior. Functions may be invoked from
within.
f ′(x)
Partially Implemented
A provisional function structure generated by the LLM
where sub-procedures are not yet implemented.
f ∗(x)
Solved Function

(ii) Glossary
System Test
Hidden Test
System testing is a phase where a set of previously invis-
ible test cases are run against the submitted program to
validate if the code is correct and produces the expected
output for different categories of inputs.
Unit Test
Assertion
A unit test is an assertion consisting of given input and
expected output, whereas in Python, it takes the form of
assert func(x) == y.
Self-testing
-
Self-testing is an evaluation process that prompts the
model to generate unit tests (assertions) to assess the cor-
rectness of the generated program.
AlphaCode-like
Clustering
-
AlphaCode proposed a clustering process that elects can-
didate program from a number of samples, recognizing
programs that produce exactly identical outputs as equiva-
lent, and picks one program from the largest cluster.

A.1
Implementation Details

Models
We access the OpenAI models GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613), GPT-4 (gpt-4-1106-preview)
and GPT-4o mini (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) through Azure OpenAI. Weights of community models
Llama3 (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct), Codestral (Codestral-22B-v0.1), StableCode (stable-code-

are downloaded from HuggingFace (Wolf et al., 2019) and served over an OpenAI-like API on a
single A100-80G GPU under BF16 precision with vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023).

Divide
We instruct the model to write the current function and introduce new functions with clearly
defined sub-goals. The prompt C.2 for the divide process includes two examples: one example needs
to involve new functions that are left unimplemented; and another where the sub-goal is simple
enough that no further decomposition is necessary. The model generates a Python code block with
a temperature of 0.2, and the code block will be extracted to represent a tree of functions with new
functions as the children of the current. We require that any new sub-function do not refer to existing
functions, to avoid circular references. This generation process will be attempted at most 3 times
until any valid code with a proper signature is found in the output. FUNCODER then traverses the
function tree via depth-first search and restricts the max depth of the tree to 6.

Conquer
We apply the composition of sub-functions to rewrite the parent function after all sub-
functions have been fully decomposed. Code for sub-functions is made visible to the LLM, which is
requested to rewrite the current function with a 1-shot demonstration (C.3). With functional consensus
applied, the model samples multiple implementations with a temperature of 0.8, and the one that
reaches consensus will be kept for further bottom-up processing.

Functional Consensus
The functional consensus is applied in the conquer stage. Formally, Consen-
sus@k samples k-1 implementations in the conquer stage, and reuses the one produced in the divide
stage, resulting in a set F of k candidate programs. Then we prompt the model with 1-shot (C.4) to
generate potential inputs X for the given function and use them to feed and execute the program.
As described in Eq 2, when two functions output the same value in a given input, they will both
add 1 point to the overall similarity. A thrown exception or timeout during execution assigns -100
points to the candidate as it indicates potentially problematic code. Similar to self-testing methods,
we also leverage the example input/output at the root node to filter out candidates that have wrong
functionality. Finally, the one candidate with maximum scores over all inputs is selected, as it reaches
consensus with other implementations.

Hierarchical Code Interpreter
Divide-and-conquer represents the problem hierarchy through
structured code. To gain insights of this information, we design an interpreter that syntactically parses
the generated output and organizes them into a graph of functions. We are thus able to decompose
complex tasks by representing sub-goals through the connections of multiple functions. LLMs may
produce vulnerable code even if prompted by trusted inputs, making direct execution or eval() on
generated code especially hazardous. Our framework addresses this with the use of a sandboxed
environment to contain untrusted code execution, preventing the LLM from hanging up or even
breaking the system.

A.2
Baseline Details

Standard Prompting conducts one-time generation and directly output the entire code or final
results. In code generation tasks, we use a 1-shot prompting setting with 0.3 temperature. For MATH,
we sample 1 question-answer pair per subject in the train set, resulting in a 7-shot prompt, and run
self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) with consistency@5 and temperature 0.7.

CodeT (Chen et al., 2023a) samples multiple code solutions X and unit-tests Y . A unit test is
an assertion consisting of given input and expected output, whereas in Python it takes the form of
"assert func(x) == y", CodeT then checks the programs over self-tests and divides the functions
into sets; the score of such a set is defined as the number of functions within multiplied by the number
of succeeded tests. Finally, CodeT selects the function with the most agreement (in the biggest set).
Similar to the setting of FUNCODER, we sample 11 candidate solutions with 0.8 temperature.

AlphaCode-like Clustering is introduced with the model AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), and samples
multiple code solutions X. A fine-tuned model is used to generate test inputs upon which programs
are evaluated. Programs are then clustered by whether the outputs are (exactly) identical, in which
the largest group was selected. The final result comes from this largest group, where any result within
would suffice. In our ablation study, we use similar settings to FUNCODER, sampling 11 candidate
solutions with 0.8 temperature and generate sample inputs likewise.

Parsel (Zelikman et al., 2023) consists of three generation stages: high-level sketch, Parsel program,
and final program. The Parsel program is an intermediate representation of code that describes and
organizes program structure. We report the result of HumanEval with GPT-4 from the original paper.

Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) is a closed-loop agent system that generates unit tests and iteratively
refines the program based on the self-test feedback. The results for GPT-4 on HumanEval and MBPP
are reported in the original paper. Based on officially released code3, we test results with GPT-3.5 and
community models under the reflexion strategy with max_iters=2 and Pass@1. For the xCodeEval
benchmark, as it is judged through standard input/output, we wrap the standard input into function
arguments and obtain the return value as the output in the form of "def main(input_str:
str)
-> str", and the sample input/output are also transformed to visible tests for reflexion process.

MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024) employs a multi-agent strategy that assigns roles and encodes human-
like software development procedures. The scripts for reproducing the results were not made public
as of this paper was completed. Therefore, we include the original result for GPT-4 on the HumanEval
dataset under the with feedback setting.

LDB (Zhong et al., 2024) segments programs into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate
variables after each block throughout runtime execution, allowing large language models to verify
the correctness of smaller code units. We adopt the results as-is reported in the paper.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Wei et al., 2022) generates step-by-step reasoning leading to the
final output answer. The solution is formatted in LATEX, and use \boxed to mark the final answer. We
sample 1 shot per subject in the MATH train set, resulting in a 7-shot demonstration, and running
with consistency@5 and a temperature of 0.7.

Program-of-Thought (Chen et al., 2023b) utilizes the coding ability in LLMs to generate programs
rather than text-based solutions for reasoning tasks. In MATH, we hint the model with 1-shot
prompting to generate a solution() function that returns the final answer to the problem. The
program is then executed in a Python environment and obtains the return value. If an exception is
thrown during execution, the model will try to regenerate a new program until it succeeds or reaches
3 attempts. Similar to CoT, Program-of-Thought samples 5 programs at a temperature of 0.7 and
votes the final result.

Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) iteratively prompts the model to give feedback and refine the
generated code based on it. Self-refine does not incorporate self-tests, and the refinement is conducted
solely on model feedback. In our preliminary study on HumanEval, this feedback is weak and cannot
improve performance. However, in MATH, the solution program can be executed without the need
for generated assertions. Thus, we extend the self-refine to capture the runtime error trace as feedback
and refine the code until it can run or exceed 3 retries.

Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024) starts from decomposing the input problem into propo-
sitions and conducts bottom-up reasoning until the final answer can be concluded. The results for
Cumulative Reasoning are reported in the original paper under with code setting.

HumanEval
(Chen et al., 2021) is a hand-crafted programming dataset designed to evaluate a
model’s code generation capability. It consists of 164 instances involving programming skills in
language comprehension, reasoning, algorithms, and simple mathematics. The problem contains 2.8
sample inputs and outputs on average in the function document, which can be leveraged to provide
additional guidance for the LLM to select or self-improve the programs. We conduct experiments on
all 164 instances using accuracy (Pass@1) as the evaluation metric. The details of the Pass@1 metric
are described in Appendix A.4.

MBPP
(Austin et al., 2021) consists of fundamental Python programming problems, with a total of
974 examples covering Python programming basics, standard library usage, and related assessment.
Following Shinn et al. (2023), we adopt the mbpp-typed split from MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023)
and sample 200 instances, using Pass@1 as the metric. The original prompt4 from MBPP includes all
hidden tests in the input problem, which may cause label leakage when using these tests to refine or
select programs. To ensure a fair comparison, MultiPL-E removes the test information in the prompt.

xCodeEval
(Khan et al., 2023) is a competition-level multilingual and multitask benchmark con-
sisting of 17 programming languages. xCodeEval collects 25 million openly available samples
from codeforces.com, a platform for competitive programming. The data we use include problem
descriptions in problem_descriptions.jsonl and system tests from unittest_db.json which
consists of 7,635 competition problems and averaged 51.1 tests per problem. Note that the tests
in xCodeEval are crawled, some of them are incomplete due to the website context limit (they end
with an ellipsis and the further content is missing); we filter out problems having invalid test cases.
Based on the CodeForces Rating (EbTech, 2024), we categorize the problems by their difficulty: Easy
(≤1200), Mid (1200-1599), Hard (1600-1999), and Expert (≥2000). We sample 500 problems
from the full split with the basic filter rule mentioned above, resulting in Table 7. The CodeForces
problem has a different input/output style compared to HumanEval and MBPP; it scans input from
Standard Input and prints the answer to Standard Output. Therefore, we judge the program on system
tests using a CodeForces-style judger and use Pass@1 (the program must pass all system tests) as the
evaluation metric.

MATH
(Hendrycks et al., 2021b) is a challenging competition-level mathematical reasoning dataset,
with problems and solutions formatted in LATEX. It covers seven categories: Prealgebra, Algebra,
Number Theory, Counting & Probability, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus. The
original test set of MATH consists of 5000 samples, and we randomly sampled 500 problems as
shown in Table 7. In addition to text-based reasoning, writing programs is another promising way to
solve mathematical problems. These methods involve writing a main() or solution() function,
and executing the program to obtain the final answer. Through experiments on MATH, we aim to
demonstrate that FUNCODER can enhance LLM’s ability to address complex mathematical problems
through programming.

Metrics

Pass@k
When a program is passed (or accepted), it means that the program must pass all system
tests without errors and within the time limit. In our experiments, we set the time limit to 2.5
seconds. Pass@k judges k independent programs, and if any of them can pass, the result will be 1.

4Original MBPP prompt: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp

19


---Page Break---
In most of our experiments, we use Pass@1 as the metric, as it reflects the accuracy of the method
framework achieved without feedback from humans. Pass@k, on the other hand, is equivalent to
filtering programs through hidden, human-annotated test labels.

EM-GPT
The ground truth label in MATH is written in LATEX, and the accuracy between labels and
model predictions cannot be directly calculated through exact-match (EM). MATH provides a judge
program5 that preprocesses LaTeX syntax and check whether two disambiguated strings are equal.
However, this is insufficient for evaluating LaTeX-formatted labels with variant program outputs. We
follow the evaluation criteria from previous work (Zhang et al., 2024), using GPT-4 to assess the
consistency between predictions and ground truths, with prompt shown in C.6.

Details of Analysis

Details of Preliminary Analysis on Self-testing
(Figure 3.a) The preliminary study is conducted
on the HumanEval dataset, which includes system tests S to evaluate the accuracy of the program, as
well as one human-annotated canonical solution c. For each question, we: (1) Obtain one solution
program p from Standard Prompting. (2) Prompt the model to generate 7 self-tests T based on the
question and entry function. The self-test is in the form of the unit test assert f(x) == y. We
then judge the generated program p and canonical solution c over the self-tests T and system tests S.
Formally, a pair (x, Y ) is used to identify whether program x passes test Y . Where (p, S) indicates
that the program can pass the system tests, demonstrating its correctness. And ¬(c, T) means the
canonical solution can not pass self-tests, suggesting that the tests generated by model could be
wrong. The self-test results on generated programs are first evaluated and divided into two classes:
self-test passed or failed. If the self-test passes, the self-improvement methods will stop iteration and
pick this program as a final result. The next step is to determine whether the program can pass system
tests. If the self-test fails, it indicates that there could be an error in the program or test itself. In this
case, the correctness of the program is checked using final tests (p, S) and the correctness of the unit
test by canonical program (c, T). The results on GPT-3.5 and StableCode are shown in Figure 3 and
detailed explanations about these conditions can be found in Table 8.

Table 8: Explanation on how we classify cases in self-testing preliminary study.

Explanation

self-test

final

(p, T) ∧(p, S)

The self-test result is consistent with the final judge. How-
ever, self-testing methods cannot improve performance
in this case, as the program from the baseline (Standard
Prompt) is already correct.

final

(p, T) ∧¬(p, S)
Self-test is too weak to detect errors in the program, there
could be edge cases that not been considered.

self-test

¬(p, T) ∧¬(p, S) ∧(c, T)
This is a good example that self-testing detects errors
in the program. Feedback from the test will be used to
select or refine the solution.

unit-test
wrong
¬(p, T) ∧(p, S) ∧¬(c, T)
Bad case, the self-test produced an error result and fil-
tered out a correct solution. Continuously revising the
code for this test will lead to a performance downgrade.

both
wrong
¬(p, T) ∧¬(p, S) ∧¬(c, T)
The model is unable to generate a correct solution or test
cases. Refining the program over faulty test samples
will not lead to the correct answer.

-
¬(p, T) ∧(p, S) ∧(c, T)
In the event of self-test failure, there must have been at
least one error in either program or tests, so this condition
should never occur.

Details of Ranking Strategy Comparison
(Figure 3.b) We obtain 11 candidate programs from
FUNCODER on HumanEval with GPT-3.5 and rank them through three strategies. This ensures that
the same candidate set is used for a fair comparison. An effective ranking strategy should prioritize

5math_equivalence: https://github.com/hendrycks/math/blob/main/modeling/math_equivalence.py

20


---Page Break---
placing correct programs at the forefront and filter out those with errors. Thus, we measure the
effectiveness by computing Pass@k results on the top-k-ranked programs selected by each strategy.
The Pass@11 result serves as an upper bound as it uses all programs to compute the pass rate.

How We Count Frequently Used Functions in MATH
(Table 4) In the mathematical reasoning
experiments, we used a subset of 500 items from the MATH test set, with an average of 71.4 questions
per subject. However, it is not very confident to represent common functions from only 71.4 programs.
Therefore, we sample 3000 problems from the MATH test set for this experiment and run the divide-
only setting of FUNCODER on them. Then, the occurrence of sub-functions is counted based on their
names after extracting the function nodes of code trees for each category.

A.6
Detailed Explanation of Algorithm

We hereby provide a detailed explanation of FUNCODER algorithm works, with respect to Algorithm
1 from Figure 2 (a copy is included below for simple reading). As mentioned, FUNCODER is a
recursive process following a DFS pattern. We use square brackets (e.g. [L1]) below to denote line
numbers in the pseudocode.

Example

Figure 5: Left: Algorithm for FUNCODER. Right: Decomposition example of A[B[DE]C].

FUNCODER [L1], when solving each function f, first performs the Divide stage [L3-L9], where
the LLM initially writes the function and identifies some potential sub-problems, represented as
sub-function stubs (e.g., def f(xs:
list[int]) -> int) [L3]. In this process, we identify the
sub-problems of the current problem, thereby understanding the dependency between functions.

For each decomposed sub-problem g1, g2, . . ., we recursively use FUNCODER to obtain the final
implementation Gi for that sub-problem [L5-L8]. This Gi shall replace the previously incomplete
subfunction stub signature in the final program.

Now that all sub-problems of f are implemented, we move on to the Conquer stage [L11-13] to
complete the larger problem. By combining the signature f and the final implementations G1, G2, . . .
of sub-problems, we generate the complete implementation F [L11] and return it [L13].

We hierarchically describe how this algorithm works in detail by combining it with the example given
in the right half of Figure 5.

Token-cost Complexity

Example
We use the example from Figure 5, where the final program consists of 5 functions
A[B[D,E],C], and A serves as the entry to the program. Here we respect the aforementioned
notations, and further use the lower-case letter a to represent the number of stub tokens, upper-case
A to represent the number of result tokens, for the function A, and other functions likewise. Let
N = A + B + C + D + E be the token-cost complexity of the final result.

In Standard, the code is only generated once to complete the given stub. We use parentheses to
represent the order of LLM calls in a full process.

(1)
a -> A B C D E
input tokens
= a
output tokens = A + B + C + D + E
overall
= O(N)

In each step of the FUNCODER/Divide stage, the to-be-implemented function will serve as the context.
The function (stub) will be implemented and sub-function stubs are to be declared.

(1)
a -> A b c
(2)
b -> B d e
(3)
d -> D
(5)
e -> E
(8)
c -> C
input tokens
= a + b + c + d + e
output tokens = A + b + B + c + C + d + D + e + E < 2N
overall
= O(N)

In every FUNCODER/Conquer, the context shall include the current function’s definition and finalized
implementations of sub-functions. The output is the re-implemented current function.

(4)
d -> kD
(6)
e -> kE
(7)
b D E -> kB
(9)
c -> kC
(10)
a B C -> kA
input tokens
= a + b + B + c + C + d + D + e + E < 2N
output tokens = kA + kB + kC + kD + kE = kN
overall
= O(kN)

These stages in all bring FUNCODER’s total token consumption to strictly O(kN) for every problem.

Token Complexity of FUNCODER is O(kN)
Define N as the token length of the final program,
which is correlated to the inherent complexity of the problem, and define k as the number of sampled
candidates. We first explain in detail that the worst-case token cost of FUNCODER is O(kN):

22


---Page Break---
• The naive Standard method should naturally generate O(N) tokens. Sampling-based baselines
like CodeT cost O(kN) tokens.

• FunCoder goes through the Divide stage and the Conquer stage for each of the functions.

• Based on the current function, Divide generates an implementation of itself and stubs for sub-
functions. Within this stage, each function would appear at most once in input and twice in
output. All Divide stages consume no more than 3N tokens.

• Conquer regenerates the parent function based on its stub and all finalized sub-functions. Herein
each function will appear at most twice in input, and sampled k times in output. If k = 1,
consensus is implicitly disabled. All Conquer stages shall consume at most (k + 2)N tokens.

So FunCoder requires no more than (k + 5)N tokens in input-output, making its token consump-
tion O(kN) even at worst-case, aligning with other sampling-based methods such as CodeT and
AlphaCode-like clustering. Furthermore, when sampling is disabled (k = 1), our method has a token
consumption of O(N), which also aligns with the vanilla Standard method.

A.8
Discussion About Functional Consensus

This section focuses on why functional consensus might enhance the correctness of programs and
how it differs from other consistency-based methods. Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) is widely
employed in the realm of LLM reasoning. It samples multiple sets of answers and uses voting to
select the most consistent result, where the answers typically consist of named entities, choice options,
or numbers. However, this approach faces challenges when voting on sampled programs, as programs
describe executable logic instead of data, making it unobvious to determine whether two programs
are equivalent just from the looks.

When it comes to picking programs, functional consensus in FUNCODER looked beyond the literal
symbols and used a different approach. It uses inputs and execution results to compare behavioral
differences among programs. There have been similar methods, such as the strict clustering approach
in AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), which samples a set of program inputs and then clustering programs
with identical outputs into the same group. The final program is then selected from the largest cluster.

However, the idea of grouping programs by the ‘identicalness’ of outputs is not without fallacies,
since programs rarely specialize in solving one single irreducible problem – they deal with a variety of
inputs, conditions and mysterious cases. The result of this, where different solutions could have many
common behaviors and some distinct behaviors, is referred to as the term ‘special-case similarity’
in the FrAngel paper (Shi et al., 2019). We consider a correct program solution which has multiple
‘special-case similar’ programs that are partially correct in different ways, for example:

• One program behaving correctly on the general case (almost all) but missed a few edge cases

• Another program got one edge case correct but didn’t manage to deal with the general case

• Yet another program got all edge cases correct but crashed on the general case

• A buggy program that behaves correctly on all available test cases but none of these tests trigger
the bug (literally test coverage problem)

• And many programs that turn out to be frenzy mixtures of all the above

If we had a pool of programs that contained the fully-correct program and an assortment of other
programs that respected certain cases of the problem as aforementioned, it’d be obvious that the fully-
correct would be decently ‘special-case similar’ to the rest of the programs, for their similar behavior
on inputs. These execution outputs are programmatically obtained and automatically compared
against each other without any human intervention or LLM calling required, the process of which sits
at the core of our functional consensus algorithm.

Therefore, with functional consensus, where the solutions with common behaviors are promoted,
we could intuitively expect the result to be a higher likelihood of a fully-correct program. Provided
below is a hypothetical example demonstrating why functional consensus prevails:

Example
Consider the problem of finding all square roots in the complex domain of a non-zero
real number (stored in float32). To get the answer right for all inputs, the function must consider 2

23


---Page Break---
cases: A) non-zero numbers have 2 square roots; B) square roots of negative numbers are imaginary.
10 candidate functions are sampled as below:

• 5 results (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) only considered case A and got just positive inputs right. For
negative numbers, they literally gave up and crashed.

• 3 results (b6, b7, b8) remembered to consider case B, gave 2 imaginary results for negative
numbers, but forgot to do the same for positive numbers, returning only 1 square root therein.

• Only 2 results (c9, c10) considered all cases and returned correct results for all inputs.

If we pick the program through ‘clustering’, the final result would be one of the 5 results
(a1, a2, . . . , a5) that only considered case A, which is evidently not the correct solution. But with
functional consensus, the final result is vastly different, since we consider the similarity between the
functions based on their behavior on different inputs. Without loss of generality, suppose that there
are 2 test inputs 4.0, −9.0, one for each of the 2 cases. We calculate the similarity as follows:

• Programs ai got only
√

4.0 = [2.0, −2.0] right so each program here are similar with programs
(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, c9, c10), scoring 7 points.

• Since bj only went well with √−9.0 = [3.0i, −3.0i], programs here only score 5 points for case
B with the ones (b6, b7, b8, c9, c10).

• Each program in ck gets 7 points for
√

4.0 with (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, c9, c10), and gets 5 points for
√−9.0 with (b6, b7, b8, c9, c10). Totals to 12 points.

The final result apparently leaned towards ck as the correct solution, even if their outputs as a whole
weren’t even half as much as ai is. Through this example, we illustrate that functional consensus has
the potential to identify the correct samples even at their minority, outperforming other methods such
as self-consistency or clustering.

Full Results for Code Generation
We provide results for all conducted experiments on code
generation benchmarks in Table 11. Our method consistently improves the baseline on community
models by averaging 11% on MBPP and 150% on xCodeEval. It is worth noting that small models
have a tendency to have low pass rates on competition problems, leading to a relatively higher
randomness, therefore we run 3 experiments and report the median result.

Full Results for MATH
The MATH dataset divides the problems into five levels of difficulty.
The difficulty distribution of our test set can be found in Table 7. We report the average accuracy
of FUNCODER and other methods for each math subject in Table 12 and results for each level in
Table 13. The results of Cumulative Reasoning are obtained from the original paper (Zhang et al.,
2024). Experiment results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model’s reasoning
ability across all levels of MATH.

input: standard
input
output: standard
output

## Description

You have two
friends. You want to present
each of them
several
positive
integers. You want to present
cnt1
numbers to the first
friend and cnt2
numbers to the second
friend. Moreover , you want
all
presented
numbers to be distinct , that also
means
that no
number
should be presented to both
friends.In addition , the first
friend
does not like the
numbers
that are
divisible
without
remainder by prime
number x. The second one does not like the
numbers
that are
divisible
without
remainder by prime
number y. Of
course , you 're not going to present
your
friends
numbers
they don
't like.Your task is to find such
minimum
number v, that you can
form
presents
using
numbers
from a set 1,2,...,v. Of course you
may choose not to present
some
numbers at all.A positive
integer
number
greater
than 1 is called
prime if it has no positive
divisors
other
than 1 and itself.

## Input

The only line
contains
four
positive
integers cnt1 , cnt2 , x, y (1<=
cnt1 ,cnt2 <109;
cnt1+cnt2 <=109; 2<=x<y <=3*104) - the
numbers
that
are
described in the
statement. It is guaranteed
that
numbers x, y
are prime.

## Output

Print a single
integer - the answer to the
problem.

## Sample
Input 1

```
3 1 2 3
```

## Sample
Output 1

```
5

## Notes

In the first
sample you give the set of numbers {1,3,5} to the first
friend and the set of numbers
{2} to the second
friend. Note that
if you give set {1, 3, 5} to the first friend , then we cannot
give
any of the
numbers 1, 3, 5 to the second
friend. In the second
sample you give the set of numbers
{3} to the first friend , and
the set of numbers {1, 2, 4} to the second
friend. Thus , the
answer to the
problem is 4.

Mathematical Reasoning

Problem What is the sum of the smallest and second-smallest positive integers a satisfying the
congruence 27a ≡17 (mod 40) ?

Ground Truth: 62

B.2.1
CoT
We can solve for $a$ by multiplying
both
sides of the
congruence by
the
modular
inverse of $27$
modulo
$40$. Since
$27$ and $40$ are
relatively
prime , we know that $27$ has a modular
inverse
modulo
$40$. We can find this
inverse
using the
Euclidean
algorithm:
\begin{align *}
\text{gcd }(40 ,27) &= \text{gcd }(27 ,13)
&= \text{gcd }(13 ,1)
&= 1.
\end{align *}
Therefore , the
modular
inverse of $27$
modulo
$40$
exists. We can find
it using the
Euclidean
algorithm
backwards:
\begin{align *}
1 &= 13 - 3 \cdot 4
&= 13 - 3(40 - 27)
&= 4 \cdot 27 - 3 \cdot 40.
\end{align *}
Thus , the
modular
inverse of $27$
modulo
$40$ is $4$. Multiplying
both
sides of the
congruence
$27a\equiv 17 \pmod {40}$ by $4$ gives
$108a\equiv 68 \pmod {40}$. Simplifying
the left -hand side
gives
$8a\equiv 28 \pmod {40}$. Dividing
both
sides by $4$ gives $2a\
equiv 7 \pmod {10}$. The
smallest
positive
integer
$a$
satisfying
this
congruence is $a=9$, and the second -smallest is $a=19$.
Therefore , the sum of the
smallest
and second -smallest
positive
integers
$a$
satisfying
the
congruence
$27a\equiv 17 \pmod {40}$ is
$9 +19=\ boxed {28}$.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We conduct experiments to reflect the performance of our methods in code
generation (§3.1) and mathematical reasoning (§3.2), we also included analysis and ablation
study in multiple aspects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, please refer to the Limitation paragraph in Discussion (§5).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

40


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include detailed information in the Appendix to support reproducibility,
including method details and the model versions we use (§A.1), baseline settings (§A.2),
dataset information (§A.3), evaluation metrics (§A.4), details of analysis process (§A.4),
complete examples (§B) and prompts (§C).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

41


---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our code is made available at https://github.com/cometeme/funcoder.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, the experimental setting and details can be found in both the main paper
and the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: This paper does not contain error bars or statistical significance analysis.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

42


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the models and compute resources in Appendix A.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: I have checked the Code Of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, please refer to the Broader Impacts paragraph in Discussion (§5).
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

43


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not release new data or models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We reference the code (§A.2), data (§A.3) and models (§A.1) in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

44


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
