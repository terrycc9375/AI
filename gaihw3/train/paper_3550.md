Abstract

Detecting 3D keypoints with semantic consistency is widely used in many sce-
narios such as pose estimation, shape registration and robotics. Currently, most
unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on rigid-body objects. However,
when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve
semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised
keypoint detector Key-Grid for both rigid-body and deformable objects, which
is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder
utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work,
we leverage the identified keypoint information to form a 3D grid feature heatmap
called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel
concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the
3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid
points and the “skeleton” connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate
the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder model. We conduct
an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position
accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to
noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints
though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone.

Introduction

Representing objects through a set of 3D keypoints is one of the most popular and intuitive approaches
to compress and comprehend 3D objects [31; 26]. Effectively exhibiting their utility, 3D keypoints
have contributed to the success of a number of downstream tasks, including pose estimation, shape
registration, object tracking in computer vision [15; 27; 4; 8; 44; 28; 34], as well as various kinds of
robotic manipulation tasks [40; 1; 16].

To make the detected keypoints as capable and accessible as possible, the research community is now
concentrating on the unsupervised learning of semantically consistent keypoints on 3D point clouds.
The implication of semantic consistency is typically twofold: the keypoints should be located at the
semantically salient parts of the objects; they are also desired to be aligned within the same category
even under large shape variations among diverse 3D object instances. To achieve these objectives,
previous works [26; 9; 41; 3; 46] often adopt autoencoder frameworks to facilitate self-supervised
training, where the encoders serving as the keypoint predictor are backbone networks [21; 22]
generalizable to the shape variation, and the decoders reconstruct the input shape conditioned on the
predicted keypoints. Since neural networks are in general better at compression than generation [20],

semantic consistency under: (Top) large intra-category shape variations of rigid-body objects from
the ShapeNetCoreV2 [2] dataset; (Bottom) dramatic deformations of soft-body objects from the
ClothesNet [49] dataset.

the primary challenge of this pipeline lies in reconstructing the entire point cloud from a few estimated
keypoints. Thus, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors [26; 9] lay emphasis on leveraging different
priors on 3D structures (e.g., “skeleton” in Skeleton Merger [26], and “cage” in KeypointDeformer [9])
so that the 3D object shapes can be more reasonably approximated by the information from the
detected keypoints alone.

While maintaining semantic consistency is already demanding under the shape variations of rigid-
body objects (e.g., those in the ShapeNetCoreV2 [2] dataset), it would be even more challenging if
deformable objects are also taken into consideration. For instance, when detecting keypoints on the
trousers, if one detected keypoint is located at one of the trouser legs, then the keypoint is desired to
follow the motion of the trouser leg in the process of the trousers being folded (shown in Figure 1).
Note that the shape variation caused by deformation is so dramatic that even the outline of the object
shape has been completely altered, indicating a shift in the spatial and geometric structure of the
keypoints. Despite the difficulty, with a growing interest in deformable object manipulation [1; 24; 25]
in robotics as well as the emergence of large-scale datasets for deformable objects [49; 6] in computer
vision, it is of increasing significance to develop a keypoint detector that is equally effectively when
faced with deformable objects.

In this work, we present Key-Grid, an unsupervised keypoint detector on 3D point clouds aiming
for semantic consistency under the shape variations of both rigid-body and deformable objects. In
accordance with the prevailing practice, Key-Grid uses an autoencoder framework. In response to
the potentially shifted geometric structure of the keypoints brought by deformations, we propose
to embed the information of the predicted keypoints into a dense 3D feature heatmap. To be more
specific, we first uniformly sample a large number of grid points in the shape of a 3D array. Then, we
assign a feature to each grid by calculating the shortest distance from the grid point to the connected
lines of all the keypoint pairs (i.e., the “skeleton” [26] of the keypoints) and multiplying it by the
weight of the connected lines. Finally, when the decoder attempts to reconstruct the point cloud,
coarse-to-fine features are extracted from the dense grid feature heatmap, where the extracted point
coordinates are in line with the hierarchical point sets in the PointNet++ [22] modules of the encoder.
Intuitively, the grid heatmap can be viewed as a dense extension of the “skeleton” where its undefined
blank spaces are smoothly extrapolated. Functionally, the grid heatmap constitutes a continuous
feature landscape across the entire 3D space, providing richer and more stable geometric descriptions
of the object. This could be vitally beneficial when the object undergoes intense shape variations,
such as cloth deformations.

Empirically, the experimental results show that Key-Grid not only achieves SOTA performance
for rigid-body objects in the popular ShapeNetCoreV2 [2] dataset but also surpasses the previous
SOTA [9] by 8.0% and 9.1% for objects with dropping and dragging deformation respectively in the
recently proposed ClothesNet [49] dataset. Meanwhile, Key-Grid is found to be robust to noise or
downsampling operations. Additionally, we also show that Key-Grid can be easily extended to an
SE(3)-equivariant version when it is integrated with the USEEK [40] framework. We are committed
to releasing the code.

a few datasets contain deformations from the same model. Among them, the deformations from
the same piece of clothing are diverse and have practical research significance. For instance, Deep
Fashion3D [6] contains around 2,000 3D models reconstructed from 563 real garment instances
in different poses. A subset of ClothesNet [49] contains around 3,000 3D garment meshes which
can be directly loaded into differentiable simulations such as DiffclothAI [45] to generate various
deformations after operating like dropping, folding, or dragging.
Unsupervised keypoint detection.
There have been various approaches proposed for supervised
estimation of 3D keypoints using manually annotated keypoints [35; 5; 14; 52; 13; 42]. In contrast to
supervised methods, our approach is unsupervised, meaning it does not rely on manually annotated
keypoints. Thus, we review methods that adopt an unsupervised approach for estimating 3D keypoints.
USIP [12] is the first detector that identifies 3D keypoints in an unsupervised manner by minimizing
the chamfer distance between detected keypoints in randomly transformed object pairs. Canonical
Capsules [29] is a similar approach that feeds pairs of a randomly translated copies of the same
object into a network to detect keypoints. Following USIP, SC3K [51] also uses a random rotation
to create two transformed visions of objects and generate the corresponding keypoints by mapping
the keypoints of each version back to the original object. Another way to estimate 3D keypoints
is proposed by Chen et al. [3]. They encode the point cloud as a set of local feature and input it
into a novel structure model to generate the possibility of keypoints. Recently, Fernandez et al. [11]
proposed a novel method that distinguishes between Node branches and Pose and coefficient branches
to find the optimal keypoints of an object.

However, these methods do not consider the geometric structure information that keypoints can
represent. When they encounter irregular shape of objects, such as airplanes and cars, the keypoints
they identify will lose the crucial information about the object. Skeleton Merger [26] generates the
skeletons of an object connected by keypoints and uses the Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD)
to make these skeletons close to the original point cloud. This makes the detected keypoints to
represent the important structural information of the object. Yuan et al. [46] propose a similar
way that generates keypoints by utilizing skeletons from two objects within the same category to
reconstruct mutually. USEEK [40] utilizes a teacher-student network, where the teacher module is
based on Skeleton Merger and the student module employs a SE(3)-invariant backbone network,
SPRIN [43]. LAKe-Net [32] uses detected keypoints to achieve the shape completion by locating
them to generate a surface skeleton and refining the shape of the object. KeypointNet [30] learns
category-specific 3D keypoints using depth and 2D position information from a pair of 2D images.
For keypoint detection on deformable objects, KeypointDeformer [9] aligns the shape of the source
object to the target object by utilizing the difference in keypoints positions between them and propose
a novel loss function that encourages keypoints to distribute well and keep semantic consistency.

Method

In this section, we propose Key-Grid, an unsupervised keypoint detector on 3D point clouds based on
the autoencoder architecture. Figure 2 shows the overview of Key-Grid. In the following section,
we provide a detailed explanation of the key ingredients in the Key-Grid: an encoder that predicts
keypoint locations in an input point cloud; a grid heatmap is a 3D feature map used to capture the
geometric structure of deformable objects by computing the shortest distance from points uniformly
sampled in 3D cubic space to the “skeleton” generated by keypoint pairs; a decoder that leverages the
grid heatmap and the information in each layer of the encoder to reconstruct point clouds.

3.1
Encoder: Keypoint Detection

In Key-Grid, each keypoint is regarded as the weighted sum of all the points in the point cloud. Given
an input point cloud X ∈RN×3, the goal of the encoder is to produce a weight matrix W ∈RK×N,
such that the matrix multiplication of W and X directly gives the predicted K keypoints K ∈RK×3:

  \ s mall \mathbf {K}=\mathbf {W}\cdot \mathbf {X} 
(1)

To be more specific, the encoder consists of L PointNet++ [22] layers. The i-th PointNet++ layer in
the encoder generates a hierarchically down-sampled point cloud X(i)
enc ∈RN

i×3 and its corresponding
feature F(i)
enc ∈RN

i×F

i, where i ∈{1, 2, ..., L}. The last-layer feature passing through a Softmax
activation function gives the weight matrix:

  \small \math
bf {W}=\mathrm {Softmax}(\mathbf {F}_{\mathrm {enc}}^{(L)})

Figure 2: Pipeline of Key-Grid. In the encoder section, given a point cloud, we detect the keypoints
by utilizing the PointNet++. Then, we utilize the detected keypoints to form the grid heatmap. In the
decoder section, we use each layer of the PointNet++ and the grid heatmap to reconstruct the input
point cloud. “MLP” stands for multi-layer perceptron, which contains Batch-norm and ReLU.

Additionally, following the practice in Skeleton Merger [26], the encoder outputs an additional head
to predict the weights of CK
2 = K(K −1)/2 skeleton segments, i.e., the edges between each pair of
keypoints. Formally, (ki, kj) denotes the skeleton segment connecting the keypoints ki ∈R3 and
kj ∈R3, and sij denotes the weight of the skeleton segment (ki, kj).
3.2
Grid Heatmap: Dense 3D Feature Map
The proposed grid heatmap is a dense 3D feature map designed to densely represent the 3D shape
only through the information from the predicted keypoints. Ideally, for describing the object in
an implicit manner similar to the Occupancy Networks [17], the feature on each grid is desired to
reflect the distance from the grid point to the 3D object shape. Since the ground-truth object shape
is the reconstruction target in our problem setting, we need to find ways to approximate the object
shape using the predicted keypoints. In Key-Grid, we adopt the skeleton [26] approximation, where
the object shape is represented by the weighted connected lines of all the keypoint pairs. For each
individual grid point, we calculate the distances from this point to all the skeleton segments, and
take the maximum of these distances as the feature of this grid. Intuitively, this gives a dense feature
field whose value is the smallest at the geometric center of the object, and gradually increases along
with the grid point coordinate moving outside the outline of the object shape. In the following, we
illustrate the detailed procedures for establishing such a grid heatmap.

To begin with, we uniformly sample a 3D array of grid points P ∈RM×M×M×3 in the normalized
cubic 3D space, where M denotes the number of points we sample on each side of the cube. In
Key-Grid, we set M = 16, giving 4096 gird points. Next, we calculate the distance between the grid
points and all the line segments in the skeleton. When the projection of grid point onto the skeleton
line falls in the range of the skeleton segment, the distance is defined as the distance between the grid
point and the projection point. Otherwise, the distance is directly defined as the distance between the
grid point and the nearest endpoint of the skeleton segment. Formally, the distance dij(p) between a
grid point p ∈R3 and a skeleton segment (ki, kj) connecting the keypoints ki and kj is defined as:

  \sma l

d

_{ i  j}(
\m a t h

eg i n  { a

where

t=\ f rac 
{
\ left (\mathbf {p}-\mathbf {k}_{i}\right ) \cdot \left (\mathbf {k}_{j}-\mathbf {k}_{i}\right )}{\left \|\mathbf {k}_{i}-\mathbf {k}_{j}\right \|_{2}^{2}}\in \mathbb {R} 
(4)

Then, the feature of each grid point D(p) is the maximum of the weighted distances from this point
to all the skeleton segments:

  \s m all
 D
(

where sij refers to the learnable weight of the skeleton segment (ki, kj) produced by the encoder,
and σ is a fixed hyperparameter. And the grid heatmap H is the 3D array consisting of the features of
all the grid points:

  \small \mathbf {H}=\left  (D(\mathbf {P}_{xyz}) \right )_{x,y,z=1,2,...,M}\in \mathbb {R}^{M\times M\times M \times 1}, 
(6)

where Pxyz ∈R3 denotes the extracted grid point coordinate from P indexed by (x, y, z). Concep-
tually, the grid heatmap H contains the complete geometric information of the keypoints K. As a
dense and continuous feature field rather than a set of sparse points, the grid heatmap is expected
to force the encoder to predict precise keypoints and bring benefits to the reconstruction process.

Figure
3:

nition on the
grid heatmap.

In the grid heatmap, we measure the value of D(p) using the maximum point-to-
skeletons distance instead of minimum distance because the maximum distance can
better distinguish the spatial locations, especially what is inside or outside an object.
For instance, Figure 3 shows that if we choose the minimum distance between the
sampled grid points and the keypoints, the grid point p1 inside the pants will have
the same value dmin as the grid point p0 outside the pants. However, if we take the
maximum value dmax, the grid point p1 inside the pants will have a smaller value
than the grid point p0 outside the pants.

3.3
Decoder: Point Could Reconstruction

As an inverse process of the encoder, the decoder tries to reconstruct the entire point
cloud by gradually augmenting finer geometric details in a hierarchical manner.
Unlike previous methods [26; 9] where the keypoint-related 3D structures are used
only once as the input of the encoder, we propose to integrate increasingly finer
grid heatmap features with the layers of the decoder. In addition, the features in the
encoder are directly copied and fused into the corresponding layer in the decoder
in a U-Net [23] fashion to further assist the reconstruction process.

Formally, the feature of the (L −i + 1)-th layer in the decoder is composed by the following three
components:

  \small
 \b

mat h bf {F}_{\ma

(7)

where H(X(i)
enc) ∈RN

i×1 denotes the extracted grid features indexed by X(i)
enc ∈RN

i denotes the corresponding feature of the same number of points copied from the encoder,
Proj(F(L−i)
dec
, X(i−1)
enc
, X(i)
enc) denotes the feature projected from the former layer of the decoder, and
⊕denotes element-wise concatenation. Note that H(X(i)
enc) and F(i)
enc are already aligned on the
first dimension and thus ready for concatenation, the remaining challenge is how to design a feature
projection mechanism Ftarg = Proj(Fori, Xori, Xtarg) so that the former-layer features can be
aligned with the current-layer features.

To solve this problem, we propose to represent the target feature Ftarg as the weighted sum of
the spatially neighboring features in the original feature Fori. More specifically, for every point
coordinate x ∈R3 in the target point cloud Xtarg, we find its Nneig neighbors in the original point
cloud Xori:

  \small \mat h

The target feature of the coordinate x is defined as:

Training Objectives

Our approach adopts an end-to-end method called Key-Grid to identify the keypoints, by leveraging
the grid heatmap to reduce the discrepancy between the reconstructed point cloud and the input point
cloud. In this section, we will introduce two types of loss function to optimize Key-Grid.

5


---Page Break---
Similarity loss.
The common way to evaluate the similarity between a reconstructed point cloud
Xr and a target point cloud X is by employing the Chamfer distance metric [9; 48]. By minimizing
the Chamfer distance between them, we can optimize the reconstruction process to closely match the
target point cloud, thereby achieving a higher level of similarity between the two point clouds. Thus,
we utilize the Chamfer distance between the reconstructed point cloud Xr and the target point cloud
X to approximate this similarity loss Lsim.

Farthest point keypoint loss.
To ensure that the aligned keypoints distribute well on the surface of
objects and represent the geometric structure of objects, we use the farthest point keypoint loss [9]
Lfar to allocate the keypoints. Firstly, we randomly select an initial point from the point cloud X.
Then, at each iteration, it selects the point that is farthest from all the previously selected points. This
process continues until J points have been selected. Finally, we can obtain different sets of sampled
points Q = {q1, q2, · · · , qJ} ∈RJ×3. These sampled farthest points Q are regarded as a prior
estimation of the distribution of keypoints. We define this loss as minimizing the Chamfer Distance
between the predicted keypoints K and the sampled points Q.Our overrall loss function is

  \ma t hcal {L} _ {over} = \alpha _{sim} \mathcal {L}_{sim}+\alpha _{far} \mathcal {L}_{far} \label {eq:overral} 
(11)

where αfar and αsim are scalar loss coefficients.

Experiments

In this section, we compare the performance of Key-Grid over the existing SOTA approaches on both
rigid-body and deformable object datasets. Meanwhile, we conduct the robustness analysis, ablation
studies, and show Key-Grid can be easily extended to an SE(3)-equivariant version.

4.1
Setup
Datasets.
We use the ShapeNetCoreV2 and the ClothesNet datasets [2; 49] to evaluate the
performance of Key-Grid. For the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset [2], it contains 51,300 rigid-body
objects of 55 different categories. In this paper, we only use categories that are manually annotated
with semantic correspondence labels in the KeypointNet dataset [42]. For the ClothesNet dataset [49],
we take three types of deformations on different type of clothing objects: dropping, dragging, and
folding. For each deformation of different garment categories, there are 128 samples during the
deformation process. We test the performance of Key-Grid on real-world 3D scans of clothing from
the Deep Fashion3D V2 dataset [6] and conduct the additional experiments on SUN3D dataset [38]
to further illustrate Key-Grid capability in coping with real and large-scale dataset.

Baselines.
We compare Key-Grid with the current SOTA approaches: KeypointDeformer (KD) [9],
Skeleton Merger (SM) [26] and SC3K [51] that all detect the 3D keypoints in an unsupervised way.
Compared to SM [26], SC3K [51], and Key-Grid, KD [9] not only requires point clouds as input but
relies on object meshes to perform shape transformations from the source shape to the target shape.
Therefore, regarding KD [9] as a baseline is actually unfair to our method. However, since it is the
current SOTA method for keypoint detection on deformable objects, we choose it as a baseline to
compare with our method.

Evaluation metrics.
For the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset [2], we use the Dual Alignment Score
(DAS) [26] to assess the degree of keypoints semantic consistency for each category. Meanwhile, to
verify the accuracy of detected keypoint locations, we compute the mean Intersection over Union
(mIoU) metric [33] with a threshold of 0.1 to evaluate the difference between the detected keypoints
and the ground truth provided by the KeypointNet dataset [42]. For the ClothesNet dataset [49],
due to the absence of manually annotated keypoints, we only use DAS to evaluate the semantic
consistency of keypoint detection on objects with three type of deformations. Higher values for both
metrics correspond to better model performance.

4.2
Results

For the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset [2], we adopt Key-Grid and other baselines to detect ten keypoints
and use the DAS and mIoU to evaluate their performances on the 13 categories of rigid-body
objects in the Table 1. For objects with straight-line geometrical structures such as “Airplane”,
“Vessel”, “Knife”, and “Guitar”, skeletons formed by connecting keypoints easily represent their

geometrical structures, which is why SM outperforms Key-Grid for these categories on the mIoU
metric. However, Key-Grid’s performance on these categories is comparably optimal, achieving
higher average scores for both DAS and mIoU compared to other baselines. Additionally, we
present various supervised networks and self-supervised methods to compare Key-Grid on the
KeypointNet dataset [42] based on mIoU metric in Table 3. Several standard networks, PointNet [21],
SpiderCNN [39], and PointConv [36], are trained to predict keypoint probabilities in a supervised
manner. We can observe that Key-Grid demonstrates superior accuracy in keypoint localization
compared to other self-supervised methods and outperforms some supervised approaches that utilize
PointNet and SpiderCNN as backbones.

Table 4: Comparison of DAS values for Folded Clothes under Normal Placement and SE(3)
Transformation. For deformations with large changes, such as folding, Key-Grid has a more
noticeable advantage whether the clothes are placed normally or undergo SE(3) transformation.

For the ClothesNet dataset [49], we aim to make the eight detected keypoints maintaining semantic
consistency in objects under the deformation process of the same category. Table 2 shows Key-
Grid performs better on the deformations of dropping and dragging than other methods. Key-Grid
outperforms other baselines in the drop deformation for all categories, except for “Tie”, while also
demonstrating superior performance in the drag deformation for all categories, except for “Long
Dress” and “Scarf”. Additionally, we also show the semantic consistency of keypoints identified by
different methods during the folding process of shirts and pants in Table 4. Table 4 illustrates that
for objects with significant deformations, such as folding, Key-Grid significantly outperforms other
methods in terms of keypoint semantic consistency. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the visualization
results of keypoint detection under three deformations of clothing using different methods. In
Figure 4, for the dropping and dragging deformation process on the “Hat” and “Long Pant” categories,
compared to other methods, keypoints identified by Key-Grid distribute evenly on objects and keep
great semantic consistency. The keypoint positions do not change with the deformation of the objects.
In Figure 5(a) and (b), we can observe that when facing folding deformation, keypoints detected by
KD and SM have redundancy phenomenon, which means multiple keypoints are identified at the
same location. Compared to the SC3K method, keypoints identified by Key-Grid not only capture
essential geometric details of deformable objects but also ensure semantic coherence throughout the
folding process. Figure 5(c) shows the grid heatmaps are evidently better at accurately reflecting
the geometric structure of the folded clothes than the skeleton structures proposed in SM. Thus, we
think that precise representation of the object structure using keypoints forces the network to generate
precise keypoints, which makes Key-Grid perform better than previous methods.

For the Deep Fashion3D V2 dataset [6], we select three shirts with different deformations for
keypoint recognition. Key-Grid successfully learns eight semantically consistent 3D keypoints for
these objects, as shown in Figure 5(d), even with obvious deformations in the sleeves of the clothes.
The hyperparameters used in this experiment are consistent with those employed on the ClothesNet
dataset.

For the SUN3D dataset [38], Figure 5(d) presents the visualization results of 20 keypoints on the
different local geometric scenes identified by Key-Grid. Despite the influence of real-distributed noise
and occlusion on keypoint detection results, Key-Grid can still recognize keypoints with important
geometric information in real-level data, such as corners of buildings and center positions of scenes.

Robustness Analysis

In this section, we focus on evaluating the robustness of Key-Grid on the noisy and down-sampled
point clouds of folded shirts. To obtain the noisy point clouds, we add Gaussian noise with varying
variances to the point clouds. And we utilize the Farthest Point Sampling method to downsample the
original point clouds, which has also been used in previous works [19; 47].

Figure 6(a), (b) and (c) show the DAS and visualization results of detected keypoints for the noisy and
down-sampled point clouds. The results indicate that both SC3K and Key-Grid experience a decrease
in DAS as the noise level increases. Meanwhile, when downsampling the original point cloud by a

9


---Page Break---
factor of 16, the DAS of Key-Grid and SC3K will significantly decrease. However, when Key-Grid is
subjected to significant noise interference and high-level downsampling, the DAS of Key-Grid is still
better than SC3K, which has not been subjected to any interference. The visualization results also
show that keypoints detected by Key-Grid exhibit strong robustness even when subjected to Gaussian
noise or downsampling.

Additionally, we also present the visualization of keypoints identified from occluded objects, outlier-
laden objects, and side views of objects under the folding deformation in Figure 6(e). Key-Grid shows
robust performance on both occluded point clouds and those captured from side views. Meanwhile,
even when point clouds contain outliers, keypoints detected by Key-Grid maintain strong semantic
consistency. Thus, we can conclude that Key-Grid effectively identifies keypoints in comparatively
low-quality or partial point clouds, similar to its performance with complete point clouds.

4.4
SE(3)-Equivariant Keypoints

It is significant that Key-Grid is capable of identifying keypoints of objects undergoing SE(3) trans-
formations. We analyze the capability of Key-Grid to identify keypoints of objects undergoing SE(3)
transformations. However, if using a SPRIN module [43] which is a SOTA SE(3)-invariant backbone
to replace PointNet++ [22] directly, the training process of Key-Grid does not converge. Thus, to
achieve Key-Grid to accurately identify the keypoints of objects undergoing SE(3) transformations,
we regard Key-Grid as the teacher network of USEEK [40]. The student network of USEEK is the
SPRIN module. Figure 6(d) shows that the keypoints of folded pants recognized by USEEK are
invariant under an assortment of random SE(3) transformations. We also consider other baselines as
the teacher model of USEEK. Table 4 demonstrates that Key-Grid outperforms other baselines in
terms of identifying the SE(3)-Equivariant keypoints with semantic consistency.

4.5
Ablation Studies

Strategy of decoder.
In the decoder section, Key-Grid combines the information from each layer
of the encoder with the grid heatmap to reconstruct the original point cloud. In order to illustrate
the importance of encoder information and grid heatmap for the reconstruction process, Key-Grid
respectively uses one of these two strategies in the decoder section. Table 5 shows that when using
both input streams to reconstruct the point cloud, the keypoints detected by Key-Grid exhibit better
semantic consistency.

Loss ablation.
To emphasize the importance of each loss, we conduct the evaluation of the proposed
approach by systematically excluding each loss individually. The results are illustrated in Table 5.
We can observe that the DAS of Key-Grid decreases when any of the loss functions is excluded from
the training process. The similarity loss contributes comparatively low, but regardless of whether
Key-Grid is applied on the ClothesNet dataset or the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset, it still can improve the
semantic consistency of the keypoints identified by Key-Grid. The contribution of the farthest point
keypoint loss is comparatively higher than the similarity loss. Without the farthest point keypoint
loss, the DAS of Key-Grid will decrease significantly.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Key-Grid that detects keypoints for both rigid-body and deformable objects.
It uses the detected keypoints to build grid heatmap and incorporate it into the reconstruction process
of point clouds. We evaluate the quality of keypoints on multiple datasets and analyze the robustness
of Key-Grid. Meanwhile, we embed the Key-Grid into the USEEK framework to produce SE(3)-
equivariant keypoints. Extensive experiments shows that Key-Grid can detect the keypoints with
great semantic consistency and precise location.

Appendix Materials

A
Implementation Details

We use the PyTorch framework [7] to train our method. The entire network is optimized on the Adam
optimizer [10] with a learning rate of 0.1. For all the experiments, the batch size is set to 8. Our
method is trained for 100 epochs, and for the first 20 epochs of training, we do not use a similarity
loss function which measures the similarity between the reconstructed point clouds and the original
point clouds.

For all the experiments, the input point cloud contains N = 2048 points. The number of encoder
layers L in the PointNet++ network [22] is 4. For the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset [2], we set the number
of keypoints K to be 10. Thus, when calculating the farthest point keypoint loss function, we choose
the number of the farthest points J as 14. For the ClothesNet [49] and Deep Fash 3D dataset [6], we
set K and J as 8 and 12, respectively. The hyperparameter K and J are 20 and 24 in the SUN3D
dataset [38]. In the process of building the grid heatmap, the number of points M uniformly selected
on each edge of the cubic space is 16. For the decoder, the hyperparameter Nneig for the number of
neighboring features applied in aligning the feature from the former layer to the current layer is set to
3. In the loss function, αfar and αsim are both set to 1.

Efficiency of Key-Grid

Table 6 presents the time and memory consumption of Key-Grid and SM when inferring a batch
comprising 32 samples on a single 1080 Ti GPU. According to Table 6, Key-Grid achieves equal
efficiency to the baseline method (SM) in terms of inference speed but consumes an acceptably larger
memory size.

Visualization Results

In this section, we primarily present additional visualization results about the experimental part to
illustrate the effectiveness of Key-Grid.

Number of keypoints.
We vary the number of unsupervised keypoints discovered by Key-Grid
on the folded pants. Figure 7 shows that these different numbers of keypoints on the folded pants
maintain good semantic consistency during the deformation process. And as the number of keypoints
increases, we find that these keypoints do not overlap with each other, they still evenly distribute on
the surface of the objects, and each keypoint represents the geometric information of the objects.

Ablation study.
We show the visualization results of the ablation study in Figure 8. From the
Figure 8, we find that in the decoder section, if we only use the encoder information or the grid
heatmap information to reconstruct the original point cloud, the positions of the keypoints on the
folded pants are not stable. When we do not use the similarity loss function in the decoder section,
the keypoints will be placed in the wrong prior positions and the network predicts the redundant
keypoints. Moreover, when we do not apply the farthest point keypoint loss function to train the
network, the performance of keypoint recognition will be poor, as the keypoints will cluster around
the center of the object.

Gaussian noise to point cloud.
Figure 9 shows the visualization results of Key-Grid for different
noisy point clouds, which add the Gaussian noise of different scales to the input point cloud. We can
observe that even when Gaussian noise is added to the original point cloud with a magnitude of 0.08,

numbers (6, 8, 10, 12) of keypoints on the folded pants, respectively.

the positions of the keypoints detected by Key-Grid in these noisy point clouds are still close to those
found in the original point cloud. Thus, we can conclude that Key-Grid exhibits robustness when
dealing with the noisy point clouds.

Downsampling point cloud.
This paragraph presents the performance of Key-Grid on the down-
sampled point clouds shown in Figure 10. For decimating the original point cloud, we use the Farthest
Point Sampling method for downsampling. We discover that Key-Grid successfully estimate the
keypoints on the downsampled point clouds. When downsampling the original point cloud by a factor
of 16, resulting in a point cloud with 128 sample points, except for the blue keypoints which will be
shifted downwards, the positions of the other keypoints will remain close to their positions detected
in the original point cloud.

Deep Fash3D V2 dataset.
We show the additional visualization results of keypoints detected by
Key-Grid on the Deep Fash3D V2 dataset [6]. Figure 13 illustrates that when faced with a wider
variety of clothing cuff deformations, the keypoints detected by Key-Grid achieves great semantic
consistency on the world scanned objects and represents the important information about these objects.
Thus, we think that Key-Grid performs well in the world scanned objects.

ShapeNetCoreV2 and ClothesNet dataset.
For ShapeNetCoreV2 [2] and ClothesNet [49] dataset,
we present the visualization results of keypoint recognition in a wider range of object categories using
SM and Key-Grid. In Figure 12, we separately present the visualization results of keypoint recognition
on the ShapeNetCoreV2 dataset using SM and Key-Grid. Compared to the redundancy phenomenon
that many keypoints locate in the same region generated by SM [26], the keypoints detected by
Key-Grid distribute separately on the surface of the object, and these keypoints also can represent the
important geometric information of the object. For the ClothesNet dataset, Figure 13 demonstrates
the keypoint detection of SM [26] and Key-Grid in the deformation process of a wider range of object
categories, including drop and drag deformations. In the deformation process, compared to SM [26],

noise added underneath each noisy point cloud. “Noise 0.00” is the original point cloud.

the keypoints identified by our method keep good semantic consistency and distribute evenly on
the surface of the object. Thus, for the rigid-body and deformable objects, Key-Grid exhibits great
performance on keypoint detection.

Video Results

In the supplementary materials, we also provide keypoint recognition results for the folding clothes
in the ClothesNet dataset using different methods. The video we provide include the entire process
of deformation for shirts and pants. From this video, we can conclude that Key-Grid identifies the
keypoints that maintain good semantic consistency during the deformation process. These keypoints
also carry the geometric feature information of the deformable objects.

Limitation and Social Imapct

Following previous works, we need to manually set the total number of predicted keypoints before-
hand. In future research, we will propose an adaptive keypoint detection method that can generate
varying numbers of keypoints with accurate positions for different samples. Key-Grid predicts the
keypoints on the publicly available datasets. Thus, we think Key-Grid has very limited potential
negative societal impacts.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction section include the contributions and scope of
the study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the appendix, we describe the limitations of our study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: Our article does not involve theoretical proofs and results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the experimental section, we disclose the datasets required for our study
and provide the hyperparameters required for each dataset in the appendix, to facilitate the
reproducibility of our experimental results for the readers.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

21


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release the code to facilitate the reproducibility of our work for the readers.
The code is already provided in the supplementary materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We disclose the necessary details required for the experiments in both the
experimental section and the appendix to assist readers in understanding our experimental
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We do not repeat the error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the appendix, we discuss the memory usage and inference time of our
method.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer:[Yes]

Justification: Our paper discusses societal impacts in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

23


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not have such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
