Abstract

Unconditional generation—the problem of modeling data distribution without re-
lying on human-annotated labels—is a long-standing and fundamental challenge
in generative models, creating a potential of learning from large-scale unlabeled
data. In the literature, the generation quality of an unconditional method has
been much worse than that of its conditional counterpart. This gap can be at-
tributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work,
we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in
the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These represen-
tations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called
Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to
the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehen-
sive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional gen-
eration quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet
256×256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%. Our un-
conditional results are situated in the same tier as the leading class-conditional
ones. We hope these encouraging observations will attract the community’s atten-
tion to the fundamental problem of unconditional generation. Code is available at

Introduction

Generative models have been long developed as unsupervised learning methods in the history, e.g.,
in the seminal works including GAN [27], VAE [39], and diffusion models [57]. These fundamental
methods focus on learning the probabilistic distributions of data, without relying on the availabil-
ity of human annotations. This problem, often categorized as unconditional generation in today’s
community, is in pursuit of utilizing the vast abundance of unannotated data to learn complex distri-
butions.

However, unconditional image generation has been largely stagnant in comparison with its condi-
tional counterpart. Recent research [18, 54, 10, 11, 24, 50] has demonstrated compelling image
generation quality when conditioned on class labels or text descriptions provided by humans, but its
quality degrades significantly without these conditions. Closing the gap between unconditional and
conditional generation is a challenging and scientifically valuable problem: it is a necessary step
towards unleashing the power of large-scale unannotated data, which is a common goal in today’s
deep learning community.

We hypothesize that such a performance gap is because human-annotated conditioning introduces
rich semantic information to simplify the generative process. In this work, we largely close this
gap by taking inspiration from a closely related area—unsupervised/self-supervised learning.1 We

1In this paper, the term of “unsupervised learning” implies “not using human supervision”. Thus, we view
self-supervised learning as a form of unsupervised learning. The distinction between these two terminologies
is beyond the scope of this work.

Figure 1: The Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG) framework for unconditional
generation. RCG consists of three parts: (a) it uses a pre-trained self-supervised encoder to map
the image distribution to a representation distribution; (b) it learns a representation generator that
samples from a noise distribution and generates a representation subject to the representation distri-
bution; (c) it learns an image generator (e.g., which can be ADM [18], DiT [50], or MAGE [41]) that
maps a noise distribution to the image distribution conditioned on the representation distribution.

observe that the representations produced by a strong self-supervised encoder (e.g., [30, 12, 8, 14])
can also capture a lot of semantic attributes without human supervision, as reflected by their transfer
learning performance in the literature. These self-supervised representations can serve as a form
of conditioning without violating the unsupervised nature of unconditional generation, creating an
opportunity to get rid of the heavy reliance on human-annotated labels.

Based on this observation, we propose to first unconditionally generate a self-supervised represen-
tation and then condition on this representation to generate the images. As a preprocessing step
(Figure 1a), we use a pre-trained self-supervised encoder (e.g., MoCo [14]) to map the image dis-
tribution into the corresponding representation distribution. In this representation space, we train
a representation generator without any conditioning (Figure 1b). As this space is low-dimensional
and compact [65], learning the representation distribution is favorably feasible with unconditional
generation. In practice, we implement it as a very lightweight diffusion model. Given this represen-
tation space, we train a second generator that is conditioned on these representations and produces
images (Figure 1c). This image generator can conceptually be any image generation model. The
overall framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides a new paradigm
for unconditional generation.2

RCG is conceptually simple, flexible, yet highly effective for unconditional generation. RCG greatly
improves unconditional generation quality regardless of the specific choice of the image generator
(Figure 2), reducing FID by 71%, 76%, 82%, and 51% for LDM-8, ADM, DiT-XL/2, and MAGE-L,
respectively. This indicates that RCG largely reduces the reliance of current generative models on

unconditional generation solution.

Regardless of the specific form of the image generator (LDM [54], ADM [18], DiT [50], or MAGE
[41]), RCG massively improves the unconditional generation quality. Generation quality is mea-
sured by FID on ImageNet with a 256×256 resolution. All comparisons between models without

2.15 FID for unconditional generation. This performance not only largely outperforms previous
unconditional methods, but more surprisingly, can catch up with the strong leading methods that
are conditional on class labels. We hope our method and encouraging results will rekindle the
community’s interest in the fundamental problem of unconditional generation.

Related Work

Generative Models. Generative models aim at accurately modeling data distribution to generate
new data point that resembles the original data. One stream of generative models is built on top
of generative adversarial networks (GANs) [27, 69, 37, 70, 7]. Another stream is based on a two-
stage scheme [63, 53, 10, 67, 40, 41, 11]: first tokenize the image into a latent space and then apply
maximum likelihood estimation and sampling in the token space. Diffusion models [33, 59, 18, 54,
52] have also achieved superior results on image synthesis.

The design of a generative model is mostly orthogonal to how it is conditioned. However, literature
has shown that unconditional generation often significantly lags behind conditional generation under
the same design[18, 41, 10], especially on complex data distributions.

Unconditional Generation. Unconditional generation is the fundamental problem in the realm of
generative models. It aims to model the data distribution without relying on human annotations,
highlighted by seminal works of GAN [27], VAE [39], and diffusion models [57]. It has demon-
strated impressive performance in modeling simple image distributions such as scenes or human
faces [23, 10, 18, 54], and has also been successful in applications beyond images where human
annotation is challenging or impossible, such as novel molecular design [66, 28, 26], medical image
synthesis [71, 16, 47], and audio generation [48, 42, 25]. However, recent research in this domain
has been limited, largely due to the notable gap between conditional and unconditional generation
capabilities of recent generative models on complex data distributions [46, 18, 19, 41, 3, 61].

Prior efforts to narrow this gap mainly group images into clusters in the representation space and
use the cluster indices as underlying class labels to provide conditioning [46, 43, 3, 35]. However,
these methods assume that the dataset is clusterable, and the optimal number of clusters is close to
the number of classes. Additionally, these methods fall short of generating diverse representations—
they are unable to produce different representations within the same cluster or underlying class.

Representations for Image Generation. Prior works have explored the effectiveness of exploiting
representations for image generation. DALL-E 2 [52], a text-conditional image generation model,
first converts text prompts into image embeddings, and then uses these embeddings as the conditions

to generate images. In contrast, RCG for the first time demonstrates the possibility of directly gener-
ating image representations from scratch, a necessary step to enable conditioning on self-supervised
representations in unconditional image generation. Another work, DiffAE [51], trains an image en-
coder in an end-to-end manner with a diffusion model as decoder, aiming to learn a meaningful and
decodable image representation. However, its semantic representation ability is still limited (e.g.,
compared to self-supervised models like MoCo [14], DINO [8]), which largely hinders its perfor-
mance in unconditional generation. Another relevant line of work is retrieval-augmented generative
models [5, 4, 9], where images are generated based on representations extracted from existing im-
ages. Such semi-parametric methods heavily rely on ground-truth images to provide representations
during generation, a requirement that is impractical in many generative applications.

Method

Directly modeling a complex high-dimensional image distribution is a challenging task. RCG de-
composes it into two much simpler sub-tasks: first modeling the distribution of a compact low-
dimensional representation, and then modeling the image distribution conditioned on this represen-
tation distribution. Figure 1 illustrates the idea. Next, we describe RCG and its extensions in detail.

3.1
The RCG Framework

RCG comprises three key components: a pre-trained self-supervised image encoder, a representation
generator, and an image generator. Each component’s design is elaborated below:

Distribution Mapping. RCG employs an off-the-shelf image encoder to convert the image distribu-
tion to a representation distribution. This image encoder has been pre-trained using self-supervised
contrastive learning methods, such as MoCo v3 [14], on ImageNet. This approach regularizes the
representations on a hyper-sphere while achieving state-of-the-art performance in representation
learning. The resulting distribution is characterized by two essential properties: it is simple enough
to be modeled effectively by an unconditional representation generator, and it is rich in high-level
semantic content, which is crucial for guiding image generation. These attributes are vital for the
effectiveness of the following two components.

Figure 4: Representation generator’s
backbone architecture. Each “Layer”
consists of a LayerNorm layer [1], a
SiLU layer [22], and a linear layer.
The backbone consists of an input layer
that projects the representation to hid-
den dimension C, followed by N fully-
connected (fc) blocks, and an output
layer that projects the hidden latent back
to the original representation dimen-
sion. The diffusion timestep is embed-
ded and added to every fc block.

Representation Generation. In this stage, we want to generate abstract, unstructured represen-
tations without conditions. To address this issue, we develop a diffusion model for unconditional
representation generation, which we call a representation diffusion model (RDM). RDM employs a
fully-connected network with multiple fully-connected residual blocks as its backbone (Figure 4).
Each block consists of an input layer, a timestep embedding projection layer, and an output layer,
where each layer consists of a LayerNorm [1], a SiLU [22], and a linear layer. Such an architecture
is simply controlled by two parameters: the number of blocks, N, and the hidden dimension, C.

RDM follows DDIM [58] for training and inference. As shown in Figure 3a, during training, image
representation z0 is mixed with standard Gaussian noise variable ϵ: zt = √αtz0 + √1 −αtϵ. The
RDM backbone is then trained to denoise zt back to z0. During inference, RDM generates represen-
tations from Gaussian noise following the DDIM sampling process [58]. Since RDM operates on
highly compacted representations, it brings marginal computation overheads for both training and
generation (Appendix B.1), while providing substantial semantic information for the image genera-
tor, introduced next.

Image Generation. The image generator in RCG crafts images conditioned on self-supervised
representations. Conceptually, such an image generator can be any modern conditional image gen-
erative model by substituting its original conditioning (e.g., class label or text) with representations.
In Figure 3b, we take MAGE [41], a parallel decoding generative model as an example. The image
generator is trained to reconstruct the original image from a masked version of the image, condi-
tioned on the representation of the same image. During inference, the image generator generates
images from a fully masked image, conditioned on the representation generated by the representa-
tion generator.

We experiment with four representative generative models: ADM [18], LDM [54], and DiT [50] are
diffusion-based frameworks, and MAGE [41] is a parallel decoding framework. Our experiments
show that all four generative models achieve much better performance when conditioned on high-
level self-supervised representations (Table 1).

3.2
Extensions

Our RCG framework can easily be extended to support guidance even in the absence of labels, and
to support conditional generation when desired. We introduce these extensions as follows.

Enabling Guidance in Unconditional Generation. In class-conditional generation, the presence
of labels allows not only for class conditioning but can also provides additional “guidance” in the
generative process. This mechanism is often implemented through classifier-free guidance in class-
conditional generation methods [32, 54, 11, 50]. In RCG, the representation-conditioning behavior
enables us to also benefit from such guidance, even in the absence of labels.

Specifically, RCG follows [32, 11] to incorporate guidance into its MAGE generator. During train-
ing, the MAGE generator is trained with a 10% probability of not being conditioned on image
representations, analogous to [32] which has a 10% probability of not being conditioned on labels.
For each inference step, the MAGE generator produces a representation-conditioned logit, lc, and

an unconditional logit, lu, for each masked token. The final logits, lg, are calculated by adjusting
lc away from lu by the guidance scale, τ: lg = lc + τ(lc −lu). The MAGE generator then uses lg
to sample the remaining masked tokens. Additional implementation details of RCG’s guidance are
provided in Appendix A.

Simple Extension to Class-conditional Generation. RCG seamlessly enables conditional image
generation by training a task-specific conditional RDM. Specifically, a class embedding is integrated
into each fully-connected block of the RDM, in addition to the timestep embedding. This enables the
generation of class-specific representations. The image generator then crafts the image conditioned
on the generated representation. As shown in Table 3 and Appendix C, this simple modification
allows users to specify the class of the generated image while keeping RCG’s superior generative
performance, all without the need to retrain the image generator.

Experiments

We evaluate RCG on the ImageNet 256×256 dataset [17], which is a common benchmark for image
generation and is especially challenging for unconditional generation. Unless otherwise specified,
we do not use ImageNet labels in any of the experiments. We generate 50K images and report
the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [31] and Inception Score (IS) [55] as the standard metrics for
assessing the fidelity and diversity of the generated images. Evaluations of precision and recall are
included in Appendix B.1. Unless otherwise specified, we follow the evaluation suite provided by
ADM [18]. All ablations and results on other datasets are included in Appendix B.1.

4.1
Observations

We extensively evaluate the performance of RCG with various image generators and compare it
to the results of state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional image generation methods. Several
intriguing properties are observed.

RCG significantly improves the unconditional generation performance of current generative
models. In Table 1, we evaluate the proposed RCG framework using different image generators.
The results demonstrate that conditioning on generated representations substantially improves the
performance of all image generators in unconditional generation. Specifically, it reduces the FID
for unconditional LDM-8, ADM, DiT-XL/2, MAGE-B, and MAGE-L by 71%, 76%, 82%, 54%,
and 51%, respectively. We further show that such improvement is also universal across different
datasets, as demonstrated by the results on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist in Appendix B.1. These find-
ings confirm that RCG markedly boosts the performance of current generative models in uncondi-
tional generation, significantly reducing their reliance on human-annotated labels.

Moreover, such outstanding performance can be achieved with lower training cost compared to cur-
rent generative models. In Figure 5, we compare the training cost and unconditional generation FIDs

of RCG and current generative models. RCG achieves a significantly lower FID with less training
cost than current generative models. Specifically, MAGE-B with RCG achieves an unconditional
generation FID of 4.87 in less than a day when trained on 64 V100 GPUs. This demonstrates that
decomposing the complex tasks of unconditional generation into much simpler sub-tasks can signif-
icantly simplify the data modeling process.

RCG largely improves the state-of-the-art in unconditional image generation. In Table 2, we
compare MAGE with RCG and previous state-of-the-art methods in unconditional image generation.
As shown in Figure 8 and Table 2, RCG can generate images with both high fidelity and diversity,
achieving an FID of 3.44 and an Inception Score of 186.9. These results are further enhanced with
the guided version of RCG (RCG-G), which reaches an FID of 2.15 and an Inception Score of 253.4,
significantly surpassing previous methods of unconditional image generation.

RCG’s unconditional generation performance rivals leading methods in class-conditional im-
age generation. In Table 3, we perform a system-level comparison between the unconditional
RCG and state-of-the-art class-conditional image generation methods. MAGE-L with RCG is com-
parable to leading class-conditional methods, with and without guidance. These results demonstrate
that RCG, for the first time, improves the performance of unconditional image generation on com-
plex data distributions to the same level as that of state-of-the-art class-conditional generation meth-
ods, effectively bridging the historical gap between class-conditional and unconditional generation.

In Table 4, we further conduct an apple-to-apple comparison between the class-conditional versions
of LDM-8, ADM, and DiT-XL/2 and their unconditional counterparts using RCG. Surprisingly,
with RCG, these generative models consistently outperform their class-conditional versions by a
noticeable margin. This demonstrates that the rich semantic information from the unconditionally
generated representations can guide the generative process even more effectively than class labels.

As shown in Table 3 and Appendix C, RCG also supports class-conditional generation with a simple
extension. Our representation diffusion model can easily adapt to class-conditional representation
generation, thereby enabling RCG to also adeptly perform class-conditional image generation. This
result demonstrates the effectiveness of RCG in leveraging its superior unconditional generation
performance to benefit downstream conditional generation tasks.

Importantly, such an adaptation does not require retraining the representation-conditioned image
generator. For any new conditioning, only the lightweight representation generator needs to be re-
trained. This potentially enables pre-training of the self-supervised encoder and image generator on
large-scale unlabeled datasets, and task-specific training of conditional representation generator on a
small-scale labeled dataset. We believe that this property, similar to self-supervised learning, allows
RCG to both benefit from large unlabeled datasets and adapt to various downstream generative tasks
with minimal overheads. We leave the exploration on this direction to future work.

generative capabilities. Figure 8 illustrates RCG’s unconditional image generation results on Ima-
geNet 256×256. The model is capable of generating both diverse and high-quality images without
relying on human annotations. The high-level semantic diversity in RCG’s generation stems from

its representation generator, which models the distribution of representations and samples them with
varied semantics. By conditioning on these representations, the complex data distribution is broken
down into simpler, representation-conditioned sub-distributions. This decomposition significantly
simplifies the task for the image generator, leading to the production of high-quality images.

Besides high-quality generation, the image generator can also introduce significant low-level diver-
sity in the generative process. Figure 6 illustrates RCG’s ability to generate diverse images that
semantically align with each other, given the same representation from the reference image. The
images generated by RCG can capture the semantic essence of the reference images while differing
in specific details. This result highlights RCG’s capability to leverage semantic information in rep-
resentations to guide the generative process, without compromising the diversity that is important in
unconditional image generation.

Figure 7 further showcases RCG’s semantic interpolation ability, demonstrating that the represen-
tation space is semantically smooth. By leveraging RCG’s dependency on representations, we can
semantically transition between two images by linearly interpolating their respective representations.
The interpolated images remain realistic across varying interpolation rates, and their semantic con-
tents smoothly transition from one image to another. For example, interpolating between an image
of “Tibetan mastiff” and an image of “wool” could generate a novel image featuring a dog wearing
a woolen sweater. This also highlights RCG’s potential in manipulating image semantics within a
low-dimensional representation space, offering new possibilities to control image generation.

Discussion

Computer vision has entered a new era where learning from extensive, unlabeled datasets is becom-
ing increasingly common. Despite this trend, the training of image generation models still mostly re-
lies on labeled datasets, which could be attributed to the large performance gap between conditional
and unconditional image generation. Our paper addresses this issue by exploring Representation-
Conditioned Generation, which we propose as a nexus between conditional and unconditional image
generation. We demonstrate that the long-standing performance gap can be effectively bridged by
generating images conditioned on self-supervised representations and leveraging a representation
generator to model and sample from this representation space. We believe this approach has the
potential to liberate image generation from the constraints of human annotations, enabling it to fully
harness the vast amounts of unlabeled data and even generalize to modalities that are beyond the
scope of human annotation capabilities.

Implementation Details

In this section, we describe the implementation details of RCG, including hyper-parameters, model
architecture, and training paradigm. We also include a copy of our code in the supplementary mate-
rial. All codes and pre-trained model weights will be made publicly available.

Image Encoder. We use Vision Transformers (ViTs) [20] pre-trained with MoCo v3 [14] as the
default image encoder. We evaluate three ViT variants (ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L) in the main paper,
each trained on ImageNet for 300 epochs. We utilize the image representation after the MLP projec-
tion head, favoring its adjustable dimensionality. An output dimension of 256 has proven the most
effective. The representation of each image is normalized by its own mean and variance. Detailed
training recipes of our pre-trained image encoder can be found in [14].

Representation Diffusion Model (RDM). Our RDM architecture employs a backbone of multiple
fully connected blocks. We use 12 blocks and maintain a consistent hidden dimension of 1536
across the network. The timestep t is discretized into 1000 values, each embedded into a 256-
dimensional vector. For class-conditional RDM, we embed each class label into a 512-dimensional
vector. Both timestep and class label embeddings are projected to 1536 dimensions using different
linear projection layers in each block. Detailed hyper-parameters for RDM’s training and generation
can be found in Table 5.

Image Generator. We experiment with ADM [18], LDM [54], DiT [50], and MAGE [41] as the im-
age generator. For representation-conditioned ADM, LDM and DiT, we substitute the original class
embedding conditioning with the image representation. We follow ADM’s original training recipe to
train representation-conditioned ADM for 400 epochs. We follow LDM-8’s original training recipe,
with modifications including a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 6.4e-5, and a training duration
of 40 epochs. We follow the DiT training scheme in [15], which trains DiT-XL for 400 epochs with
batch size 2048 and a linear learning rate warmup for 100 epochs. The β2 of the AdamW optimizer
is set to 0.95. For representation-conditioned MAGE, we replace the default “fake” class token
embedding [C0] with the image representation for conditioning.

During the training of RCG’s image generator, the image is resized so that the smaller side is of
length 256, and then randomly flipped and cropped to 256×256. The input to the SSL encoder is
further resized to 224×224 to be compatible with its positional embedding size. Our implementation
of guidance follows Muse [11], incorporating a linear guidance scale scheduling. Detailed hyper-
parameters for our representation-conditioned MAGE are provided in Table 6.

Ablations

This section provides a comprehensive ablation study of the three core components of RCG. Our
default setup uses MoCo v3 ViT-B as the pre-trained image encoder, an RDM with a 12-block,
1536-hidden-dimension backbone trained for 100 epochs, and a MAGE-B image generator trained
for 200 epochs. Unless otherwise specified, all other properties and modules are set to the default
settings during each component’s individual ablation. The FID in this section is evaluated against
the ImageNet validation set.

Distribution Mapping. Table 7 ablates the image encoder. Table 7a compares image encoders
trained via various self-supervised learning methods (MoCo v3, DINO, and iBOT), highlighting

their substantial improvements over the unconditional baseline. Additionally, an encoder trained
with DeiT [62] in a supervised manner also exhibits impressive performance, indicating RCG’s
adaptability to both supervised and self-supervised pre-training approaches.

We also notice that using representations from MoCo v3 achieves better FID than using representa-
tions from DINO/iBOT. This is likely because only MoCo v3 uses an InfoNCE loss. Literature has
shown that optimizing InfoNCE loss can maximize uniformity and preserve maximal information in
the representation. The more information in the representation, the more guidance it can provide for
the image generator, leading to better and more diverse generation. To demonstrate this, we com-
pute the uniformity loss on representations [65]. Lower uniformity loss indicates higher uniformity
and more information in the representation. The uniformity loss of representations from MoCo v3,
DINO, and iBOT is -3.94, -3.60, and -3.55, respectively, which aligns well with their generation
performance.

Table 7b assesses the impact of model size on the pre-trained encoder. Larger models with better
linear probing accuracy consistently enhance generation performance, although a smaller ViT-S
model still achieves decent results.

We further analyze the effect of image representation dimensionality, using MoCo v3 ViT-B models
trained with different output dimensions from their projection head. Table 7c shows that neither
excessively low nor high-dimensional representations are ideal – too low dimensions lose vital image
information, while too high dimensions pose challenges for the representation generator.

Representation Generation. Table 8 ablates the representation diffusion model and its effectiveness
in modeling representation distribution. The RDM’s depth and width are controlled by the number
of fc blocks and hidden dimensions. Table 8a and Table 8b ablate these parameters, indicating an

optimal balance at 12 blocks and 1536 hidden dimensions. Further, Table 8c and Table 8d suggest
that RDM’s performance saturates at 200 training epochs and 250 diffusion steps.

Besides evaluating FID and IS on generated images, we also assess the Frechet Distance (FD) [21]
between the generated representations and the ground-truth representations. A smaller FD indicates
that the distribution of generated representations more closely resembles the ground-truth distri-
bution. Since the MoCo v3 encoder is trained on the ImageNet training set, the representation
distribution in the training set can be slightly different from that in the validation set. To establish
a better reference point, we compute the FD between 50K randomly sampled representations from
the training set and the representations from the entire training set, which should serve as the lower
bound of the FD for our representation generator. The result is an FD of 0.38, demonstrating that our
representation generator (with an FD of 0.48) can accurately model the representation distribution.

We also evaluate the representation generator against the validation set, resulting in an FD of 2.73.
As a reference point, the FD between 50K randomly sampled representations from the training set
and the validation set is 2.47, which is also close to the FD of our representation generator.

Image Generation. Table 9 ablates RCG’s image generator. Table 9a experiments with MAGE-
B under different conditioning.
MAGE-B with RCG significantly surpasses the unconditional
and clustering-based baselines, and further outperforms the class-conditional baseline in FID. This
shows that representations could provide rich semantic information to guide the generative process.
It is also quite close to the “upper bound” which is conditioned on oracle representations from Im-
ageNet real images, demonstrating the effectiveness of the representation generator in producing
realistic representations.

We also ablate the training epochs of the image generator and the guidance scale τ, as shown in
Table 9b and Table 9c. Training MAGE longer keeps improving the generation performance, and
τ = 6 achieves the best FID and IS.

B.2
Other Datasets

In this section, we evaluate RCG on datasets other than ImageNet to validate its consistent effective-
ness across different datasets. We select CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist 2021 [64]. CIFAR-10 represents
a relatively simple and low-dimensional image distribution, and iNaturalist 2021 represents a more
complex image distribution, with 10,000 classes and 2.7 million images. For CIFAR-10, we employ
SimCLR [13] trained on CIFAR-10 as the image encoder and Improved DDPM [49] as the image
generator. The FID is evaluated between 50,000 generated images and the CIFAR-10 training set.
For iNaturalist, we employ MoCo v3 ViT-B trained on ImageNet as the image encoder and MAGE-B
as the image generator. The FID is evaluated between 100,000 generated images and the iNaturalist
validation set, which also consists of 100,000 images.

As shown in Table 10, RCG consistently enhances unconditional image generation performance
on both CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist 2021, demonstrating its universal effectiveness across various
datasets. Notably, the improvement on complex data distributions such as ImageNet and iNaturalist
is more significant than on simpler data distributions such as CIFAR-10. This is because RCG de-
composes a complex data distribution into two relatively simpler distributions: the representation
distribution and the data distribution conditioned on the representation distribution. Such decompo-
sition is particularly effective on complex data distributions, such as natural images, paving the way
for generative models to model unlabeled complex data distributions.

B.3
Computational Cost

In Table 11, we present a detailed evaluation of RCG’s computational cost, including the number of
parameters, training costs, and generation throughput. The training cost of all image generators is
measured using a cluster of 64 V100 GPUs. The training cost of RDM is measured using 1 V100
GPU, divided by 64. The generation throughput is measured on a single V100 GPU. As LDM and
ADM measure their generation throughput on a single NVIDIA A100 [54], we convert it to V100
throughput by assuming a ×2.2 speedup of A100 vs V100 [56].

As shown in the Table 11, RCG requires significantly lower training costs to achieve great per-
formance. For instance, it achieves an FID of 4.87 in less than one day of training. Moreover, the
training and inference costs of the representation generator are marginal compared to those of the im-
age generator. This efficiency potentially enables for lightweight adaptation to various downstream
generative tasks by training only the representation generator on small-scale labeled datasets.

B.4
Precision and Recall

In Table 12, we report the unconditional generation precision and recall of RCG, evaluated on Im-
ageNet 256×256 following the ADM suite [18]. Larger models as well as incorporating guidance
(RCG-G) both improve recall while slightly decreases precision.

C
Additional Qualitative Results

We include more qualitative results, including class-unconditional image generation (Figure 9),
class-conditional image generation (Figure 10 and Figure 11), and the comparison between gen-
eration results with or without guidance (Figure 13). All these results demonstrate RCG’s superior
performance in image generation. We also include some failure cases in Figure 12.

D
Limitations and Negative Impact

Limitations. Like any other generative models, RCG can also produce unrealistic or low-quality
results (see Appendix C for some examples).

Societal Impact. Despite the rapid advancements in generative models, they also carry potential
negative societal impacts. For instance, such models can amplify existing biases present in internet
data. RCG, being a generative model, is not immune to these issues. However, it is important to
note that RCG operates within an unconditional generation framework, which does not depend on
human-provided labels. This characteristic might possess the potential to mitigate the influence of
human biases, offering a more neutral approach to data generation compared to traditional condi-
tional models.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This paper presents an unconditional image generation method that rivals the
performance of the state-of-the-art class-conditional generation methods.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these
goals are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means
that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The au-
thors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what
the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the ap-
proach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to ad-
dress problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical contribution.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo-
rems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a
short proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple-
mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu-
sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps
taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture
fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation,
it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with
the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data
is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via
detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in
the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means
that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all sub-
missions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear
how to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to re-
produce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to
construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case au-
thors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

24


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code is available at https://github.com/LTH14/rcg.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of
detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropri-
ate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Following common practice in the generative modeling literature, we do not
report error bars in this paper because of the heavy computation overheads.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

25


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer-
ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of
Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See subsection B.3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments
that didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: see Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact spe-
cific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

26


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitiga-
tion strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will require the users to adhere to usage guidelines for our released mod-
els.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by re-
quiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or
implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We properly cite the original assets in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the li-
cense of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

27


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can
either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the pa-
per include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable,
as well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should
be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, cura-
tion, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the
data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equiva-
lent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval,
you should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity
(if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
