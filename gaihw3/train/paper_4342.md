Abstract

We present Fantasy, an efficient text-to-image generation model marrying the
1

decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer-based masked im-
2

age modeling (MIM). While diffusion models are currently in a leading position in
3

this task, we demonstrate that with appropriate training strategies and high-quality
4

data, MIM can also achieve comparable performance. By incorporating pre-trained
5

decoder-only LLMs as the text encoder, we observe a significant improvement in
6

text fidelity compared to the widely used CLIP text encoder, enhancing the text-
7

image alignment. Our training approach involves two stages: 1) large-scale concept
8

alignment pre-training, and 2) fine-tuning with high-quality instruction-image data.
9

Evaluations on FID, HPSv2 benchmarks, and human feedback demonstrate the
10

competitive performance of Fantasy against state-of-the-art diffusion and autore-
11

gressive models.

Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models [3, 5, 12]
14

have become focal points within the computer vision field.
15

Most advances in T2I models, focused on generating high-
16

quality images based on relatively short descriptions, strug-
17

gle with intricate long-text semantic alignment due to in-
18

herent structure constraints and data limitations. Text
19

encoders used for T2I fall into three categories: CLIP
20

[30], encoder-decoder LLMs, and decoder-only LLMs.
21

Models using encoder-decoder LLMs like T5-XXL [31]
22

have shown improved text-image alignment over CLIP
23

by exploiting enhanced text understanding, increasing to-
24

ken capacity, yet without delving into the semantic align-
25

ment for longer texts. ParaDiffusion [43] indicates that
26

directly aligning text embeddings with visual features with-
27

out prior image-text knowledge is not the most effective
28

approach. Previous works [38, 45] have highlighted short-
29

comings in existing text-image datasets [37], including
30

image-text mismatches, a lack of informative content, and
31

a pronounced long-tail effect. These deficiencies notably
32

impair training efficiency for T2I models and restrict their
33

ability to learn complex semantic alignment.
34

Existing diffusion-based T2I models [33, 5, 9, 26] have achieved unprecedented quality. However,
35

as detailed in Fig. 1, these advanced models come with significant computational demands. The

considerable expenses of these models create significant barriers for researchers and entrepreneurs.
37

Meanwhile, economical text-to-image models [25, 15, 48] compromise on image quality, yielding
38

lower resolution and diminished aesthetic appeal.
39

Given these challenges, a pivotal question arises: Can we develop a resource-efficient, high-quality
40

image generator for long instructions? In this paper, we present Fantasy, significantly reducing
41

training demands while maintaining the capability of instruction understanding and competitive
42

image generation quality, as shown in Fig. 2. To achieve this, we propose three core designs:
43

Efficient T2I netwrok. To leverage the powerful understanding ability of a decoder-only LLM,
44

we choose the lightweight Phi-2 [24] as our text encoder. We derive discrete image tokens from a
45

pre-trained VQGAN [27], and employ Transformer-based masked image modeling (MIM) as our T2I
46

architecture. We also utilize the pre-trained VQGAN decoder [27] for pixel space restoration.
47

Hierarchical Training strategy. We propose a thoughtfully two-stage training strategy to address the
48

high computational demands of current leading models while maintaining competitive performance:
49

(1) large-scale concept alignment pre-training, (2) high-quality instruction-image fine-tuning. To
50

facilitate a coarse image-text alignment, we initially train the T2I model from scratch using relatively
51

lower-quality data. We then fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model and LLM on text-image pair data
52

rich in information density with superior aesthetic quality.
53

High-quality data. To achieve rough alignment while pre-training, we select the large-scale dataset
54

LAION-2B [37] and employ the filtering strategy proposed by DataComp [14]. We collect long-
55

text prompts and corresponding high-quality synthesized images for instruction tuning, including
56

DiffusionDB [42] and JourneyDB [39]. We further filter and discard texts with special characters and
57

data containing violence or pornography, retaining only instructions exceeding 30 words.
58

Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
59

1. We present Fantasy, a novel framework that is the first to integrate a lightweight decoder-only
60

LLM and a Transformer-based MIM for text-to-image synthesis, allowing for long-form
61

text alignment.
62

2. We show that our two-stage training strategy with high-quality data enables MIM to achieve
63

comparable performance at a significantly reduced training cost.
64

3. We provide comprehensive validation of the model’s efficacy based on automated metrics
65

and human feedback for visual appeal and text faithfulness.

Method
67

2.1
Problem Formulation
68

As depicted in Fig. 3, Fantasy consists of a pre-trained text encoder T , a transformer-based masked
69

image generator G, a sampler S, a frozen VQGAN, and a pre-trained super-resolution model. T
70

maps a text prompt t to a continuous embedding space. G processes a text embedding e to generate
71

logits l for the visual token sequence. S draws a sequence of visual tokens v from logits via iterative
72

decoding [4], which runs N steps of inference conditioned on the text embeddings e and visual tokens
73

decoded from previous steps. Finally, D maps the sequence of discrete tokens to pixel space Z. To
74

summarize, given a text prompt t, an image ˆx is synthesized as follows:
75

ˆx = D(S(G, T (t))),
ln = G(vn, T (t)),
vn = M(E(x))
(1)

where n is the synthesis step, and ln are logits, from which the next set of visual tokens vn+1 are
76

sampled. M denotes the masking operator that applies masks to the token in vn. We refer to [4, 3]
77

for details on the iterative decoding process. The Phi-2 [24] for T and VQGAN [8] for encoder E and
78

decoder D are used. G is trained on a large text-image pairs D using masked visual token modeling
79

loss:
80

L = E(x,t)∼D [CE (lN, E(x))] ,
(2)
where CE is a weighted cross-entropy calculated by summing only over the unmasked tokens.
81

2.2
Model Architecture
82

2.2.1
VQGAN as Image Processor
83

VQGAN [8] is capable of transforming each image into discrete tokens with higher-level semantic
84

information from a learned codebook, while ignoring low level noise. The autoregressive tokens
85

prediction of VQGAN shares the same form as text tokens generated by LLMs. Prior research [46]
86

has shown that unifying vision and language by the same token space could enhance the coherency
87

for vision-text alignment. Furthermore, compared with RGB pixels, the visual token representation
88

has proven to reduce disk storage and improve the capability of robustness and generalization.
89

To reduce the computational burden, we initially compress an RGB image v ∈RH×W ×3 into a
90

diminished representation with a resolution of h × w × 3, where h = H/f and w = W/f, with
91

f denoting the downsampling factor. We then employ a pre-trained f16 VQGAN [27] encoder E
92

to quantizate images x ∈R3×256×256 into discrete tokens of spatial dimensions 16 × 16 from a
93

pre-trained codebook Z = {zk}K
k=1 consisting of K = 8192 vectors, resulting in the quantized
94

representation z = E(x, Z).
95

2.2.2
LLM as Text Encoder
96

Recent studies [10, 5, 3] tend to use encoder-decoder LLMs [31] for text encoding over CLIP [30],
97

which is adept at handling tasks that involve complex mappings between input and output sequences.
98

Due to the tremendous success of ChatGPT, attention has been drawn to models that consist solely of a
99

decoder. Also, [43] presents an insight that efficiently fine-tuning a more powerful decoder-only LLM
100

can yield stronger performance in long-text alignment. Consequently, to capitalize on the enhanced
101

semantic comprehension and generalization potential of LLMs while simultaneously reducing the
102

training burden, we employ Phi-2 [24], a state-of-the-art, lightweight LLM, as the text encoder.
103

Given the text prompt t, Fantasy first passes it through Phi-2, extracting the text embedding from the
104

last hidden layer L. However, typically, decoder-only architectures are not adept at feature extraction
105

and mapping tasks. [23] proposes that the conceptual representations learned by LLM’s are roughly
106

linearly mappable to those learned by models trained on vision tasks. Therefore, the embedding
107

vectors are linearly projected to the hidden size of the image generator G:
108

c = P(TL(t))
(3)

where T (·) denotes the decoder-only Phi-2 and L is the index of the last hidden layer. P represents
109

the projection from text space to visual space, and c is the text feature suitable for the image generator.
110

2.2.3
MIM as Image Generator
111

MIM narrows the gap between its modeling and the extensively studied area of language modeling,
112

making it straightforward to leverage the findings of the LLMs research community. Therefore, we
113

adopt a masked transformer as the image generator backbone of Fantasy [46].
114

During training, we leave the projected text embeddings c unmasked and the image tokens z are
115

masked at a variable masking rate based on a Cosine scheduling M as [4, 3]. Specifically, for
116

each training example, we sample a masking rate r from [0, 1] from a truncated arccos distribution
117

with density function p(r) = 2

π(1 −r2)−1

2 . While autoregressive methods learn fixed-order token
118

distributions P(zi|z<i), random masking with variable ratios enables learning P(zi|z̸=i) for any
119

token subset, crucial for our parallel sampling scheme. The sampling of a new state sn+1 at each
120

successive step is conditioned on the previous state and the specified text condition c:
121

P(s | c) =
Z
P(sN | sN−1, c)

N−1
Y

n=1
P(sn | sn−1, c) ds1 . . . dsN−1
(4)

For each training example, the most confidently predicted tokens are revealed at each step n, main-
122

taining cos
  n

N · π


masked until reaching N total steps.
123

For the base model, we use a variant of MaskGiT [4], a masked image generative Transformer to
124

predict randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. Leveraging the multi-layered
125

structure of the Transformer, we have developed scalable image generators with varying layer counts,
126

ranging in size from 257M parameters to 611M parameters (for the image generator; the Phi-2 model
127

has an additional 2.7B parameters). We first employ a series of Cross Attention blocks to optimize
128

text-driven feature extraction, before passing through O layers of the masked image generator. Each
129

layer o of the Transformer is again formed by Multi-Head Self-Attentuib(MSA), LayerNorm (LN),
130

Cross Attention (CA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) blocks:
131

Yo = MSA(LN(Zo)),
Zo+1 = MLP(CA((LN(Yo), c))).
(5)

At the output layer, to reduce the training burden, ConvMLP [18] is utilized to transform masked
132

image embeddings into logits sets, aligning with the VQGAN codebook dimensions. Eventually, the
133

reconstructed lower-resolution tokens are restored with the pre-trained 256 × 256 resolution VQGAN
134

decoder to the pixel space, resulting in the generated image ˆx:
135

ˆx = D(ConvMLP(ZO), Z)
(6)

2.3
Training Strategy
136

Fig. 3 illustrates Fantasy’s two-stage training approach. Following prior works[43, 35, 9], we employ
137

large-scale pre-training to achieve general text-image concept alignment, and simultaneous fine-tuning
138

of Phi-2 [24] and the masked image generator using high-quality instruction-image pairs.
139

---Page Break---
Pre-training Stage.
To perform general text-image concept alignment, the VQGAN and LLM
140

weights are frozen, and only the image generator is pre-trained on deduplicated LAION-2B [37]
141

with images above a 4.5 aesthetic score. We exclusively preserve prompts in English, filter out
142

images above a 50% watermark probability or above a 45% NSFW probability, yielding a final set
143

of 9 million images. Since the computational cost of upsampling is much lower than training a
144

super-resolution model, Fantasy is started with training at a resolution of 256 × 256. Note that the
145

pre-training only needs approximate image-text alignment, substantially lowering the training costs.
146

Fine-tuning Stage.
[43] has proven that LLMs trained solely on text data lack prior image-text
147

knowledge, and that merely aligning their text embeddings with visual features might not be optimal.
148

Therefore, in the second stage, we gather an internal dataset of 7 million high-quality instruction-
149

image pairs to fine-tune both the Phi-2 model and the image generator of Fantasy, which ensures
150

enhanced compatibility of text embeddings within the text-image pair space, facilitating the use of
151

decoder-only LLMs in text-to-image generation tasks and harnessing their inherent advantages. To
152

prevent catastrophic forgetting in LLMs and preserve their understanding abilities during training, we
153

select questions from BIG-bench [2] and monitor the common sense question-answering ability of
154

Phi-2 in real-time throughout the training process. We construct our training dataset for the fine-tuning
155

stage by incorporating JourneyDB [39] and an internal synthetic dataset to enhance the aesthetic
156

quality of generated images beyond realistic photographs. To facilitate instruction-image alignment
157

learning, we retain only data with descriptions exceeding 30 words, as these provide enough detailed
158

insights into the image objects, including attributes and spatial relations.
159

With this approach, Fantasy trains a 0.6B parameter T2I model in about 69 A100 GPU days,
160

significantly reducing computation compared to existing diffusion-based methods, while maintaining
161

comparable visual and numerical fidelity. Throughout this paper, we present a comprehensive
162

evaluation of Fantasy’s efficacy, showcasing the potential in training high-quality transformer-based
163

image synthesis models compared to diffusion-based models in future.
164

2.4
High-quality Data Collection
165

To ensure rough alignment in the pre-training phase, we utilize the large-scale dataset LAION-2B
166

[37] and apply the filtering strategy developed by DataComp [14]. Furthermore, we gather long-
167

text prompts and corresponding high-quality images to achieve finer-grained text-image alignment
168

through instruction tuning. CapsFusion [47] employs a fine-tuned LLaMA [40] for recaptioning
169

LAION-2B [37] and LAION-COCO [1]. However, this approach still results in suboptimal image
170

quality and occasional mismatches between images and text. SAM-LLAVA [5] utilizes LLaVA [20]
171

to recaption the SAM dataset [17], which leads to images with blurred faces, a consequence of the
172

dataset’s inherent face-blurring. Therefore, we shift focus to synthesize images, mainly including
173

DiffusionDB [42] and JourneyDB [39], produced by Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, respectively.
174

To augment the diversity of the images, we minimize the use of datasets from specific domains, such
175

as gaming and anime. Furthermore, we implement filtering to discard texts with special characters
176

and data containing violence or pornography, retaining only instructions exceeding 30 words.
177

Experiments

In this section, we outline detailed training, inference, and evaluation protocols, followed by compre-
179

hensive comparisons across three key metrics.

Training Details.
Different from the prior works [9, 43, 32, 34], we used a lightweight but powerful
182

decoder-only large language model Phi-2 [24] as the text encoder. Diverging from prior approaches
183

that extract a standard and fixed short text tokens, we extend the extraction to 256 tokens to master
184

long-term instruction-image alignment, ensuring precise alignment for more fine-grained prompts.
185

For the entire training process, we train Fantasy on 4×A100 80G GPUs and set the accumulation
186

step to 2. At different stages, we employ varying learning rate strategies with single-cycle cosine
187

annealing decay. Furthermore, the AdamW optimizer [22] is utilized with a weight decay of 0.01.
188

Fantasy trains a 0.6B parameter T2I model in about 84.5 A100 GPU days, significantly reducing
189

computation compared to existing diffusion-based methods as shown in Fig. 1.

Inference Details.
We use N = 32 sampling steps in all of our evaluation experiments. Since
191

Fantasy is trained at a resolution of 256 × 256, we employ the pre-trained diffusion-based super-
192

resolution model StableSR [41] to upscale images to 512 × 512.
193

Evaluation Metrics.
We comprehensively evaluate Fantasy via four primary metrics, i.e., alignment
194

on HPSv2 [44], FID [16] on MSCOCO dataset [19] and human evaluation on a collected dataset.
195

3.2
Performance Comparisons and Analysis
196

Results on HPSv2.
We utilize HPSv2 [44] as our primary automated metric, a preference prediction
197

model which can be used to compare images generated with the same prompt across five categories:
198

anime, concept art, paintings, photography, and DrawBench [36]. We present the results of HPSv2
199

between Fantasy and other state-of-the-art generative models in Tab. 1. Fantasy exhibited outstanding
200

performance across all key aspects among previous Transformer-based methods like CogView2
201

[12], which is expected. The results also reveal its competitive performance compared to prior
202

diffusion-based methods, especially in concept-art and painting, demonstrating similar performance
203

to DALL·E 2 [26]. This remarkable performance is primarily attributed to the text-image alignment
204

learning in fine-tuning stage, where high-quality text-image pairs were leveraged to achieve superior
205

alignment capabilities. In comparison, DeepFloyd-XL and other diffusion-based models achieve
206

better scores, while utilizing larger models with significantly higher compute budget.
207

Results on FID.
We employ FID [16] to evaluate our models on COCO-30K [19]. To allow for
208

a fair comparison, all images are downsampled to 256 × 256 pixels. The comparison between our
209

method and other methods in FID, and their training time is summarized in Tab. 2. We observe
210

that the FID of Fantasy is substantially higher compared to other state-of-the-art models. Visual
211

inspections reveal that images generated by Fantasy are smoother than those from other leading T2I
212

models. This discrepancy is most noticeable in real-world images like COCO, on which we compute
213

the FID-metric. Although the state-of-the-art models [43, 11, 29] exhibit lower FID, it relies on
214

unaffordable resources. Furthermore, prior studies [29, 5, 11] have demonstrated that FID may not

be an appropriate metric for image quality evaluation, as a lower score does not necessarily reflect
216

superior image generation, and it is more authoritative to use the evaluation of human users.
217

3.3
Results on Human Evaluation
218

Following prior works [5, 43, 28], we also conduct a study with human participants to supplement
219

our evaluation and provide a more intuitive assessment of Fantasy’s performance. Participants are
220

asked to select a preference of the images based on the visual appeal of the generated images and the
221

precision of alignments between the text prompts and the corresponding images.
222

As involving human evaluators can be time-consuming, we choose the top-performing open-source
223

diffusion-based models (e.g., SD XL [33], and Pixart-α [5]) and transformer-based models (e.g.,
224

VQGAN+CLIP [8] and CogView2 [12]) as our baseline, which are accessible through APIs and
225

capable of generating images. We randomly select a total of 600 prompts from existing prompt
226

sets (e.g., ParaPrompt [43], ViLG-300 [13], COCO Captions [6]). To comprehensively contrast the
227

capabilities of Fantasy and other models in interpreting text prompts of varying lengths, we allocate
228

one subset to consist of 300 prompts ranging from 10 to 30 characters and another subset comprising
229

300 prompts exceeding 30 characters. For each model, we use a consistent set to generate images,
230

which are then evaluated by 50 individuals.
231

Fig. 4a clearly demonstrates that images generated on relatively long text prompts (longer than 30
232

words) by Fantasy are distinctly favored among the four models in both two perspective, especially
233

for text-image alignment, aligning closely with the intended use case of Fantasy. As illustrated
234

in Fig. 4b, for text prompts shorter than 30 words, our model outperforms existing open-source
235

Transformer-based models in fidelity and alignment for shorter prompts. Our model slightly lags
236

behind diffusion-based models in visual appeal, limited by the 8,192 size of VQGAN’s codebook
237

and not targeting visual appeal. Simultaneously, Fantasy lacks a distinct advantage in text-image
238

alignment in the short subset. We hypothesize that this is due to two main reasons: diffusion-
239

based models’ ability to handle shorter prompts, and vague prompts generating diverse images that
240

make preferences more subjective, thus biasing outcomes towards aesthetically superior images. In
241

summary, the human preference experiments confirm the observation made in the HPSv2 benchmarks.

The hierarchical structure of the Transformer allows us
273

to train image generators with varying numbers of Trans-
274

former layers. As shown in Tab. 4, we evaluate models
275

of different sizes on the HPSv2 benchmark. The insight
276

indicates that as trainable parameters increase from 257
277

million to 611 million, performance consistently improves.
278

Therefore, we set the number of Transformer layers to 22
279

with 611 million trainable parameters as the optimal set-
280

ting. Tab. 5 showcases the required resources for models
281

of three different scales. Fig. 7 offers visual comparisons
282

across models of varying scales, illustrating a clear trend:
283

models with fewer parameters underperform on the HPSv2
284

benchmark, frequently resulting in distorted images and
285

omitted details, yet they may still generate acceptable
286

outcomes. Significantly, the visual quality diverges as
287

model size increases, highlighting the potential for scaling
288

up masked image modeling to enhance instruction-image
289

alignment and elevate generation quality.
290

5
Limitations and Social Impact
291

Limitations. Despite Fantasy achieving competitive performance in text-image alignment and visual
292

appeal, it requires improvements in handling complex scenes. We propose two possible strategies to
293

overcome the challenge in future research: Firstly, augmenting the dataset with high-quality images
294

can enhance diversity and refine the model. Secondly, since the scale of the masked image generator
295

affects instruction-image alignment, training an upscale image generator based on higher resolution
296

left further explored.
297

Social Impact. Generative models for media bring both benefits and challenges. They foster creativity
298

and make technology more accessible, yet pose risks by facilitating the creation of manipulated
299

content, spreading misinformation, and exacerbating biases, particularly affecting women with deep
300

fakes. Concerns also include the potential exposure of sensitive training data collected without
301

consent. Despite generative models potentially offering better data representation, the impact of
302

combining adversarial training with likelihood-based objectives on data distortion remains a crucial
303

research area. Ethical considerations of these models are significant and require thorough exploration.
304

Conclusion
305

In this paper, we introduce Fantasy, a lightweight and efficient text-to-image model that combines
306

Large Language Models (LLMs) with a transformer-based masked image modeling (MIM), effec-
307

tively transferring semantic understanding capabilities from LLMs to the text-to-image generation.
308

With our proposed two-stage training strategy and high-quality dataset, Fantasy significantly re-
309

duces computational requirements while producing high-fidelity images. Extensive experiments
310

demonstrate that Fantasy achieves comparable performance to models trained with significantly more
311

computational resources, illustrating the viability of our approach and suggesting potential efficient
312

scalability to even larger masked image modeling for text-to-image generation.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
448

1. Claims
449

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
450

paper’s contributions and scope?
451

Answer: [Yes]
452

Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly define the paper’s contributions, which
453

involve advancements in urban simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. These
454

claims are backed by robust experimental validation detailed in the subsequent sections.
455

Guidelines:
456

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
457

made in the paper.
458

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
459

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
460

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
461

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
462

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
463

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
464

are not attained by the paper.
465

2. Limitations
466

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
467

Answer: [Yes]
468

Justification: We have included a comprehensive discussion on limitations, particularly
469

focusing on the scalability of our simulations in extremely large urban environments and
470

potential biases in the modeling processes.
471

Guidelines:
472

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
473

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
474

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
475

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
476

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
477

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
478

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
479

implications would be.
480

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
481

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
482

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
483

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
484

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
485

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
486

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
487

technical jargon.
488

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
489

and how they scale with dataset size.
490

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
491

address problems of privacy and fairness.
492

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
493

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
494

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
495

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
496

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
497

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
498

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
499

13


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
500

a complete (and correct) proof?
501

Answer: [Yes]
502

Justification: All theoretical results are accompanied by a clear statement of assumptions and
503

are supported by complete proofs provided in the supplementary materials. Each theorem
504

and lemma are properly referenced and numbered for clarity and ease of access.
505

Guidelines:
506

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
507

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
508

referenced.
509

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
510

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
511

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
512

proof sketch to provide intuition.
513

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
514

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
515

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
516

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
517

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
518

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
519

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
520

Answer: [Yes]
521

Justification: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including
522

data splits, hyperparameters, and the type of optimizer used. We also provide access to the
523

source code and datasets in the supplementary materials to ensure full reproducibility.
524

Guidelines:
525

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
526

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
527

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
528

whether the code and data are provided or not.
529

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
530

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
531

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
532

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
533

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
534

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
535

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
536

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
537

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
538

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
539

appropriate to the research performed.
540

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
541

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
542

nature of the contribution. For example
543

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
544

to reproduce that algorithm.
545

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
546

the architecture clearly and fully.
547

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
548

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
549

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
550

the dataset).
551

14


---Page Break---
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
552

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
553

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
554

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
555

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
556

5. Open access to data and code
557

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
558

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
559

material?
560

Answer: [Yes]
561

Justification: The paper does not propose a benchmark and we will release the code if the
562

paper is accepted. The model depends on non-open-sourced dataset, and the copyright of the
563

checkpoint belongs to the company. Detailed instructions for training our model, including
564

command lines, are provided in the supplementary materials.
565

Guidelines:
566

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
567

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
568

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
569

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
570

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
571

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
572

benchmark).
573

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
574

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
575

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
576

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
577

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
578

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
579

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
580

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
581

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
582

versions (if applicable).
583

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
584

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
585

6. Experimental Setting/Details
586

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
587

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
588

results?
589

Answer: [Yes]
590

Justification: The experimental section of the paper provides comprehensive details about
591

the training and test setups, including the rationale behind choosing specific hyperparameters
592

and the types of optimizers used.
593

Guidelines:
594

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
595

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
596

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
597

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
598

material.
599

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
600

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
601

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
602

Answer: [Yes]
603

15


---Page Break---
Justification: All experimental results are presented with error bars reflecting the standard
604

deviation across multiple runs. We provide a detailed explanation of how these were
605

calculated and the assumptions underlying our statistical tests.
606

Guidelines:
607

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
608

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
609

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
610

the main claims of the paper.
611

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
612

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
613

run with given experimental conditions).
614

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
615

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
616

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
617

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
618

of the mean.
619

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
620

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
621

of Normality of errors is not verified.
622

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
623

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
624

error rates).
625

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
626

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
627

8. Experiments Compute Resources
628

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
629

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
630

the experiments?
631

Answer: [Yes]
632

Justification: The paper details the computational resources required for each experiment,
633

including the types of GPUs used, the amount of memory, and the execution time. This
634

ensures that other researchers can allocate the appropriate resources to reproduce our results.
635

Guidelines:
636

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
637

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
638

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
639

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
640

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
641

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
642

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
643

didn’t make it into the paper).
644

9. Code Of Ethics
645

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
646

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
647

Answer: [Yes]
648

Justification: Our research adheres strictly to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. We have consid-
649

ered ethical implications, especially regarding the generation of images from text, and have
650

implemented measures to prevent misuse.
651

Guidelines:
652

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
653

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
654

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
655

16


---Page Break---
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
656

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
657

10. Broader Impacts
658

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
659

societal impacts of the work performed?
660

Answer: [Yes]
661

Justification: The paper includes content about broader impacts that discusses both the
662

potential positive applications of our method in educational and creative industries, and
663

potential negative impacts, such as the misuse of generated images. We also suggest
664

mitigation strategies for potential negative uses.
665

Guidelines:
666

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
667

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
668

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
669

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
670

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
671

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
672

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
673

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
674

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
675

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
676

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
677

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
678

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
679

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
680

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
681

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
682

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
683

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
684

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
685

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
686

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
687

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
688

11. Safeguards
689

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
690

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
691

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
692

Answer: [NA]
693

Justification: Our paper poses no such risks. If then, we will describe the safeguards
694

implemented in releasing our models, including usage guidelines and limitations to access,
695

ensuring responsible use and mitigating risks of misuse.
696

Guidelines:
697

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
698

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
699

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
700

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
701

safety filters.
702

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
703

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
704

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
705

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
706

faith effort.
707

12. Licenses for existing assets
708

---Page Break---
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
709

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
710

properly respected?
711

Answer: [Yes]
712

Justification: All third-party assets used in our research are properly credited, and we have
713

explicitly mentioned and complied with the licensing terms. URLs and version numbers of
714

datasets and code are clearly listed in the references.
715

Guidelines:
716

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
717

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
718

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
719

URL.
720

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
721

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
722

service of that source should be provided.
723

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
724

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
725

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
726

license of a dataset.
727

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
728

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
729

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
730

the asset’s creators.
731

13. New Assets
732

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
733

provided alongside the assets?
734

Answer: [Yes]
735

Justification: Any new datasets or models introduced in the paper are accompanied by
736

thorough documentation detailing their creation, intended use, limitations, and licensing
737

information.
738

Guidelines:
739

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
740

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
741

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
742

limitations, etc.
743

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
744

asset is used.
745

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
746

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
747

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
748

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
749

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
750

well as details about compensation (if any)?
751

Answer: [NA]
752

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing experiments or research with
753

human subjects.
754

Guidelines:
755

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
756

human subjects.
757

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
758

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
759

included in the main paper.
760

18

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
761

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
762

collector.
763

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
764

Subjects
765

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
766

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
767

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
768

institution) were obtained?
769

Answer: [NA]
770

Justification: Our research did not involve human subjects, thus no IRB approval was
771

necessary.
772

Guidelines:
773

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
774

human subjects.
775

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
776

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
777

should clearly state this in the paper.
778

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
779

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
780

guidelines for their institution.
781

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
782

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
