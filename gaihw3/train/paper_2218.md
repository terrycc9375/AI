Abstract

The scale and quality of a dataset significantly impact the performance of deep
models. However, acquiring large-scale annotated datasets is both a costly and time-
consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, dataset expansion technologies aim
to automatically augment datasets, unlocking the full potential of deep models. Cur-
rent data expansion techniques include image transformation and image synthesis
methods. Transformation-based methods introduce only local variations, leading
to limited diversity. In contrast, synthesis-based methods generate entirely new
content, greatly enhancing informativeness. However, existing synthesis methods
carry the risk of distribution deviations, potentially degrading model performance
with out-of-distribution samples. In this paper, we propose DistDiff, a training-free
data expansion framework based on the distribution-aware diffusion model. Dist-
Diff constructs hierarchical prototypes to approximate the real data distribution,
optimizing latent data points within diffusion models with hierarchical energy
guidance. We demonstrate its capability to generate distribution-consistent sam-
ples, significantly improving data expansion tasks. DistDiff consistently enhances
accuracy across a diverse range of datasets compared to models trained solely
on original data. Furthermore, our approach consistently outperforms existing
synthesis-based techniques and demonstrates compatibility with widely adopted
transformation-based augmentation methods. Additionally, the expanded dataset
exhibits robustness across various architectural frameworks. Our code is available

Introduction

A substantial number of training samples are essential for unlocking the full potential of deep
networks. However, the manual collection and labeling of large-scale datasets are both costly and
time-intensive. This makes it difficult to expand data-scarce datasets. Therefore, it is of great value to
study how to expand high-quality training data in an efficient and scalable way [6].

Automatic data expansion technology can alleviate the data scarcity problem by augmenting or
creating diverse samples, it mitigates the bottleneck associated with limited data, thereby improv-
ing model’s downstream performance and fostering greater generalization [14, 78]. One simple
yet effective strategy is employing image transformation techniques such as cropping, rotation,
and erasing to augment samples [59]. Although these methods prove effective and have been
widely applied in various fields, their pre-defined perturbations only introduce local variations
to the images, thereby falling short in providing a diverse range of content change. In recent

times, generative models have gained considerable attention [18, 44, 47, 50, 54, 45], exhibit im-
pressive performance in various areas like image inpainting [36, 53], super-resolution [26, 55],
and video generation [25, 41]. Generative models leverage text and image conditions to create
images with entirely novel content, harnessing the expansive potential of data expansion [13].
Nevertheless, there is a risk of generating images that deviate from the real data distribution.

Figure 1: A comparison unveils distinctions be-
tween conventional data expansion methods and
our innovative distribution-aware diffusion frame-
work, benefiting from hierarchical clustering and
multi-step energy guidance.

Therefore, when employing diffusion models
for dataset expansion tasks, further research is
necessary to ensure a match between synthetic
data distributions and real data distributions.

There are several strategies aimed at mitigat-
ing the risk of distribution shift, which can be
broadly categorized into two groups: training-
based and training-free methods. The training-
based methods [42, 52, 65] fine-tune pre-trained
diffusion models to adapt target dataset, neces-
sitating additional training costs and increas-
ing the likelihood of overfitting on small-scale
datasets. Other training-free methods [17, 22]
eliminate potentially noisy samples by design-
ing optimizing and filtering strategies, but they
still struggle to generate data that conforms to
the real data distribution.

In this work, we propose a training-free data
expansion framework, dubbed Distribution-Aware Diffusion (DistDiff) to optimize generation results.
As shown in Figure 1, DistDiff initially approximates the true data distribution using class-level and
group-level prototypes obtained through hierarchical clustering. Subsequently, DistDiff utilizes these
prototypes to formulate two synergistic energy functions. A residual multiplicative transformation
is then applied to the latent data points, enabling the generation of data distinct from the original.
Following this, the hierarchical energy guidance process refines intermediate predicted data points,
optimizing the diffusion model to generate data samples that are consistent with the underlying
distribution. DistDiff ensures fidelity and diversity in the generated samples through distribution-
aware energy guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that DistDiff outperforms advanced data
expansion techniques, producing better expansion effects and significantly improving downstream
model performance. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We introduce a novel diffusion-based data expansion algorithm, named DistDiff, which
facilitates distribution-consistent data augmentation without requiring re-training.

• By leveraging hierarchical prototypes to approximate data distribution, we propose an
effective distribution-aware energy guidance at both class and group levels in the diffusion
sampling process.

• The experimental results illustrate that our DistDiff is capable of generating high-quality
samples, surpassing existing image transformation and synthesis methods significantly.

Transformation-Based Data Augmentation

Traditional data augmentation techniques [5, 10, 23, 74, 76, 81, 82] typically involve expanding
the dataset through distortive transformations, aiming to enhance the model’s ability to capture
data invariance and mitigate overfitting [59]. For instance, scale invariance is cultivated through
random cropping and scaling, while rotation invariance is developed through random rotation and
flipping. Region mask-based methods [5, 12, 82] enhance model robustness against target occlusion
by strategically obscuring portions of the target area. Interpolation-based methods [23, 74, 76]
generate virtual samples by randomly blending content from two images. RandAugment [10] further
boosts augmentation effectiveness by sampling from a diverse range of augmentation strategies.
However, these methods induce only subtle changes on the original data through transformation,
deletion, and blending, leading to a lack of diversity. Moreover, they are predefined and uniformly
applied across the entire dataset, which may not be optimal for varying data types or scenarios.

guidance. Subsequently, original generated data point zt is refined for improved alignment with the
real distribution.

2.2
Synthesis-Based Data Augmentation

Generative data augmentation aims to leverage generative models to approximate the real data
distribution, generating samples with novel content to enhance data diversity. GAN [18] excels at
learning data distributions and producing unseen samples in an unsupervised manner [1, 20, 33, 39,
79, 80, 67]. While their efficacy has been demonstrated across diverse downstream tasks, studies
indicate that training existing models like ResNet50 [21] on images synthesized by BigGAN [4] yields
subpar results compared to training on real images. This disparity in performance can be attributed
to the limited diversity and potential domain gap between synthesized samples and real images.
Additionally, the training processes of GAN are notoriously unstable, particularly with a low-data
regime, and suffer from mode collapse, resulting in a lack of diversity [3, 19, 48]. In contrast, diffusion
model-based methods [69] can offer better controllability and superior customization capabilities.
Text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion [50], DALL-E 2 [47] and RPG [71] have demonstrated
the creation of compelling high-resolution images [70, 72, 77]. Recently, large-scale text-to-image
models have been used for data generation [2, 15, 35, 58, 64, 63]. For example, LECF [22] utilized
GLIDE [44] to generate images, filtering low-confidence samples to enhance zero-shot and few-shot
image classification performance. SGID [32] leverages image descriptions generated by BLIP [34] to
enhance the semantic consistency of generated samples. Feng et al. [17] filters out low-quality samples
based on feature similarity between generated and reference images. GIF [78] creates new informative
samples through prediction entropy and feature divergence optimization. However, it’s crucial to
note that datasets generated by existing methods may exhibit distribution shifts, impacting image
classification performance significantly. Zhou et al. [83] address this issue by employing diffusion
inversion to mitigate distributional shifts. In contrast, we propose a training-free approach, leveraging
hierarchical prototypes as optimization targets to guide the generation process, thereby addressing
distributional shifts. This approach offers the advantage of avoiding additional computational costs
and overfitting issues associated with fine-tuning diffusion models.

Method

In this study, we introduce a distribution-aware data expansion framework utilizing Stable Diffusion as
a prior generation model. This framework guides the diffusion model based on hierarchical prototype
guidance criteria. As illustrated in Figure 2, our DistDiff initially employs an image encoder θ to
extract instance features and subsequently derives hierarchical prototypes to approximate the real
data distribution. Next, for a given seed image and corresponding text prompts, we extract image’s

latent feature and apply stochastic noise to it. Subsequently, in the denoising process, we optimize the
latent features using a training-free hierarchical energy guidance process. Our optimization strategy
ensures that the generated samples not only match the distribution but also carry new information to
enhance model training.

3.1
Task Definition

In the context of a small-scale training dataset, the data expansion task is designed to augment
the original dataset Do = {xi, yi}no
i=1 with a new set of synthetic samples, referred to as Ds =
{x′
i, y′
i}ns
i=1. Here xi and yi represent the sample and its corresponding label, where no and ns
respectively denote the original sample quantity and the synthetic sample quantity. The objective is
to enhance the performance of a deep learning model trained on both the original dataset Do and the
expanded dataset Ds compared to a model trained solely on the original Do. The crucial aspect lies
in ensuring that the generated dataset is highly consistent with the distribution of the original dataset
while being as informative as possible.

3.2
Hierarchical Prototypes Approximate Data Distribution

Prototypes have been widely employed in class incremental learning methods to retain information
about each class [40, 49]. In this work, we propose two levels of prototypes to capture the original
data distribution. Firstly, the class-level prototypes pc are obtained by averaging feature vectors
within the same class. The class vector aggregates high-level statistical information to characterize
all samples from the same class as a collective entity. However, as class-level prototypes represent
the class feature space as a single vector, potentially reducing informativeness, we further introduce
group-level prototypes to capture the structure of the class feature space. Specifically, we divide all
samples from the same class into K groups using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, followed by
averaging feature vectors within each group to obtain K group prototypes pg = {p1
g, p2
g, ..., pK
g }.
Instances with similar patterns are grouped together. Transitioning from class-level to group-level,
the prototypes encapsulate abstract distribution information of the class at different scales.

Thanks to these hierarchical prototypes, we design two function Dc
θ and Dg
θ to evaluate the degree of
distribution matching:
Dc
θ(x, pc) = ∥θ(x) −pc∥2,
(1)

Dg
θ(x, pg) = ∥θ(x) −pj
g∥2,

s.t.j = arg max(cos(θ(x), {pj
g}K
j=1)),
(2)

where θ(·) means feature extractor, which could be ResNet [21], CLIP [46] or other deep models.

Note that these two functions evaluate the score of distribution matching from two perspectives. The
value will be lower when x is more consistent with the real distribution. As shown in Figure 2 (a),
Dc
θ gauges the distance of sample features to the class center, resulting in low scores for easy samples
while high scores for hard samples that are situated at the boundaries of the distribution. On the
other hand, Dg
θ assesses distance from the group-level, offering lower scores for hard samples, while
still maintaining relatively high scores for outlier samples. Consequently, these two scores mutually
reinforce each other and are indispensable.

3.3
Transform Data Points

Given a reference sample (x, y), the pre-trained large-scale diffusion model G can generate new
samples x′ with novel content. We formalize this process as x′ = G(Φ(x) + δ), where Φ(x)
represents the latent feature representation and δ is the perturbation applied to latent features. Drawing
inspiration from GIF [78], we introduce residual multiplicative transformation to the latent feature
z = Φ(x) using randomly initialized channel-level noise e ∼U(0, 1) and b ∼N(0, 1). We impose
an ϵ-ball constraint on the transformed feature to control the degree of adjustment within a reasonable
range, i.e., ∥z −˜z∥∞≤ϵ, and derive ˜z as follows.

˜z = Pz,ϵ(τ(z)) = Pz,ϵ((1 + e)z + b),
(3)

where τ(·) represents the transformation function and Pz,ϵ(·) denotes the projection of the trans-
formed feature ˜z onto the ϵ-ball of the original latent feature z.

---Page Break---
Now, the key challenge lies in optimizing e and b to create new samples that align closely with the
real data distribution. Another intuitive approach is to directly optimize latent features instead of
performing residual multiplication transformations. However, directly optimizing latent features
leads to minimal perturbations, making it challenging to achieve performance gains. We discuss this
alternative approach in Section 4.4.

3.4
Distribution-Aware Diffusion Generation

In a typical diffusion sampling process, the model iteratively predicts noise to progressively map
the noisy zT into clean z0. While existing data expansion methods [17, 22, 32] treat the generative
model as a black box, focusing on filtering or optimizing the final generated z0. The importance
of the intermediate sampling stage is ignored, which plays a crucial role in ensuring data quality,
especially as the image begins to take on a stable shape appearance. Diverging from prior approaches,
we advocate for intervention at the intermediate denoising step for optimization.

Specifically, we first introduce energy guidance into standard reverse sampling process to optimize
the transformation using Equation 4. As our energy guidance step is applied to the transformed data
point, the transformed data point ˜zt is denoted as zt for simplicity.

e′ = e −ρ∇eε(zt, c),

b′ = b −ρ∇bε(zt, c),
(4)

where ρ is the learning rate and ε(zt, c) is the energy function measuring the compatibility between
the transformed noisy data point zt and the given condition c, representing the real data distribution
in this work. Equation 4 guides the sampling process and generates distribution-consistent samples.
After that, the optimized z′
t is obtained via Equation 3. However, directly measuring the distance
between intermediate results zt with condition c is impractical due to the difficulty in finding a
pre-trained network that provides meaningful guidance when the input is noisy.

To address this issue, we leverage the capability that the diffusion model can predict the noise added
to zt, and thus predict a clean data point z0|t, as shown in Equation 5. Then, the new energy function
Dθ(z0|t, c) based on the predicted clean data point is constructed to approximate ε(zt, c).

z0|t = zt −√1 −αtψ(zt, t)
√αt
,
(5)

where αt represents the noise scale and ψ is the learned denoising network. Finally, we employ
hierarchical prototypes pc and pg as conditions to construct our energy guidance in the following
manner:
e′ = e −ρ∇e(Dc
θ(z0|t, pc) + Dg
θ(z0|t, pg)),

b′ = b −ρ∇b(Dc
θ(z0|t, pc) + Dg
θ(z0|t, pg)).
(6)

Unlike existing methods that exclusively optimize the final sampling result z0, our approach focuses
on optimizing intermediate denoising steps within the sampling process. The detailed algorithm is
shown in Appendix C. This novel strategy leads to substantial improvements in optimization results
and will be further explored in Section 4.4.

Experimental Setups

Datasets
We assess the performance of DistDiff across six image classification datasets, encom-
passing diverse tasks such as general object classification (Caltech-101 [16], CIFAR100-Subset [31],
ImageNette [27]), fine-grained classification (Cars [30]), textual classification (DTD [8]) and medical
imaging (PathMNIST [68]). More details are provided in Appendix B.1.

Compared Methods
We conduct a comparative analysis between DistDiff and conventional image
transformation methods, as well as diffusion-based expansion methods. Traditional image transfor-
mation techniques considered in the comparison comprise AutoAugment [9], RandAugment [10],
Random Erasing [82], GridMask [5], and interpolation-based techniques like MixUp [76] and CutMix

[74]. For generative-based methods, we include the direct application of stable diffusion for data
expansion, as well as the most recent state-of-the-art method, Stable Diffusion 1.4 [50], LECF [22],
GIF-SD [78]. The implementation details of these techniques are provided in Appendix B.3 and B.4.

4.2
Implementation Details

In our experimental setup, we implement DistDiff based on Stable Diffusion 1.4 [50]. The images
created by Stable Diffusion have a resolution of 512 × 512 for all datasets. Throughout the diffusion
process, we employ the DDIM [60] sampler for a 50-step latent diffusion, with hyper-parameters for
noise strength set at 0.5 and classifier free guidance scale at 7.5. The ϵ in Equation 3 is 0.2 by default.
We use a ResNet-50 [21] model trained from scratch on the original datasets as our guidance model.
We assign K = 3 to each class when constructing group-level prototypes, the learning rate ρ is 10.0,
and optimization step M is set to 20 unless specified otherwise. After expansion, we concatenate the
original dataset with synthetic data to create expanded datasets. We then train the classification model
from random initialization for 100 epochs using these expanded datasets. During model training, we
process images through random cropping to 224 × 224 using random rotation and random horizontal
flips. Our optimization strategy involves using the SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9, and
cosine decay with an initial learning rate of 0.1. All results are averaged over three runs with different
random seeds. More implementation details can be found in the Appendix B.2.

Comparison with Synthesis-Based Methods
To investigate the effectiveness of methods
for generating high-quality datasets for down-
stream classification model training, we ini-
tially compare our method, DistDiff, with exist-
ing synthesis-based methods on Caltech-101in
terms of classification performance. Figure 3
highlights the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art techniques. Compared to the
original stable diffusion, DistDiff exhibits an av-
erage improvement of 6.25%, illustrating that
our method retains more distribution-aligned in-
formation from the original datasets. Addition-
ally, GIF-SD [78], which uses a pre-trained CLIP [46] model to enhance class-maintained information
and employs KL-divergence to encourage batch-wise sample diversity, is also surpassed by our
method by 5.46% in accuracy. This can be attributed to DistDiff guiding the generation process from
the distribution level with hierarchical prototypes, providing better optimization signals.

We also evaluated DistDiff against LECF [22], which enhances language prompts and filters samples
with low confidence. We use LE enhanced to synthesize 5× synthetic datasets and filter with different
thresholds. We assessed multiple Clip Filtering strengths in LECF and found that LECF did not
achieve better performance compared to the original Stable Diffusion. This is due to our SD baseline
already generates high-quality samples, and the additional filtering post-process may lead to data loss.
Besides, both LECF and GIF-SD use auxiliary models to filter/guide the diffusion generation results.
However, there are two main strengths of our DistDiff compared to these methods. First, DistDiff
generates images end-to-end without requiring filter-based postprocessing. Second, our method is not
sensitive to the classification performance of the auxiliary model, which is proved in the Appendix
D.2. This suggests that DistDiff is simpler and more generalizable for data expansion tasks.
Comparison with Transformation-Based Augmentation Methods
In Table 1, we present a
comparison of our methods with widely adopted data augmentation techniques for Caltech-101image
classification. Our DistDiff method surpasses transformation-based augmentation methods by intro-
ducing a broader range of new content into images. Additionally, we demonstrate the compatibility of
our approach with transformation-based data augmentation methods, leading to further improvements.

Scaling in Number of Data
We evaluate the scalability of our approach by assessing its advantages
in classification model training across four datasets. We compare the performance of DistDiff with
the original real dataset and strong augmentation method AutoAug [9] with varying numbers of

improvement in accuracy also enlarges. The accuracy on Caltech-101achieved with our 5× expansion
surpasses even the 20× expanded dataset obtained by AutoAug and diffusion baseline. This indicates
that DistDiff exhibits superior efficiency in data expansion compared to existing methods.

Versatility to Various Architectures
We conduct an in-depth assessment of the expanded datasets
generated by DistDiffacross four distinct backbones: ResNet-50 [21], ResNeXt-50 [66], WideResNet-
50 [75], and MobileNetv2 [56].
These backbones are trained from scratch on 5× expanded
Caltech-101dataset by DistDiff. The results presented in Table 3 affirm that our innovative methodol-
ogy is effective and versatile across a spectrum of architectures.

Comparison with Stronger Classification Models
As we know, data expansion is typically applied
in scenarios with data scarcity. However, if we use models pre-trained on large-scale datasets, the
performance on the original training set can be significantly enhanced. In such cases, does our
expanded dataset still offer improvements? To validate our method, we fine-tuned a ResNet-50 model
pre-trained on ImageNet-1k [11] for ImageNette, Caltech-101, and StanfordCars, and a LAION [57]
pre-trained CLIP-ViT-B32 [6] model for PathMNIST. As shown in Table 2, the model achieved a
high accuracy of 99.4% on ImageNette, which is a subset of its pretrained datasets. Further data
expansion resulted in a slight decrease in performance. Similarly, on the general image dataset
Caltech-101, which shares significant overlap with ImageNet data, our method demonstrated only
slight improvement. However, on the more challenging fine-grained dataset StanfordCars, our method
demonstrated obvious 3.56% accuracy improvement. For the medical image dataset PathMNIST,
which exhibits a significantly different distribution, using DistDiff for data expansion effectively
boosted classification performance by 5.18%. This highlights the importance of scaling up data when
transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks that exhibit significant distribution shifts.

Hierarchical Prototypes
We delved further into how each component of DistDiff impacts its data
expansion performance. As depicted in Table 4, utilizing both pc and pg contributes to enhancing
the model’s expansion performance, showcasing their ability to optimize the generated sample
distribution at the class-level and group-level, respectively. Moreover, combining pc and pg results in
a further performance improvement, validating the effectiveness of integrating representations from
different hierarchical levels. Additionally, with the introduction of our approach, the Fréchet Inception
Distance (FID) values notably decrease, indicating that our proposed FID effectively optimizes the
model to generate samples more aligned with the real distribution, thereby reducing the domain gap
between the generated dataset and the real dataset.

Augmentation within Diffusion
In the application of energy guidance, perturbation is introduced
at the M-th step, and these subsequent predicted data points are optimized. Theoretically, optimizing
predictions at different stages yields distinct effects. Our exploration focused on the optimization step
M, and the experimental results are illustrated in Table 5. When M is small, indicating optimization
at a later stage (i.e., the refinement stage), the change in generated results is already minimal, resulting
in relatively consistent optimization outcomes. Conversely, when M increases, corresponding to
optimization at an intermediate stage (i.e., the semantic stage), the generated results are in the stage
of forming semantics and exhibit significant changes. Hence, this stage plays a crucial role in
determining the final generated results. Furthermore, there is a decline in performance during the
early chaos stage (M=25), as the data points in this initial phase are too chaotic to establish an
optimal target for optimization. We observed that achieving higher data expansion performance is
possible when optimized in the semantic stage, with optimal results obtained when M=20.

More Optimization Steps
Furthermore, a natural idea arises regarding the potential improvement
in effectiveness through the optimization of more optimization steps. Therefore, we further explored
increasing the number of steps in the semantic stages. As shown in Table 7, increasing the number
of optimization steps in semantic stages enhances performance. However, further increases in
optimization steps lead to a decline in performance. This can be attributed to excessive optimization
strength in energy guidance, which causes data distortion.

Compared with Direct Guidance on Latent Point
We evaluate our transform guidance strategy
against an alternative strategy that directly guides the latent data points while ignoring the residual
transform preprocess, a method found useful in previous works [24, 73]. We initially conducted a
grid search for this alternative strategy to find the optimal learning rate, ρ (i.e., [0.1, 1, 10, 20]), and
guide step, M (i.e., [1, 10, 20]). We found the best result of 76.77% was achieved with ρ = 10 and
M = 10, which is only slightly better than the original Stable Diffusion but lags behind our DistDiff,
which achieved 83.19%. This indicates that applying the residual multiplicative transformation to the
latent feature offers more optimization potential.

Determination of Group-Level Prototype Number K
The determination of the number K
of group-level prototypes is crucial for accurately approximating the real data distribution. In
Table 6, we compare the outcomes associated with varying numbers of prototypes. The results
highlight that the optimal number of prototypes is found at K = 3. We posit that an insufficient
number of prototypes may impede the characterization of the real distribution, leading to diminished
performance. Conversely, an excessive number of prototypes may lead to overfitting of noisy sample
points, also resulting in suboptimal performance. Furthermore, we present a visualization analysis
of group-level prototypes in Figure 6. The visual representation demonstrates that an appropriate
number of group-level prototypes can effectively cover the real distribution space, aligning with the
underlying motivation of our DistDiff.

(b) K = 2
(c) K = 3
(d) K = 4

Figure 6: The visualization of group-level prototypes alongside original sample features. Here •
is the sample point and ⋆is group-level prototype. By selecting an appropriate number K, these
prototypes effectively span the feature space, providing an approximation of the real data distribution.

Computational Efficiency
Our DistDiff is not only training-free but also highly efficient in
processing. As illustrated in Figure 2, DistDiff introduces only a few optimization steps in the
original diffusion process. We analyze the time costs of our methods. Stable Diffusion generates per
sample in 12.65 seconds on average, while our DistDiff achieves the same in 13.13 seconds, with the
increased time costs being negligible. We can conclude that DistDiff achieves a notable improvement
over stable diffusion models, with only a slight increase in computation costs.

Conclusion
This paper presents DistDiff, a distribution-aware data expansion method employing a stable diffusion
model for data expansion. The proposed method optimizes the diffusion process to align the synthe-
sized data distribution with the real data distribution. Specifically, DistDiff constructs hierarchical
prototypes to effectively represent the real data distribution and refines intermediate features within
the sampling process using energy guidance. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments
on six datasets, showcasing its superior performance over existing methods.

Limitations and Societal Impacts

Limitations
Although DistDiff achieves better FID scores and enhances classifier performance
without the need for training, it may incur additional computation time, which accumulates as data
scales up. Additionally, our method requires an extra guide model, increasing development costs.
Integrating a fast sampler [37] and lightweight guide model represents a promising direction for
maximizing the effectiveness of diffusion-based data expansion methods in classifier training.

Societal Impacts
Generative models [47, 50] can significantly reduce the costs associated with
manual data collection and annotation. Our approach builds an efficient method that enhances the
distributional consistency of these generative models for downstream tasks without requiring training,
thereby improving performance on downstream classifiers. This capability can assist organizations
and researchers with limited data resources in developing more effective machine learning models.

However, since generative models are pre-trained on vast, diverse vision-language datasets from the
internet, these data may contain social biases and stereotypes [7, 43, 51], leading to discriminatory
generated outputs. Therefore, integrating mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases is crucial.
Nevertheless, our method guides the generation process decisions based on task-specific hierarchical
prototypes, fostering AI systems that better align with downstream task distributions and exhibit
fewer biases.

Another potential concern is the misuse of generated data, which could be exploited for malicious
purposes such as deepfakes [38], resulting in misinformation dissemination and adverse societal
impacts. Proper constraints on the proliferation and correct usage of generative models are crucial.
This necessitates the establishment of relevant regulations and guidelines to ensure the responsible
development and utilization of synthetic data models.

Cifar100-Subset and PathMNIST are subsets that randomly sampled from the original trainset
with 100 samples per class. Specifically, our evaluation encompasses datasets that span diverse
scenarios, incorporating generic objects, fine-grained categories, and textural images. These diverse

Our Method

We implement our methods using the PyTorch framework with Python 3.10.6. We utilize the diffuser
[62] to implement our base diffusion models. For all datasets, we generate images with a noise
strength of 0.5, except for the medical image dataset PathMNIST, where we use a noise strength
of 0.2. The guidance step M in our method is 20 by default, except for 10 for PathMNIST. The
half-precision floating-point is used in the generation process to reduce memory costs. The generation,
training, and evaluation processes are conducted on a single GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. We report

the best test accuracy averaged over three runs and calculate the FID metric using 3000 samples.
In order to reduce generation time costs, we pre-compute and save the latent embeddings for all
training samples. We use Stable Diffusion 1.4 as our base generation model3. We follow previous
data expansion methods by expanding each sample certain ratios. The sampling category distribution
is consistent with the original dataset category distribution.

B.3
Synthesis-Based Augmentation Contenders

Due to benchmark and training setting differences in existing works [78, 2, 33], in order to fairly
compare existing methods with ours, we reproduced two state-of-the-art generation-based methods:
GIF-SD [78] and LECF [2] on our benchmarks and base diffusion model. For GIF-SD, we used a
pretrained CLIP-ViT-B32 model to facilitate its class-maintained optimization, and a batch size of 4
to facilitate its KL-divergence based diverse sampling. For LECF, we generated 200 prompts for each
class prompt, and generated samples with sizes equal to our method’s, filtering these samples with a
specified threshold using a pretrained ResNet50-CLIP model. As shown in Section 4.3, our methods
surpass these contenders.

B.4
Transformation-Based Augmentation Contenders

We outline the transformation-based augmentation methods compared in our experiments. The
effectiveness of all these methods are evaluated on the same datasets and with the same configuration
(e.g., learning rate, epochs, batch size, etc.) as our method.

Default: We use random crop, random horizontal flip, and random rotation with a 15-degree angle as
default augmentation strategies.

AutoAug [9]: We employ the AutoAugment function in PyTorch with the widely used ImageNet
policy, which includes a diverse range of color and shape transformations. During training, one
transformation strategy is randomly selected and applied.

RandAug [10]: Similar to AutoAug, we randomly choose two operations from a predefined policy
list and apply them to the training samples.

Random Erasing [82]: We use the random erase function in PyTorch for Random Erasing. This
function randomly selects a rectangular region within an image and erases its pixels with a 50%
probability. The proportion of erased area relative to the input image ranges from 0.02 to 0.33, and
the aspect ratio of the erased area ranges from 0.3 to 3.3.

GridMask [5]: GridMask is implemented with its official configuration. The probability of applying
GridMask linearly increases from 0 to 0.8 as training epochs progress up to the 80th epoch, after
which it remains constant until 100 epochs.

MixUp [76]: Synthetic interpolated images are generated within each data batch. We sample
the interpolation strength from a beta distribution (beta = 1). The loss function is also adjusted
accordingly.

CutMix [74]: Similar to MixUp, CutMix replaces specified regions in original images with input
from another image. The loss function is modified accordingly.

Model Performance

DistDiff is Robust to Guidance Model
As mentioned in Section 3.2, we employ a extra feature
extractor as our guidance model. To assess the impact of different guidance models, we compared two
backbones: a ResNet-50 [21] trained on the original dataset from scratch (weak backbone) and CLIP
[6], a strong backbone pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned on the original dataset. Table 10
presents the accuracy of the guidance models and the corresponding tuned classifier (ResNet-50). Our
DistDiff method demonstrates robustness, showing negligible changes in accuracy (0.25%) across
different guidance models. This highlights the robustness of our approach. To ensure fairness in
comparison without knowledge leakage from large pre-trained models, we default to using a randomly
initialized ResNet-50 trained on the original dataset as our guidance model.

Table 10: Comparison of guidance models on Caltech-101 dataset. We compared the accuracy of two
guidance models on the original Caltech-101 dataset. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of
a downstream classifier trained on the 5× expanded dataset using corresponding guide model.

Determination of Guidance Scale ρ.
We compared different learning rates ρ, and the experimental
results are shown in Table 11. A learning rate that is too low results in insufficient optimization.
Conversely, a learning rate that is too high causes over-optimization, leading to image distortion.
Both result in suboptimal performance. We used ρ = 10, which achieves the best results, as the
default learning rate.

Comparison of Varying Gradient Weight.
We compared different contribution levels of two

More Efficiency Comparison
The high efficiency of DistDiff stems from its direct guidance on
the pre-trained model without the need to retrain the diffusion models. We provide computational
time comparison in Table 13. Compared to the stable diffusion baseline model, we only introduce an
extra 0.48 seconds of inference time per sample, which is only 4% of the original inference time. Our
method incurs minimal additional time costs and generates samples directly, unlike LECF, which
needs extra post-processing to filter low-confidence samples. This makes LECF slower in generating
the same number of samples. We are incorporating this cost analysis into the paper.

that the actual time required of LECF to derive one sample after filter post-processing. Evaluation

More Baseline Comparison
We add two more baseline: DA-Fusion [61] and DiffuseMix [29], for
comparison. As shown in Table 14. Our method outperforms both baselines. DA-Fusion modifies
images while respecting semantic attributes but lacks fine-grained control and incurs additional time
costs (around 14 minutes per class on a 3090 GPU) . Our training-free method uses hierarchical
guidance for better alignment with the real distribution. DiffuseMix, which uses bespoke prompts
and fractal images for augmentation, treats all datasets equally and may not handle distribution shifts
well. Our method shows superior performance compared to these approaches.

More Ablation Experiments
We add more ablation experiments on StanfordCars dataset. Our
method shows more benefits with fine-grained datasets with greater class variance, as illustrated in
Table 15. Additionally, having more groups is not always beneficial; an excessive number of groups
may cause prototypes to fit noise points or outliers, which could degrade performance.

DistDiff is Effective on Large-Scale Dataset
In this work, we follow previous work, such as
GIF-SD and DA-Fusion, in conducting experiments on small datasets, as data augmentation strategies
are often necessary in data-scarcity scenarios. Besides, we also conducted experiments on ImageNet
with 0.2× expanding ratios, resulting in approximately 256K generated samples. As shown in Table
16, our method demonstrates improvements on large-scale datasets.

Further Analysis

Trade-Off Between Fidelity and Diversity
The data expansion task requires both high fidelity
and diversity for effective model training. However, this principle does not universally apply across
all scenarios. We assessed the trade-off between high fidelity and diversity by adjusting the diffusion
model’s strength in adding noise to original images. As the noise strength increases, the diversity of
generated data enhances, accompanied by a decrease in FID scores. The resulting accuracy and FID
scores are presented in Figure 7, where we observed an inverse relationship between FID (fidelity
metric) and accuracy across the Caltech-101 and PathMNIST datasets. We found that introducing

more new content on general datasets, such as Caltech-101, can benefit model training by emphasizing
the need for diversity. In contrast, on medical datasets with substantial distribution shifts, maintaining
the original data distribution and minimizing disturbances proves to be more effective.

D.3
More Visualization Results

In this section, we provide visualization comparison between original stable diffusion (SD) and our
DistDiff in Figure 8. Visualization results indicate that our method exhibits finer texture details, more
diverse style variations, and stronger foreground-background contrasts, making our samples align
real sample distributions. However, the main content of our images still shows minimal deviation
from SD, making it challenging for users to discern differences through visual observation alone. In
Section 4.4, we provide quantitative analysis to validate that our method generates data with more
consistent distributions, thereby enhancing performance in downstream classification tasks.

In addition, we visualize more generated samples across six datasets in Figure 9 to demonstrate the
effectiveness of DistDiff. These visualizations confirm that our approach can generate samples with
more distribution-consistent patterns.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract provides a concise summary of the main findings and contributions
of the paper, while the introduction elaborates on the problem statement and research
objectives, thereby clarifying the contributions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix A, we expound upon the limitations of the work conducted and
provide a brief discussion thereof.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

22


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Section 3 and Appendix C, we provide detailed mathematical derivations
for all the formulas appearing in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Section 4.1, we introduced the details of experimental setup and model
training to ensure reproducibility.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

23


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Section 4.1, we introduced the details of experimental setup and model
training, and conducted ablation experiments in Section 4.4 to elucidate the selection of
hyperparameters.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report error bars of our experimental results in Section 4.3 and 4.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

24


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For the experiments, we furnished detailed specifications of the GPU models
used along with their corresponding tasks. Furthermore, we included specific information
regarding the model training batch size and the number of training epochs.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and adhere to its
principles.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed in Appendix A.

25


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creators or original owners of assets, such as code, data, or models, used
in the paper, are properly credited. Additionally, the license and terms of use associated
with these assets are explicitly mentioned and respected in accordance with ethical and legal
standards.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

27


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
