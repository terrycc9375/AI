Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their
billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence
of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by
involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods
only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training
setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity.
In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving
more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training
algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs
to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity
and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly
focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using
non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language
generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms
SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation,
LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity. We make our
code publicly available at GitHub1.

The exponential growth in data volumes and model
sizes has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in large-
scale models, enabling a wide range of applica-
tions [2, 47, 53, 48, 30]. Among them, large lan-
guage models (LLMs), like GPT-3 [2], OPT [47],
and LLaMA [38, 39], have demonstrated impressive
natural language ability. However, the skyrocketing
number of model parameters [21, 36] and dataset
size [51, 45, 52, 44] has introduced challenges in fur-
ther scaling those models. The exponential growth in
model size has not only inflated the deployment costs
of LLMs, due to their significant computational and

memory demands during inference, but also affected the user experience in many latency-sensitive
applications, such as chatbots [1] and autonomous driving [17, 35]. Recent advances have been
leveraging sparsity to improve LLM inference efficiency, including model weight quantization [9]
and pruning [22], token sparsity [50, 46], and activation sparsity [21, 49].

During LLM inference, Feed Forward Network (FFN) layers are the primary efficiency bottleneck,
accounting for over 60% of the FLOPs and I/O operations [21], but they exhibit high activation
sparsity, especially in ReLU-based LLMs [18]. For example, in a 175B OPT model, more than
95% of activations in FFN layers are zeros [21]. Recent advances leverage this activation sparsity
via MoEfication [49, 25]: they convert FFN layers to MoE layers by grouping neurons in the FFN
intermediate layer into n experts and then applying a router to select k most important experts for
each input token. Unlike training the MoE model from scratch, MoEfication converts FFN layers in
pretrained LLMs into MoE layers with relatively small training resources.

However, existing advances only focus on manipulating the pre-trained activation sparsity of neurons,
overlooking the potential for further increasing this inherent sparsity. Moreover, they are limited to
the historically ReLU-based LLMs, whereas emerging advanced models use soft activation functions
for better model quality (e.g., SwiGLU in LLaMA [31] and GeGLU in Gemma [37]), exhibiting
much lower natural activation sparsity. While existing works suggest replacing the model activation
with ReLU to enable sparsity [49, 25], we show that this can hurt model performance (Section 5.2).

In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient and achieve more structured
activation sparsity. As shown in Figure 1, our key insight is that, without compromising model quality,
we can also train LLMs to be efficiency-aware by developing more structured sparsity, which is more
friendly for achieving hardware speedup. However, creating structured sparsity in pretrained LLMs
is non-trivial due to two practical challenges:

1. How to train routers more stably? The widely-used Top-k Softmax routing can lead to a severe
accuracy drop (Section3.2). How to jointly train the model and routers in a MoEfication setting is
still open-ended.
2. How to select the right experts in serving? The number of experts needed in MoE layers depends
on specific inputs and layers, implying a trade-off between model efficiency and quality.

To address these challenges, we introduce Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), a novel training algorithm
to train efficiency-aware models. LTE integrates an efficiency loss penalty, encouraging models
to activate fewer neurons in their FFN layers while keeping good task performance. Additionally,
LTE adopts a threshold-based Sigmoid routing strategy to select experts and employs a two-stage
training mechanism to improve training stability. LTE achieves a more flexible selection of experts
instead of selecting a fixed number of experts for all layers and inputs. Same as Deja Vu [21] and
moefication [49], LTE provides very structured sparsity. We further develop a custom CUDA kernel
with Triton, a Python-like CUDA programming language, to enable wall-clock time speedup from
such structured sparsity (Section 4.3).

We evaluate LTE on both encoder-based models (RoBERTabase, RoBERTalarge [20]) and decoder-based
models (GPT2-Medium [28], LLaMA2-7B [38]) with the HuggingFace’s transformers. Our extensive
experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, downstream Natural Language
Generation (NLG) tasks, and instruction tuning tasks, show that LTE consistently outperforms state-
of-the-art designs. For instance, LLaMA with LTE provides a 1.83x - 2.59x FLOPs speed-up on NLG
tasks without compromising model quality. After integrating our hardware-efficient implementation
of sparse matrix multiplication kernel, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B 25% wall-clock time latency at
around 50% sparsity. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LTE effectively builds more structured
sparsity even on LLMs with soft activation functions.

Related Work

Mixture of Experts (MoE). MoE was proposed by [14] a few decades ago to build an integral system
with subset networks. Recently, MoE layers have been used in the Transformer architecture as a
substitute for the MLP block [32, 7], with the recent Mistral-7B model [15] as a prominent example.
In MLP blocks of MoE transformers, instead of using an FFN layer for calculating output, MoE
layers construct multiple smaller FFN layers and employ a router to choose a subset of experts to do
conditional computation. Even though transformers can have billions of parameters, only a subset of

2


---Page Break---
experts are activated for each token, thus effectively increasing model activation sparsity (i.e., the
number of skipped neurons in execution).

LLM Contextual Sparsity. Recent studies [18, 21] show that trained ReLU-based transformers
naturally show a great sparsity in the activation of FFN layers. For example, in a 175B OPT model,
more than 95% activations in FFN layers are zeros [21]. While SOTA models are increasingly using
diverse soft activations, like GeLU and SwiGLU, existing work shows that replacing soft activations
with ReLU and fine-tuning the model can increase the activation sparsity without greatly hurting
model quality [49, 25, 18]. Yet, we find that this benefit is not consistent for all datasets (Section 5.2).
This emerging sparsity indicates that a large portion of neurons are unnecessary in LLM inference (i.e.,
sparsity), which we can leverage to improve LLM inference efficiency like using MoEfication [49].
Recent papers [21, 49] show that a single FFN layer in pretrained LLMs can be converted to an MoE
layer, by splitting the matrices of FFN layers into exclusive sub-matrices and employing a router to
activate only neurons in a subset of experts. Similar to MoE models, MoEfication can effectively
accelerate LLM inference by only using part of the parameters [49, 21].

Model Weight Sparsity. Another orthogonal direction regarding model sparsity is static model
weight sparsity [8, 36], which often prunes the model weights and keeps them static during inference.
For instance, Wanda [36] estimates model weight importance and prunes unimportant weights, so all
inputs will use the same subset of weights. In contrast, contextual sparse models select a different
subset of weights for different inputs. Nonetheless, model pruning can be applied to contextual sparse
models too, meaning a complementary optimization to contextual sparsity.

Background and Motivation

In this section, we first briefly introduce the MoEfication of FFN layers in transformers. Then, we
present a study on the limitation of applying noisy top-K Softmax routing in the Moefication setting.

3.1
Background: MoEfication

MoEfication [49] is a way to group neurons in FFN layers, thereby converting FFN layers to MoE
layers for better execution speedup. For a transformer whose hidden states and FFN intermediate
dimension are dmodel and dF F N, respectively, the FFN layers process the input as follows:

h = xW1 + b2
FFN(x) = σ(h)W2 + b2
where x ∈Rdmodel, W1, W2 are weight metrics, b1, b2 are biased term and σ is an activation function.
MoEfication aims to group dF F N neurons in the FFN intermediate layer into n experts. Then, a
router is trained for each FFN layer to select k experts (k < n), thus reducing activation load, to speed
up inference. A recent work, Deja Vu [21], uses a similar setting but treats each neuron as an expert.

However, SOTA MoEfication methods overlook the potential for further optimizing the activation
sparsity of LLMs. Besides, for LLMs employing soft activations such as GeLU [12] and SwiGLU [31],
MoEfication [49] proposes to replace soft activations with ReLU and fine-tune the model to improve
activation sparsity. Although recent works [49, 25] show that this replacement has a marginal impact
on model performance, we notice that this hypothesis is not widely applicable (Section 5.2).

3.2
Limitations of Noisy Top-K Softmax Routing

Figure 2: Models trained with noisy top-K Soft-
max routing experience severe accuracy drops,
even at very low levels of sparsity.

One potential solution to train and convert the
model into MoE layers is noisy top-K Softmax
routing [7, 33]. It selects k experts based on the
highest router outputs and then calculates Soft-
max values for these selected outputs. The out-
put of the MoE layer is determined by summing
the products of these softmax values with their
corresponding experts’ outputs. Additionally,
a small Gaussian noise is added to the router’s
outputs during training to encourage exploration
across different experts, which addresses the is-
sue of unselected experts being non-differentiable.

---Page Break---
To study the effectiveness of noisy top-K Softmax routing, we follow the standard MoEfication
setting [49] to form experts in FFN layers: we fine-tune a model on a downstream dataset and group
neurons into experts via parameter clustering. Subsequently, we integrate Softmax routers into models
and jointly train both the model and routers. As shown in Figure 2, we observe noticeable accuracy
drops even at very low sparsity levels. When diving into the expert scores produced by routers, we
observe a very biased expert score allocation: only one expert in an MoE layer has an expert score
close to 1, while other experts receive nearly 0 scores. This results in only one expert contributing to
the inference in each MoE layer, leading to performance drops.

A potential reason behind this biased allocation is that the sum of expert scores in Softmax routing is
constrained to 1. Unlike traditional MoE models, which typically select 1-2 experts [32, 7], MoEfied
models need to select a much larger number of experts [21, 49], but the sum of experts score is still 1;
this can complicate the allocation of the Softmax budget and cause a biased allocation.

Methodology: Learn To be Efficient

In this section, we present LTE (Learn To be Efficient) to learn more structured MoE in FFN layers
for fast inference. Specifically, we tackle two key challenges toward practical MoEfication for diverse
LLMs: (1) How to train routers more stably? (Section 4.2); and (2) How to select the right experts in
serving? (Section 4.2.2).

4.1
Experts Grouping

The first step of LTE is to group neurons in FFN layers to form experts. Expert grouping aims to
group neurons that are often activated together, thereby improving efficiency by reducing the total
number of activated neurons. Here, constructing too many experts (e.g., each neuron as an expert)
can significantly increase the cost, while too few can lead to poor model quality. Moreover, we need
to group neurons without a significant performance drop on the pre-trained model.

Following the previous work [49], we group 32 neurons as an expert in FFN layers, and use parameter
clustering to group MLP neurons into different experts. Fundamentally, in FFN layers, each neuron
is associated with a column of W1 (which is a dmodel vector). Parameter clustering first treats
the corresponding vector in W1 as the feature for a neuron, then applies the balanced K-Means
algorithm [23] to cluster neurons into n clusters. Each cluster has 32 neurons by default and will be
treated as an individual MoE expert.2 We also conduct an ablation study on other alternative grouping
strategies in Section 5.5.

4.2
Adaptive Expert Routing

4.2.1
Router Design

After constructing the experts, we need to decide on the right routing strategy. Similar to existing
MoE designs, we use a fully-connected layer as the router network. The input to the router is the
output of the preceding self-attention block, and the router output is the expert score for each expert.

Routing function. To address the biased expert score issue (Section 3.2), we employ the Sigmoid
function on router outputs to get expert scores. Unlike the Softmax function, the Sigmoid function
computes each expert score independently, which circumvents the biased expert score due to the
constraint on the sum of outputs in the Softmax function:

G(x)i = Sigmoid(x · Wg,i) =
1
1 + e−x·Wg,i ,
(1)

where x is the input to the corresponding FFN layer, i is the index for the expert, and Wg,i is the
router network weight for the i-th expert.

Threshold-based experts selection. SOTA methods [49, 7] select a fixed number of experts for
all layers and inputs. However, the necessary number of experts may differ depending on inputs
and layers. Here, we propose to select experts more adaptively for different inputs and layers for a

2For FFN layers using SwiGLU (e.g., LLaMA), there are two linear networks to calculate neuron values:
SwiGLU(x) = (Swish(xW) ⊗xV )W2. We use the weight of the gate network, W, to cluster neurons.

---Page Break---
better trade-off between model sparsity and quality, by leveraging a threshold-based method to enable
adaptive selection. The MoEfied FFN layers become:

FFN(x) =

n
X

i=1
1{G(x)i>τ}(x)E(x)i,
(2)

where E(x)i is the output for the i-th expert, 1(·) is the indicator function, and τ is a predefined
threshold. Only experts with score larger than τ will be activated. Consequently, within the same
MoE layer, as the router generates larger expert scores, more experts are selected.

4.2.2
Two-stage LTE Training

Training the router poses three practical challenges. Firstly, as we consider training experts indepen-
dently to mitigate bias (e.g., using a Sigmoid routing function), it is difficult to tease apart important
experts from the rest. Secondly, the non-differentiability of threshold-based expert selection further
complicates router training. Lastly, setting thresholds for each MoE layer is non-trivial.

To tackle these challenges, we next propose a novel two-stage training algorithm with an efficiency
loss penalty to MoEfy LLMs. Our training algorithm consists of two training stages: a) model-router
training stage and b) model adaption stage.

Stage 1: Model-router training. In this stage, we jointly train routers and model parameters to
capture the importance of experts for given inputs in the Sigmoid routers. To address the non-
differentiability issue, we switch the expert selection to a “soft” mode:

FFNsoft(x) =

n
X

i=1
G(x)iE(x)i.
(3)

Instead of selecting a subset of experts, we always select all experts and multiply expert outputs
E(x)i with the corresponding expert score G(x)i to make both router and model differentiable. Since
there is no discrete selection in MoE layers, all parameters are trained for each iteration.

Figure 3: Expert distribution w/ and w/o sep-
arability loss. The expert scores in the model
trained with the separability loss are much
more separable than the model trained with-
out the separability loss.

Compared to Softmax routers, Sigmoid routers score
each expert independently and do not introduce any
competition on expert scores among experts. This
makes Sigmoid routers alone cannot identify more
important experts in MoE layers. As such, we design
an efficiency loss penalty, Lefficiency, to introduce
competition among experts for Sigmoid routers:

Lefficiency =
1
LN

L
X

l=1

N
X

i=1
|Gl(x)i|2,
(4)

where L is the number of layers, and N is the number
of experts in each layer. The efficiency loss calculates
the mean of expert scores across all layers. This
efficiency loss penalizes the output magnitudes of
routers, driving routers to selectively allocate lower
expert scores to less important experts, which helps
distinguish experts with different importance. Moreover, instead of assigning the same sparsity for
all layers, the efficiency loss also induces inter-layer orchestration, allowing LTE-trained models to
allocate adaptive sparsity for different layers. We show that LTE models are capable of adaptively
allocating sparsity across different layers (Figure 16).

For the threshold in Equation 2, instead of choosing a threshold for each router, we propose to select
a predetermined fixed threshold and then train models to fit this threshold, i.e., train models to be
threshold-aware. Specifically, we use a threshold separability regularizer to drive models to make
expert scores more separable for this given threshold:

Lseparability =
1
LN

L
X

l=1

N
X

i=1

1
(Gl(x)i −τ)2 ,
(5)

---Page Break---
where τ is a predefined threshold for all routers (we set τ = 0.5 for all experiments). The separability
loss encourages router outputs to diverge from the threshold τ, which makes the router outputs more
separable. An example is illustrated in Figure 3. The only difference between the models in the
two figures is if the model is trained with a separability loss. We find that the expert scores are
not separable when training without the separability loss, making it hard to decide the threshold.
However, training with the separability loss markedly improves the separability of expert scores,
allowing us to choose experts with the predefined threshold.

Combined with the task performance loss Ltask, our training loss in model-router training stage is:

Ls1 = Ltask + ηLefficiency + λLseparability.
(6)

The efficiency coefficient, η, is used to control the trade-off between inference efficiency and task
performance, and η can be used to control the sparsity of trained models. A higher η indicates a larger
inference cost penalty, leading to a more sparse model. λ is the separability loss, we set λ = 0.5 for
our evaluation. We conduct an ablation study on both hyperparameters in Section 5.5.

Stage 2: Model Adaptation. To accelerate model inference, we need to switch routers to discrete
selection mode (Equation 2), and the model trained in Stage 1 needs further training to adapt to the
changes in router outputs. In the model adaptation stage, we freeze the router parameters, switch
routers to discrete selection mode (Equation 2), and fine-tune the model to adapt to the discrete
routing with the task performance loss: Ls2 = Ltask.

Figure 4: Structural sparsity provided by LTE in FFN
layer. After selecting neurons, unselected rows and
columns won’t be loaded and used.

As illustrated in Figure 4, same as Deja
Vu [21] and moefication [49], LTE pro-
vides very structured sparsity. After se-
lecting neurons in intermediate layers, a
CUDA kernel needs only to load the rele-
vant columns and rows of Wup and Wdown
from GPU global memory to SRAM
to compute dot product, thus reducing
memory-I/O as well as computational over-
heads.
Thanks to the structured spar-
sity provided by LTE, the kernel avoids
non-coalesced memory access by storing
column-major Wup and row-major Wdown. In this paper, we use Triton 2.3.0 to implement a cus-
tomized MLP layer to translate the sparsity to wall-clock time latency reduction. The evaluation of
our custom kernel is presented in Section 5.3.

Experiment

In this section, we conduct extensive evaluationS to verify the effectiveness of LTE. For instance, in
Section 5.2, LLaMA with LTE provides a 1.83x - 2.59x FLOPs speed-up on NLG tasks. Along with
our hardware-aware custom kernel, LTE reduces 25% LLaMA2-7B inference latency at 50% sparsity.

5.1
Experimental Setting

Models. We implement LTE on both encoder-based models (RoBERTabase, RoBERTalarge) and
decoder-based models (GPT2-Medium, and LLaMA-7B) with the HuggingFace’s transformers.
Following previous work [49], we set each expert to contain 32 neurons in FFN layers for all models.

Datasets: 1) Natural Language Understanding (NLU): we evaluate on eight tasks from the GLUE
dataset [40] SST-2 [34], RTE [5], CoLA [42], MNLI [43], QNLI [29], QQP [13], STS-B [3], and
MPRC [6]. We report the Pearson correlation coefficient for STS-B, the Matthews correlation
coefficient for CoLA, and the accuracy for the other six datasets. 2) Natural Language Generation
(NLG): we evaluate LTE on E2E [27], XSum [26], and Wikitext103 [24]. For both E2E and
XSum, we report the ROUGE-L [19] to measure the generation text quality and report the perplexity
performance for the Wikitext dataset. 3) Instruction Tuning: besides downstream tasks, we also

6


---Page Break---
evaluate LTE on instruction tuning tasks to evaluate LTE’s generalization capabilities. We use
Tulu dataset [41] to perform instruction tunning with LTE, and we evaluate models with MMLU
benchmark [11]). MMLU benchmark is a comprehensive evaluation dataset designed to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of LLMs and consists of 15908 questions from 57 distinct tasks.

Baselines. We compare two baselines with LTE in our paper: (1) MoEfication [49]: MoEfication
proposes to replace soft activations with ReLU and then fine-tune the model on downstream datasets.
In our evaluation, we report the number of MoEfication with parameter clustering and ground-truth
expert selection. (2) Deja Vu [21]: Deja Vu employs predictors to estimate the values of neurons
in intermediate layers, pruning neurons with absolute magnitudes (absolute values for non-ReLU
activations). The models used in Deja Vu evaluation are models fine-tuned on specific tasks as well.

5.2
End-to-end Performance Comparison

Figure 5:
LTE consistently outperforms other
baselines on 4 NLU datasets.

LTE, MoEfication, and Deja Vu provide the
same type of structured sparsity in FFN lay-
ers. For the convenience of comparison, we use
FFN neuron sparsity as a measure of efficiency
in this section. We will further discuss how
our hardware-efficient implementation trans-
lates this sparsity into wall-clock time latency
reduction in Section 5.3. For our method (LTE),
we get models with different sparsity by tuning
efficiency loss η in Equation 6.

No performance drop with 80-95% sparsity
on NLU tasks. We first evaluate our methods
on eight NLU Tasks in GLUE datasets[40] with
two encoder-based models (RoBERTabase and
RoBERTalarge). Due to the space limit, we report
four datasets (MRPC, SST2, QNLI, and MNLI)
on RoBERTalarge in Figure 5 and other results in Figure 14 in Appendix C.

As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 14, our
method (LTE) consistently outperforms the base-
lines on all datasets. MoEfication exhibits a per-
formance drop when sparsity reaches 70%–80%,
and Deja Vu experiences performance drop at a
relatively low sparsity level (e.g., 30%), while
LTE maintains good performance even at higher
sparsity levels (>90%). Moreover, we notice
that while ReLU-based models achieve high
sparsity with a slight decrease in performance,
replacing GeLU with ReLU in RoBERTa can af-
fect performance on some datasets. For instance,
replacing GeLU with ReLU in a RoBERTa
model results in around 10% accuracy drop on the MRPC dataset.

50% FLOPs saving on NLG tasks. We next evaluate LTE with decoder-based models on three types
of generation tasks. Similar to NLU tasks, Figure 6 shows that LTE outperforms all other baselines.
NLG tasks are more challenging: all methods start to have a performance drop at a lower sparsity
level compared to NLU tasks. Yet, LTE-trained models have better resilience to the sparsity increase.
Especially at a high sparsity level, while other baselines fail to generate meaningful content, LTE
still generates content with a marginal quality drop. Similarly, we also observe the performance drop
caused by replacing soft activation with ReLU.

Additionally, to better understand the computation saving of LTE, we compare the FLOPs per token
of different methods on LLaMA-7B, allowing an up to 0.05 ROUGE-L decrease for XSum and E2E,
and an up to 0.5 perplexity (PPL) increase for WikiText-103. It is noteworthy that the FLOPs for
routers are included in our method, constituting approximately 1% of the total FLOPs of FFN layers.
The results are presented in Table 1. The evaluation results show that LTE provides a 1.83x - 2.59x
FLOPs speed-up and gives the most FLOPs savings among all methods.

LTE Outperforms SOTA on instruction tuning. To
further evaluate the effectiveness of LTE, we evaluate
LTE as a chatbot and verify model performance in
a few-shot learning scenario. We fine-tune LTE on
the Tulu instruction tunning dataset [41], and then
evaluate the few-shot performance on MMLU bench-
mark [11]. We use LLaMA2-7B as the base model
for LTE training. For a fair comparison, we also
fine-tune base models with the Tulu dataset for other
baselines. Specifically, for Deja Vu, we use Tulu-fine-
tuned LLaMA2-7B as the base model. For Moefi-
cation, we use Tulu-fine-tuned ReLULLaMA-7B as
the base model to ensure the best possible baseline
performance. We present the 5-shot MMLU accuracy
comparison in Figure 7. The evaluation results show
that LTE outperforms other baselines across all sparsity levels. Yet, LTE shows a weaker sparsity-
performance trade-off compared to downstream tasks. Our hypothesis is that LTE routers change
the structure of the original LLaMA model, which influences general language patterns learned by
models in pretraining. Instruction tuning alone is not enough to fully recover this ability (considering
instruction tuning has much smaller datasets). We believe that training with a wider variety of data
(like pretraining data) will further improve LTE performance.

sparsity. The evaluation results show that LTE achieves a lower perplexity than Wanda.

new memory allocations, slicing in Pytorch is very time-consuming. This makes indexed matrix
multiplication even slower than dense matrix multiplication at most sparsity levels. We report the
wall-clock time latency comparison in Figure 8 (noting that the router inference latency is already
included in LTE latency). Compared to a dense FFN block, our custom Triton kernel achieves nearly
linear speed-up with respect to sparsity (Left). At around 50% sparsity, LTE reduces end-to-end
generation latency by approximately 25%.

Addtional Comparison

Model pruning. As discussed in Section 2, besides dynamic contextual sparsity provided by LTE,
static sparsity provided by model pruning is also a common method to accelerate model inference.
In this section, we present a performance comparison between Wanda [36] and LTE in Table 2.
The sparsity reported here is the overall sparsity of the entire model, which is different from the
FFN sparsity reported in Seciton 5.2. For LTE, we recalculate the overall sparsity based on the
FFN sparsity. The evaluation results show that LTE achieves a lower perplexity than Wanda. The
evaluation results show that, given a similar sparsity, LTE achieves better perplexity.

Experts grouping algorithms. Three different expert grouping algorithms are explored in [49]:
random grouping, parameter K-means clustering, and co-activation graph split. The co-activation
graph split algorithm constructs a graph where each neuron represents a node and the edges denote the
frequency of co-activation between neuron pairs. This graph is subsequently divided into subgraphs
using the graph split algorithm [16], with each subgraph representing a group of neurons. To study the
effectiveness of these grouping algorithms, we compare their LTE performance by fine-tuning GPT2
on the WikiText-103 dataset. As shown in Figure 9, both co-activation graph split and parameter
K-means grouping have very similar performance (similar to finding in [49]) and outperform random
grouping. Given that parameter K-means grouping is simpler to implement, as co-activation graph
split requires collecting activation data, we use K-means grouping in our paper.

The relation between efficiency loss hyperparameter η and sparsity. As discussed in Section 4.2.2,
efficiency loss hyperparameter η is used to balance the trade-off between task performance and
sparsity (efficiency). We illustrate the relation between η and sparsity across different models and
tasks in Figure 10. For a given task and model, increasing η results in greater sparsity.

tates us to choose the threshold to pick
neurons (as shown in Figure 3). We
compare models trained with different
lambda in Figure 11. When increasing
λ from 0 (i.e., no separability loss) to
0.5, we observe a constant perplexity
drop for all sparsity. However, if we
keep increasing λ, perplexity does not
further decrease.

Effectiveness of LTE-trained routers. We next demon-
strate the effectiveness of LTE’s first training stage, the
model-router training stage, in helping LLMs gain bet-
ter sparsity. To build a baseline, instead of using routers
trained in the model-router training stage, we use randomly
initialized networks as routers and train LLMs to adapt
to random routers. Since we cannot control the sparsity
of LLMs with a threshold in a random router, we decide
the sparsity for MoE layers by picking K top experts: we
first fix a K to decide the sparsity and then start to train the
model. Figure 12 compares the performance of models
with different routers. We observe that routers trained with
LTE significantly contribute to achieving a better trade-off
between sparsity and model performance, which proves
the effectiveness of the model-router training stage.

Other baselines with further fine-tuning. A key distinc-
tion between LTE and other baselines is that LTE requires
additional fine-tuning to make the model efficiency-aware.
In this section, we assess whether further fine-tuning can
enhance the performance of other baselines, aiming to understand the contribution of additional
training to LTE’s effectiveness. Specifically, we fine-tune two baselines on GPT2-Medium using the
WikiText103 dataset: 1) we first fine-tune GPT2-M with Wikitext and apply Deja Vu on the fine-tuned
models. Then, we further fine-tune MoEfied models with WikiText103. 2) We implement σ-MoE [4]
on GPT2-Medium model and fine-tune models with the WikiText103 dataset. For both baselines,
we train models for the same training time as we train LTE models. The evaluation results shown in
Figure 13 show that LTE outperforms the other two baselines across different sparsity levels.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore how to enable better activation sparsity for fast LLM inference. We
introduce a novel algorithm, LTE, for the model to automatically learn to activate fewer neurons,
by grouping neurons into different experts and then adaptively selecting important ones for specific
inputs and layers. Our extensive evaluations, spanning four LLMs and eleven datasets, show that
LTE can achieve 1.83x - 2.59x FLOPs speed-up on LLaMA, thus execution efficiency, outperforming
state-of-the-art designs. We believe that our work can inspire more research on designing more
efficiency-aware training methods, making LLMs more accessible to the broad community.

Broader Impact

This paper presents the Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE) algorithm to accelerate the LLM inference. A
more efficient LLM inference can significantly enhance the accessibility and sustainability of LLMs.
By reducing computational demands, it addresses environmental concerns through lower energy
consumption and helps democratize access to advanced AI technologies. We believe that our work
can better help smaller organizations, educational institutions, and researchers, who previously faced
barriers due to resource limitations, access LLMs more easily. To sum up, the LTE algorithm not only
advances the field technically but also broadens the scope of AI’s benefits to a wider, more inclusive
community.

Limitations

While LTE outperforms other baselines, LTE needs further fine-tuning to get contextual sparse models.
(Yet, training is a one-time investment that yields long-term benefits for LLM serving.) A future
study is to combine LTE with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to reduce LTE training
overhead. Another limitation is our computational resource, which prevents us from training LTE on
pretraining or RLHF. As discussed in Section 5.2, we believe that training with a wider variety of
data will further improve LTE performance. We leave this for future exploration.

Experiment Settings

We presented all training hyperparameters in Table 3, 4, 5, and 6. For hyperparameters presented in
{}, we select the best hyperparameter for each task. We follow the settings in RoBERTa paper [20]
to fine-tune RoBERTa on GLUE datasets. We set the coefficient for the separability loss (λ in
Equation 6) to be 0.5 for all stage 1 training. We use different η to control the sparsity of trained
models (Figure 10). Hardware: All models are trained and evaluated on A100, A40, and 3090Ti,
depending on memory usage and availability.

Additional Evaluation Results

C.1
NLU Performance Comparison

In Figure 14, we present the evaluation results of the rest four NLU datasets. We have similar
findings as we discussed in Section 5.2: LTE achieves a better trade-off between sparsity and task
performance. However, we notice that, LTE outperforms MoEfication on the CoLA dataset, but has
worse performance than KLA at low sparsity level. The size of CoLA is relatively small and may not
be efficient for models to learn good routers.

w.r.t. batch size.

Contextual Sparsity for Larger Batches. Similar to previous
contextual sparsity work [21], we observe that as the batch size
increases, more neurons are activated, leading to a reduction
in union sparsity. These dynamics are illustrated in Figure15.
Similar to Deja Vu [21], the number of activated neurons does
not grow linearly with the batch size, indicating a non-uniform
distribution of parameter access from different inputs. This
property can extend LTE for a high-throughput batch setting by
batching inputs activating similar neurons together to achieve
a high union sparsity.

Adaptive Sparsity across Layers. Instead of assigning a fixed
sparsity to each layer, LTE uses the efficiency loss to introduce
competition across different layers to allocate the computation budget to more important layers. Here,
we conduct a study on the distribution of sparsity across layers in models trained with LTE. As
shown in Figure 16, we observe that LTE achieves different sparsity levels across different layers.
For example, the MRPC (RoBERTabase) model with 0.46 sparsity has 0.2 sparsity at layer 2, but has
more than 0.8 sparsity at layers 10 and 11.

Figure 16:
Sparsity across different layers.
We present the sparsity of different layers in an
encoder-based model (RoBERTabase) for MRPC
and a decoder-based model (GPT2-M) for Wiki-
Text103. Different layers learn to have different
sparsity, and RoBERTabase and GPT2-M have dif-
ferent sparsity patterns across layers.

Another intriguing finding is that RoBERTabase
and GPT2-M have very different sparsity pat-
terns. In RoBERTa, the sparsity of MoE layers
significantly increases with depth, contrasting
with GPT2-M, where MoE layer sparsity de-
creases as layer depth increases. This difference
can stem from differences in the design of these
two transformers and tasks. Given that MRPC
is a sentence classification task, encoder-based
transformers like RoBERTa primarily rely on the
"[CLS]" token for classification. Consequently,
other tokens become less important in deeper
layers, allowing sparser FFN layers. In contrast,
GPT2, a decoder-based transformer designed
for language generation, requires all tokens to
generate the next token. Furthermore, recent
research [10] on interpretability suggests that deeper FFN layers store more complex semantic
information, which may drive deep FFN layers to be less sparse.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims in the abstract and introduction accurately summarize the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the limitations of our work in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: No theory is included in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We introduced detailed implementation details and hyperparameters used in
the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

19


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We upload the code in the Supplementary files.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduced detailed implementation details and hyperparameters used in
the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Training LLMs incurs significant costs. To ensure the reliability of our evalua-
tion and avoid the potential bias of cherry-picking results, we employ entirely random seeds.
Furthermore, the consistency of our conclusions across multiple models and benchmarks can
also be treated as a form of repeated evaluation and support the robustness of our findings.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

20


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We introduced compute resources used in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we check that our paper conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We included broader impacts in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

21


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No model or dataset is released in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the license for the used code and datasets in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

22


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
