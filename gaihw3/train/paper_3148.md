Abstract

Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on test-
1

ing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks
2

with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evalua-
3

tion direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically
4

without any human feedback. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source
5

LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and
6

evaluating each other, where each LLM’s response score is jointly determined
7

by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models,
8

we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking.
9

We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the
10

consistency of each LLM’s capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is
11

that high-level LLM can evaluate others’ answers more accurately than low-level
12

ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover,
13

we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning
14

human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics,
15

validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Introduction

Goodhart’s Law: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
18

measure.”
19

Large language models (LLMs)[11, 2, 12, 43] have achieved remarkable success across a variety
20

of real-world applications [54, 32, 36, 52]. With the increasingly widespread application of these
21

models, there is an urgent need for an effective evaluation method to ensure that their performance
22

and usability meet the growing demands. To assess the ability level of LLMs, a large number of
23

evaluation benchmarks have been proposed by using some small and domain-specific datasets with
24

human-curated labels, such as MMLU [26], HELM [30], Big-Bench[39], GLUE[45]. However, these
25

benchmarks can only measure LLMs’ core capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g. multi-choice
26

knowledge or retrieval questions), which fails to assess their alignment with human preference in
27

open-ended tasks adequately [16, 28, 34]. On the other hand, these evaluations may suffer from
28

benchmark leakage issue, referring that the evaluation data is unknowingly used for model training,
29

which can also lead to misleading evaluations [49, 56]. Therefore, blindly improving scores on
30

these public benchmarks cannot always yield a large language model that truly satisfies human
31

requirements.
32

For assessing human preferences, recent studies have focused on building crowdsourced battle
33

platforms with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric. Typical platforms include Chatbot
34

Arena [55], MT-Bench [55], and AlpacaEval [29]. It constructs anonymous battles between chatbots
35

in real-world scenarios, where users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and
36

rate their responses based on personal preferences. While human evaluation is the gold standard for

Figure 1: The framework of PiCO. In this framework, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same
environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM’s response
score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. We assign each LLM a learnable capability weight to
optimize the score ranking based on the consistency assumption, while reducing the entropy of the peer-review
evaluation system. The consistency optimization aims to find a final score ranking that all LLMs “agree” it.

measuring human preferences, it is exceptionally slow and costly[55]. In addition, adding a new
38

LLM to the crowdsourced battle platforms also poses a cold-start issue [15]. Thus, a fundamental
39

question arises: can we construct an unsupervised LLMs evaluation system without relying on any
40

human feedback?
41

Actually, in real human evaluation systems, people build their ability hierarchy based on different
42

empirical assumptions. For example, majority voting [22, 10, 40] and rating voting [5] methods
43

are widely used during the decision-making process, which are based on the wisdom of the crowds
44

[40, 13, 50] and have been proven to lead to better results than that of an individual. Moreover, in
45

the established practice of peer-review in academic research, scholars evaluate their academic level
46

rankings based on the consistency assumption, i.e., scholars with stronger abilities have stronger
47

persuasiveness for evaluating others, and can also obtain higher achievements. This paper attempts to
48

explore whether similar phenomena exist in the LLMs evaluation systems.
49

In this work, we propose PiCO, a Peer review approach in LLMs based on Consistency Optimization.
50

In this setting, LLMs themselves act as “reviewers”, engaging in mutual assessments to achieve
51

comprehensive, efficient, and performance evaluations without relying on manually annotated data.
52

This method aims to address the limitations of existing evaluation approaches and provide insights
53

into LLMs’ real-world capabilities. As shown in Figure 1, both open-source and closed-source
54

LLMs lie in the same environment and answer the open-ended questions from an unlabeled dataset.
55

Then, we construct anonymous answer pairs, while randomly selecting other LLMs as “reviewers” to
56

evaluate both responses with a learnable confidence weight w. Finally, we employ this weight and
57

calculate the response scores G for each LLM based on the weighted joint evaluation. It is worth
58

noting that the whole peer-review process works in an unsupervised way, and our goal is to optimize
59

the confidence weights that re-rank the LLMs to be closer to human rankings.
60

To achieve this, we formalize it as a constrained optimization based on the consistency assumption. We
61

maximize the consistency of each LLM’s capability w and score G while adjusting the final ranking
62

to align with human preference more closely. The key assumption behind this is that high-level LLM
63

can evaluate others’ answers more accurately (confidence) than low-level ones, while higher-level
64

LLM can also achieve higher answer-ranking scores. As a result, the entropy (controversy) of the
65

whole peer-review evaluation system can be minimized. In other words, the consistency optimization
66

aims to find a final score ranking that all LLMs have no “disputes” regarding.
67

To evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings, we propose three metrics called PEN (Permutation
68

Entropy), CIN (Count Inversions), LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence). The experiments are
69

conducted on multiple crowdsourcing datasets and validated on these three metrics. The experimental
70

results demonstrate that the proposed PiCO framework can effectively obtain a large language models’
71

leaderboard closer to human preferences.

The Proposed Approach
83

In this section, we first describe the problem definition and preference alignment evaluation, and then
84

introduce the proposed PiCO framework in detail.
85

2.1
Definition and Metrics
86

Problem Definition. In this subsection, we aim to measure the ability level of LLMs automatically
87

without relying on human annotations. Thus we consider an unsupervised LLM evaluation scenario
88

with an unlabeled dataset Q consisting of n open-ended questions, where Q = {Qi}n
i=1. In addition,
89

we have a large language model pool M = {Mj}m
j=1, which includes both open-source and closed-
90

source models. Write M1 ≻M2 to indicate that the LLM M1 has stronger capabilities than the LLM
91

M2. Thus, we can assume that the ground-truth ranking R∗alignment with human preferences,
92

R∗:= [M1 ≻M2 ≻M3 ≻... ≻Mm],
(1)

and assume that the learned ranking ˆR by different evaluation methods is as follows,
93

ˆR := [M3 ≻M1 ≻M2 ≻... ≻Mm].
(2)

The goal is to build an LLM ranking ˆR that aligns with human ranking R∗, making the loss L of the
94

both rankings tend towards 0, i.e., L( ˆR, R∗) →0
95

Preference Alignment Metrics. Before building LLM rankings, we first need to discuss how to
96

evaluate aligned human rankings. Intuitively, the metrics we want mainly describe the differences
97

between two arrays composed of ranking indices. Assuming that human ranking R∗is defined as
98

being well-ranked in ascending order ([1, 2, 3, ..., m]) as shown in Eq 1. Thus the metric is to quantify
99

the randomness of the learned ranking array ([3, 1, 2, ..., m]) as shown in Eq 2. Based on this, we
100

propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS, respectively.
101

PEN (Permutation Entropy). Permutation entropy [8] is a concept used to quantify the complexity or
102

randomness of time series data. It provides a measure of the irregularity or unpredictability of the
103

order of values in a sequence. We thus utilize it to measure the gap with human rankings as follows,
104

LP EN( ˆR, R∗) := −
X
p(π) log p(π),
(3)

where
105

p(π) = #{t|0 ≤t ≤m −k, (Mt+1, ..., Mt+k) ∈π}

m −k + 1
.

Figure 3: The pipeline of the PiCO. It is mainly composed of two components: the peer-review and consistency
optimization stages. Specifically, in the peer-review stage, the unlabeled dataset Q and the LLMs pool M are
given. Then, we let all LLMs answer each unlabeled question to obtain the response set A. We shuffle the set
and construct anonymous answer pairs, while randomly selecting other LLMs to evaluate both responses with a
learnable confidence w. As a result, we can obtain the answer-ranking data D which is a quadruple that records
the partial order between two answers and the evaluator’s confidence weight. In the consistency optimization
stage, we update the parameter w by maximizing the consistency of each LLM’s capability and score, while
re-ranking the LLMs to be closer to human rankings.

π denotes different permutations, k is a hyper-parameter recommended to be set to 3 to 7, and we
106

set k = 3 in this paper. Intuitively, it samples some subsequences and calculates the entropy for all
107

permutation types. And the lower the permutation entropy in the learned LLM rankings, the closer it
108

is to the ground-truth human rankings.
109

CIN (Count Inversions). Counting inversions [27] aims to measure the degree of disorder or
110

"invertedness" in an array or sequence of elements. We thus define it as follows,
111

LCIN( ˆR, R∗) :=
X

Mi,Mj∼M
1{Mi ≻Mj ∧i < j}.
(4)

Where 1{·} is the indicator function that the value is 1 when the condition is met, otherwise it is 0.
112

Intuitively, the fewer inverse pairs in the learned LLM rankings, the closer it is to the ground-truth
113

human rankings.
114

LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence). The longest increasing subsequence aims to find the length
115

of the longest subsequence in a given sequence of elements, where the subsequence is in increasing
116

order. We utilize it to measure the degree of match with human rankings as follows,
117

LLIS( ˆR, R∗) := max {dp[i] | 1 ≤i ≤m} ,
(5)

where
118

dp[i] = 1 + max {dp[j] | 1 ≤j < i ∧Mj ≺Mi} .
dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with Mi. LIS allows for
119

a nuanced understanding of the degree to which the learned ranking aligns with the ideal human
120

ranking, with a higher LIS length indicating greater alignment.
121

2.2
Algorithm Details
122

The PiCO framework, depicted in Figure 3, involves peer-review and consistency optimization stages.
123

In the peer-review stage, we first collect an unlabeled dataset Q consisting of open-ended questions,
124

and construct a large language model pool M that includes both open-source and closed-source
125

LLMs. Then, we let all LLMs answer each unlabeled question to obtain the response set A. We
126

shuffle the set and construct anonymous answer pairs, while randomly selecting other LLMs as
127

“reviewers” to evaluate both responses with a learnable confidence w. Finally, we can obtain the
128

answer-ranking data D and calculate the response score G for each large language model. In the
129

consistency optimization phase, we maximize the consistency of each LLM’s capability w and score
130

G with constrained optimization, while re-ranking the LLMs to be closer to human rankings.
131

2.2.1
Peer Review Stage
132

Data Collection and LLMs Pool Construction. Benefiting from the creation of crowdsourced
133

battle platforms, we accessed open assessment datasets from Chatbot Arena[55], MT-Bench[55],
134

4


---Page Break---
and AlpacaEval[29].
These open datasets include critical fields such as "question_id" and
135

"question_content." Utilizing the Chatbot Arena dataset, which features pairwise data from twenty
136

LLMs with human preference annotations, we assembled an LLM pool M = {Mj}m
j=1. Leveraging
137

33K human-annotated interactions from this dataset, we established a ground-truth ranking R∗and
138

gathered responses A = {{Aj
i}n
i=1}m
j=1 for our dataset Q = {Qi}n
i=1.
139

Answer-Ranking Data Construction Based on Peer Review. After obtaining the responses set A,
140

we aim to generate answer-ranking data D through the peer-review mechanism. Specifically, for the
141

same question Qi ∈Q, we randomly construct a battle pair < Aj
i, Ak
i > for review. Each battle pair
142

will be randomly assigned five models (“reviewers”) to determine the winners or declare ties. Note
143

that the model may evaluate its own answers, but the entire process is anonymous. As a result, we
144

can obtain the quadruples (Aj
i, Ak
i , > ws), indicating the “reviewer” Ms believes that the answer Aj
i
145

is better than answer Ak
i with a confidence ws. Therefore, the answer-ranking data D can be defined
146

as follows,
147

D =
n
(Aj
i, Ak
i , >, ws)
o

i∼Q,j,k,s∼M ,
(6)

where i denotes the question index, and j, k, s indicate the model indices. ws is a learnable confidence
148

of model Ms, and > is a partial order relationship from {>, <, =}.
149

2.2.2
Consistency Optimization Stage
150

As shown in Eq 6, following the peer-review mechanism, we construct anonymous answer pairs and
151

randomly select other LLMs as “reviewers” to evaluate both responses with a learnable confidence w.
152

Next, we expect to optimize the confidence w and re-rank the LLMs to be closer to human rankings.
153

We thus propose the consistency assumption, i.e., high-level LLM can evaluate others’ answers
154

more accurately (confidence) than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher
155

answer-ranking scores. Formally, we maximize the consistency of each LLM’s capability w and
156

score G with constrained optimization as follows,
157

argmax
w
Consistency(G, w)
(7)

s.t. Gj =
X

(Aj
i ,Ak
i ,>,ws)∼D
1{Aj
i > Ak
i } ∗ws,

where 1{·} is the indicator function that the value is 1 when the condition is met, otherwise, it is 0.
158

Gj denotes the response score of model Mj, which is calculated by joint evaluation of other models.
159

Moreover, we employ Pearson correlation [38] to measure the consistency between w and G. Note
160

that we only introduce this straightforward implementation to validate our idea of PiCO. Other more
161

advanced strategies may be employed to further improve the performance.
162

Discussion: It is worth noting that the whole process (Eq. 6 and 7) works in an unsupervised way.
163

The only thing we do is to adaptively assign each LLM a score that matches its abilities. An intuitive
164

example is as follows: in a real peer-review system, if the academic level of three scholars a, b, and c
165

satisfies the following relationship, wa > wb > wc. So, in the ultimate ideal scenario, the ranking
166

of the scores submitted by these three scholars should also be, Ga > Gb > Gc. In other words, the
167

sorting of G and w satisfies high consistency. On the other hand, scholars with stronger abilities (i.e.,
168

scholar a) evaluate Ab > Ac have stronger persuasiveness, so scholar b should also receive higher
169

weighted scores 1 ∗wa.
170

Reviewer Elimination Mechanism. Realizing that not all LLMs have sufficient ability to evaluate
171

the responses of other models. We thus introduce an unsupervised elimination mechanism to remove
172

those LLMs that have low scores. It iteratively removes the lowest-scoring LLM from the “reviewer
173

queue” for the next consistency optimization stage, until 60% of models are eliminated. The whole
174

process of the approach is summarized in Algorithm 1, and the details can be found in Appendix D.
175

Experiments
176

Datasets. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we perform experiments on Chatbot
177

Arena[55], MT-Bench[55], and AlpacaEval[29]. The MT-Bench dataset assesses six LLMs’ responses
178

to 80 multi-category questions. The Chatbot Arena Conversations Dataset, with 33K conversations
179

from 13K IPs during April-June 2023, evaluates real dialogue performance. AlpacaEval dataset

LLMs Pool. In our experiments, we employ 15 LLMs with diverse architectures to construct the
185

LLMs pool, including GPT-3.5-Turbo[35], WizardLM-13B[51], Guanaco-33B[1], Vicuna-7B[16],

188

All models use the same evaluation template, they can be found in Appendix B
189

Baselines. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed PiCO approach, we compare the following
190

methods in the experiments.
191

• The wisdom of the crowds: The two methods that perform LLMs evaluation based on the
192

wisdom of the crowds [40, 13, 50] are compared in this experiment. 1) Majority Voting
193

[40]: Multiple review models vote for the better answer for the same response pair, and the
194

model with the most votes gets 1 score; 2) Rating Voting [5]: Multiple review models also
195

vote on the same response pair, and the number of votes obtained is the score.
196

• State-of-the-art methods: The four recent SOTA methods of using either single or multiple
197

models for self-evaluation are compared in this experiment. PandaLM[46]: It is a fine-tuned
198

language model based on Llama-7b designed for the preference judgment tasks to evaluate
199

and optimize LLMs. GPTScore[23]: It employs generative pre-trained models to assess the
200

quality of generated text. It calculates the likelihood that the text was generated in response
201

to specific instructions and context, indicative of high quality. In our implementation, GPT-3
202

(davinci-002) and flan-t5-xxl serve as the base models. PRD[28]: It transforms the LLMs
203

win rates into weights for competitive ranking, while evaluating each LLM based on its
204

preference for all possible pairs of answers, enabling a tournament-style ranking system.
205

PRE[17]: It employs a supervised process to evaluate LLMs using a qualification exam,
206

aggregates their scores based on accuracy, and assigns weights accordingly. PiCO (Ours):
207

the proposed approach in this paper.
208

Metrics. For all experiments, we employ three metrics to evaluate the aforementioned experimental
209

setups and our Peer Review method: PEN, CIN, and LIS. Moreover, we perform the experiments for
210

4 runs and record the average results over 4 seeds (seed = 1, 2, 3, 4).

3.1
Performance Comparison
212

We validate the effectiveness of the proposed PiCO method on three datasets by comparing the
213

following two types of methods, i.e., the wisdom of the crowds and recent SOTA LLMs evaluation
214

methods. The average results of PEN, CIN and LIS are demonstrated in Table 1. The ratios of
215

response sets D are 1, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively.
216

The results presented in Table 1 illustrate the proposed PiCO method consistently surpasses com-
217

peting approaches across the majority of evaluated metrics Notably, PiCO achieves performance
218

improvements of 0.1, 2.5, and 0.92 on the PEN, CIN, and LIS metrics, respectively, compared to the
219

Runner-up. These results underscore the superiority of aggregating evaluations from multiple models,
220

such as Majority Voting, Rating Voting, PRD, and PRE, as opposed to relying solely on single-model
221

methods like GPTScore and PandaLM. This collective model approach, leveraging ’the wisdom of
222

the crowds’, more accurately aligns with human rankings in our open-question evaluation framework.
223

In comparison with existing peer review evaluation methods(i.e., PRD and PRE), it is evident that
224

PiCO exhibits improvements across various evaluation metrics. Despite PRD’s adjustment of model
225

weights based on their win rates and PRE’s reliance on supervised human feedback data to assign
226

weights through a qualification exam, neither method achieves performance superior to the fully
227

unsupervised PiCO approach. These methods rely on predefined criteria and human feedback,
228

potentially leading to biases or suboptimal performance. In contrast, PiCO leverages unsupervised
229

learning techniques, allowing it to autonomously adapt and discover patterns in the data without
230

explicit human intervention.
231

It is important to highlight that PandaLM, a language model equipped with 7 billion parameters, was
232

fine-tuned using labels generated by GPT-3.5-turbo as the ground truth, achieving stable performance
233

across various datasets. However, in our unsupervised, open-ended experimental setup, which focuses
234

on ranking-based metrics, GPTScore exhibits less robustness regardless of whether the base model is
235

GPT-3 (davinci-002) or flan-t5-xx.
236

3.2
Exploring the Role of Confidence Weight
237

In this subsection, we will show that the confidence weight w learned by our consistency optimization
238

can reduce the system evaluation bias. Specifically, we first study whether the “review” model would

Figure 5: Performance comparison of the PiCO (Ours) and PRE[17] methods on the Chatbot Arena, MT-Bench,
and AlpacaEval datasets, with the number of eliminated reviewers on the x-axis. The y-axis is CIN, where lower
values indicate better performance.

prefer a particular model’s response. Following [17], we employ the preference gap (PG) to evaluate
240

the bias as follows,
241
PG(i, j) = Pi(i > j) −Pj(i > j),
(8)

where Pi(i > j) represents the winning rate of model i as the “reviewer” believes that i defeated
242

j. The heatmap distribution of the PG value PG(i, j) among seven LLMs across three datasets is
243

demonstrated in the first row of Figure 4. It can be observed that the evaluation system exhibits severe
244

bias. Especially on ChatGLM-6B and Mpt-7B models, they often believe that their results are better
245

than other ones, as their PG values are greater than 0 across three datasets.
246

After the consistency optimization, we assign the learned confidence weight w to the corresponding
247

model and ultimately obtain the re-weighting PG value ˆ
PG(i, j) as follows,
248

ˆ
PG(i, j) = wi × Pi(i > j) −wj × Pj(i > j).
(9)

The results of the re-weighting PG value ˆ
PG(i, j) are displayed on the second row of Figure 4. It can
249

be observed that the learned confidence weight w can significantly mitigate the preference gaps of the
250

whole evaluation system. In our consistency optimization, LLMs such as ChatGLM-6B and Mpt-7B
251

have lower weights, and reducing their confidence can effectively alleviate the system evaluation bias.
252

3.3
Study of Elimination Mechanism
253

The PiCO and PRE[17] methods both employ elimination mechanisms to remove those weakest
254

LLMs from the “reviewer queue” during the evaluation process. As shown in Figure 5, the x-axis
255

quantifies the number of reviewers eliminated, and the y-axis measures the CIN, where lower scores
256

denote higher performance. Due to space limitations, more results on PEN and LIS metrics can be
257

found in Appendix E. It can be observed that both PiCO and PRE exhibit better performance with
258

an increasing number of eliminated “reviewers”. The proposed PiCO approach can achieve better
259

performance than PRE in most cases. It is worth noting that the PRE method employs the accuracy
260

of “qualification exams” to eliminate weak LLMs, and this process requires human annotation [17].
261

On the contrary, the elimination process of our PiCO method is unsupervised and can still achieve
262

better evaluation results than PRE.
263

3.4
Validation of Consistency Assumption
264

In this subsection, we conduct the ablation study to validate the effectiveness of the consistency
265

assumption. Specifically, we first manually construct three methods: Forward Weight Voting,
266

Uniform Weight Voting, and Reverse Weight Voting. That is, the ability weights of the model are
267

respectively weighted forward (w = [1, 0.9, ..., 0]), uniformly (w = [1, 1, ..., 1]), and backward
268

(w = [0, 0.1, ..., 1]) according to the ground-truth human ranking. Then, we randomly initialize the
269

ability weights and employ our consistency optimization to adjust the weight. In addition, we also
270

collect the average performance of “reviewer queue”, i.e., employing a single LLM as the “reviewer”
271

to evaluate all response pairs and then calculate the average results of all LLMs.
272

As shown in Table 2, it can be observed that the Forward Weight Voting achieves better results than
273

the Uniform and Backward ones in all cases, while the Backward one achieves worse results. It
274

validates that assigning larger weights to those models with stronger capabilities can obtain better
275

results. Most importantly, employing our consistency optimization algorithm to assign weights to
276

different review models can further improve the performance of the evaluation system, i.e., lower PEN
277

and CIN, as well as higher LIS in all cases. Moreover, it is worth noting that the average performance
278

of the “reviewer queue” is very poor, even worse than the Backward Weight Voting. This means
279

that the answer-ranking data D contains a lot of evaluation noise, while the proposed approach can
280

still optimize weights and obtain better ranking results. In summary, the above experimental results
281

validate the effectiveness of the consistency assumption from various perspectives.

283

Evaluation Benchmarks for Diversity. LLMs are designed to handle a variety of tasks, necessitat-
284

ing comprehensive benchmarks[15]. Notable benchmarks include GLUE[45] and SuperGLUE[44],
285

which simulate real-world scenarios across tasks such as text classification, translation, reading
286

comprehension, and dialogue generation. HELM[30] provides a holistic evaluation of LLMs, as-
287

sessing language understanding, generation, coherence, and reasoning. BIG-bench[39] pushes LLM
288

capabilities with 204 diverse tasks. MMLU[26] measures multitask accuracy across domains like
289

mathematics and law. However, these evaluations can be compromised by benchmark leakage, where
290

evaluation data inadvertently used for training leads to inflated performance metrics[4, 56].
291

Human Evaluation. Human evaluation provides reliable feedback that closely aligns with real-
292

world applications[15]. Liang et al.[30] evaluated summary and misinformation scenarios across
293

multiple models. Ziems et al.[57] involved experts to assess model outputs in various domain-specific
294

tasks. Bang et al.[9] examined ChatGPT’s performance in summarization, translation, and reasoning
295

using human-annotated datasets. The LMSYS initiative introduced platforms like Chatbot Arena[55],
296

relying on human ratings as the primary evaluation metric. Despite its effectiveness, human evaluation
297

is costly and subject to bias and cultural differences[37].
298

Large Language Models for Evaluation. The development of open-source LLMs has led to the
299

use of LLMs as evaluators. GPTScore[23] uses models like GPT-3 to assign probabilities to high-
300

quality content through multidimensional evaluation. Bubeck et al.[12] tested GPT-4, finding it
301

rivaling human capabilities. Lin and Chen introduced LLM-EVAL[31] for evaluating dialogue quality
302

with single prompts. PandaLM[46] employs LLMs as "judges" for evaluating instruction tuning.
303

However, reliance on a single model can introduce biases such as positional[20], verbosity[47], and
304

self-favoring biases[33, 55]. ChatEval[14] proposes a multi-agent framework to simulate human
305

evaluation processes. Similarly, PRE[17] and PRD[28] use LLMs as evaluators, combining multiple
306

evaluation outcomes for automated assessment. However, the PRE method, which relies on human
307

feedback for supervised evaluation throughout the process, still incurs relatively high costs.
308

Conclusion
309

In this paper, we propose the novel Peer Review method based on the Consistency Optimization
310

(PiCO) to automatically evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on human feedback.
311

PiCO utilizes peer-review mechanisms to autonomously assess LLMs in a shared environment, where
312

both open-source and closed-source models can respond to unlabeled questions and evaluate each
313

other. In this setup, each LLM’s response score is determined collectively by other anonymous
314

models, aiming to maximize consistency across capabilities and scores. We propose three metrics,
315

i.e., PEN, CIN, and LIS, to quantify the disparity from human preferences. The extensive experiment
316

results across multiple datasets and metrics demonstrate that PiCO effectively generates an LLM
317

leaderboard that aligns closely with human preferences. In the future, we plan to extend the peer-
318

review mechanism to evaluate the capabilities of multi-modality large models.

A
Dataset Format
475

Focusing on the MT-Bench dataset, we demonstrate the ensuing data format utilizing dataset Q.
476

As Figure 6 illustrates, the Question dataset Q contains "Question id," "Category," "Question,"
477

and "Reference." In categories with definitive answers like "reasoning" or "math," the "Reference"
478

field is populated with standard answers; otherwise, it remains blank. Each model M in our pool
479

processes the Question dataset Q to generate the LLMs answer data A, consisting of "Question
480

id," "Answer id," "Model id," and "Answer." Finally, we combine pairs in A and appoint judges to
481

evaluate, creating the Answer-Ranking data D, featuring "Question id," "Model 1," "Model 2," "G1
482

winner," "G2 winner," and "Judge." Here, "G1 winner" and "G2 winner" indicate the outcomes of
483

inputting reversed order responses of Model 1 and Model 2 into the judge model, a method employed
484

to mitigate biases stemming from models’ preferences for input order.

Detailed Prompt for Reviewers
486

The evaluation prompts, as detailed in Section 2.2.1, are employed during the Peer Review Stage.
487

These prompts are provided to the Reviewer Language Model Systems (LLMs), enabling them to
488

generate evaluative preferences. In our experimental framework, we devised four distinct prompt
489

settings. For each setting, a tailored prompt template was meticulously crafted as illustrated below:
490

Template for Single-Turn Interaction: This template is designed for single-turn interactions
491

between users and LLMs, where there is no predetermined correct answer. It facilitates open-ended
492

dialogue, allowing for a wide range of user inquiries without the expectation of specific responses.
493

Referenced Template for Single-Turn Interaction: Tailored for single-turn dialogues between
494

users and LLMs, this template incorporates predefined correct answers. It is particularly suited for
495

13


---Page Break---
interactions involving factual inquiries, such as mathematics or logic problems, where accuracy and
496

reference to correct information are paramount.
497

Template for Multi-Turn Interaction: This template caters to multi-turn conversations between
498

users and LLMs, without predefined answers. It supports extended interactions, enabling users to
499

explore topics in depth through a series of interconnected questions and responses.
500

Referenced Template for Multi-Turn Interaction: Designed for multi-turn dialogues with prede-
501

fined correct answers, this template is ideal for complex inquiries requiring sequential reasoning or
502

problem-solving, such as mathematical computations or logical deductions.
503

Each template is carefully constructed to match its intended use-case, providing a structured frame-
504

work that guides the interaction between users and LLMs towards achieving desired outcomes,
505

whether for open-ended exploration or precise problem-solving.

Scoring Methodology
511

In Section 2.2.2, Equation 7 delineates the methodology for optimizing scores. Within this frame-
512

work, the function 1{Aj
i > Ak
i } is more precisely defined as f(Aj
i, Ak
i ). Additionally, the function
513

f(Aj
i, Ak
i ) is not fixed and can be implemented using various computational strategies. We introduce
514

two distinct methodologies in this context: the Elo mechanism and the Rank mechanism.
515

Within the framework of the Elo mechanism, as specified by Equation 10, the BASE value is set to
516

10, and the SCALE factor is determined to be 400. This approach facilitates a dynamic adjustment
517

of scores based on the outcomes of pairwise comparisons, allowing for a nuanced reflection of
518

performance variations among models.
519

Conversely, in the context of the Rank mechanism, as outlined by Equation 11, rank(j) signifies the
520

current ranking of model j, with the constant K assigned a value of 200. This mechanism employs
521

a model’s ranking within a predefined hierarchy as a pivotal factor in score calculation, thereby
522

providing a straightforward, yet effective, method for evaluating comparative model performance.

Overall Algorithm of Peer Review

The overall algorithm, as delineated in Algorithm 1, encapsulates the comprehensive process outlined
525

in Section 2.2. This sequence commences with "Data Collection and LLMs Pool Construction,"

progresses through "Answer-Ranking Data Construction Based on Peer Review," advances to "Con-

Complete Experimental Results
529

In Section 3.4, we both employ elimination mechanisms to cull the weakest LLMs from the ’reviewer
530

queue’ during the evaluation process. In Figures 7 and 8, we present the results for the PEN and
531

LIS metrics, where lower PEN scores indicate better performance, and higher LIS scores denote
532

superior performance. It is evident that both the ’PiCO’ and PRE approaches demonstrate enhanced
533

performance as the number of eliminated ’reviewers’ increases. In most cases, the proposed ’PiCO’
534

method outperforms PRE.
535

In Section 3.5, we validate the effectiveness of the consistency assumption and compare it with the
536

Average Performance of the Reviewer Queue, i.e., employing a single LLM as the ’reviewer’ to
537

evaluate all response pairs and then calculating the average results of all LLMs. The comprehensive
538

results compared with the Reviewer Queue are illustrated in Table3, Figure 9, 10 and 11, revealing
539

that in the full Reviewer Queue, the performance of the vast majority of LLMs is very poor, indicating
540

that the evaluations from most LLMs are noise. However, our ’PiCO’ approach nearly matches the
541

evaluative prowess of the pool’s most capable LLM, GPT-3.5. Remarkably, given its unsupervised
542

nature, the ’PiCO’ method demonstrates the capability to mitigate the influence of noise, reaching the

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
573

1. Claims
574

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
575

paper’s contributions and scope?
576

Answer: [Yes]
577

Justification: We clearly state our claims in the abstract and introduction, such as a novel
578

unsupervised LLM evaluation method and a consistency-based constrained optimization
579

approach. These are substantiated in Section 3, demonstrating the alignment between our
580

theoretical contributions and empirical results.
581

Guidelines:
582

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
583

made in the paper.
584

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
585

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
586

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
587

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
588

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
589

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
590

are not attained by the paper.
591

2. Limitations
592

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
593

Answer: [No]
594

Justification: Although this paper does not have a separate ’Limitations’ section, the con-
595

sistency assumptions on which the work is based are clearly stated in the introduction, and
596

their validity is experimentally verified in Section 3.5. Moreover, the limitations of our work
597

are discussed in the conclusion, noting that the current study is conducted solely within a
598

text-based llm evaluation environment, and exploring the potential for future expansion into
599

multimodal large model assessments.
600

Guidelines:
601

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
602

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
603

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
604

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
605

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
606

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
607

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
608

implications would be.
609

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
610

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
611

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
612

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
613

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
614

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
615

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
616

technical jargon.
617

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
618

and how they scale with dataset size.
619

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
620

address problems of privacy and fairness.
621

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
622

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
623

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
624

24


---Page Break---
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
625

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
626

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
627

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
628

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
629

a complete (and correct) proof?
630

Answer: [Yes]
631

Justification: We thoroughly detail the Consistency Assumption which underpins our the-
632

oretical results and provide a complete proof in Section 3.5. Furthermore, we ensure that
633

all necessary assumptions are explicitly stated and each theorem and proof is carefully
634

numbered and cross-referenced for clarity and accessibility.
635

Guidelines:
636

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
637

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
638

referenced.
639

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
640

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
641

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
642

proof sketch to provide intuition.
643

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
644

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
645

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
646

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
647

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
648

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
649

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
650

Answer: [Yes]
651

Justification: We provide detailed pseudocode of our new LLM evaluation algorithm in
652

Appendix D and have made all relevant data and code publicly accessible on GitHub,
653

ensuring anonymity during the review process. This comprehensive disclosure allows other
654

researchers to reproduce our experimental results, fully aligning with our paper’s claims and
655

enhancing the credibility of our findings.
656

Guidelines:
657

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
658

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
659

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
660

whether the code and data are provided or not.
661

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
662

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
663

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
664

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
665

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
666

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
667

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
668

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
669

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
670

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
671

appropriate to the research performed.
672

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
673

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
674

nature of the contribution. For example
675

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
676

to reproduce that algorithm.
677

25


---Page Break---
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
678

the architecture clearly and fully.
679

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
680

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
681

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
682

the dataset).
683

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
684

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
685

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
686

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
687

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
688

5. Open access to data and code
689

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
690

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
691

material?
692

Answer: [Yes]
693

Justification: All necessary data and code have been made publicly available on GitHub,
694

with detailed instructions for installation, environment setup, and execution commands. This
695

includes all raw, pre-processed, intermediate, and generated data needed to reproduce our
696

experimental results. The repository is anonymous during the review process to ensure
697

compliance with double-blind requirements. This thorough documentation ensures that
698

other researchers can faithfully replicate our study.
699

Guidelines:
700

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
701

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
702

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
703

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
704

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
705

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
706

benchmark).
707

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
708

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
709

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
710

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
711

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
712

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
713

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
714

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
715

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
716

versions (if applicable).
717

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
718

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
719

6. Experimental Setting/Details
720

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
721

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
722

results?
723

Answer: [Yes]
724

Justification: We have detailed the data processing and training procedures in Sections 2.2
725

and Appendices A, B, and D. For comprehensive understanding, additional information
726

such as hyperparameters, optimizer types, and detailed data splits are provided alongside
727

the code due to space constraints in the paper.
728

Guidelines:
729

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
730

26


---Page Break---
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
731

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
732

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
733

material.
734

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
735

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
736

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
737

Answer: [Yes]
738

Justification: We conducted each experiment four times using different seeds (seed =
739

1, 2, 3, 4) to ensure robustness. The results, presented as averages, are accompanied by
740

standard deviations as error bars in Tables 1 and 2. This approach captures the variability
741

due to different initializations and confirms the reproducibility of our results. The standard
742

deviations used help clarify the extent of variability in the experiments, ensuring that our
743

statistical analysis aligns with best practices for empirical research.
744

Guidelines:
745

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
746

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
747

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
748

the main claims of the paper.
749

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
750

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
751

run with given experimental conditions).
752

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
753

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
754

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
755

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
756

of the mean.
757

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
758

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
759

of Normality of errors is not verified.
760

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
761

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
762

error rates).
763

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
764

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
765

8. Experiments Compute Resources
766

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
767

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
768

the experiments?
769

Answer: [No]
770

Justification: Although we did not detail the exact compute resources for each experimental
771

setup in the paper, we used NVIDIA A6000 graphics cards for open-source models and API
772

calls for proprietary models. To facilitate reproducibility, we have provided all necessary
773

data, ensuring that the experiments can be replicated on consumer-grade computers. This
774

approach allows readers to reproduce the results without requiring high-end computational
775

resources.
776

Guidelines:
777

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
778

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
779

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
780

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
781

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
782

27


---Page Break---
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
783

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
784

didn’t make it into the paper).
785

9. Code Of Ethics
786

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
787

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
788

Answer: [Yes]
789

Justification: The research conducted in this paper complies with the NeurIPS ethics
790

guidelines in all respects.
791

Guidelines:
792

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
793

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
794

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
795

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
796

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
797

10. Broader Impacts
798

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
799

societal impacts of the work performed?
800

Answer: [Yes]
801

Justification: In the introduction, we discuss the potential positive impact of our novel
802

unsupervised LLM evaluation approach, which could significantly advance the field of LLM
803

evaluation. However, we also recognize potential negative societal impacts, such as the
804

misuse of this technology to unfairly or inaccurately assess LLM systems, which might
805

lead to biased or misleading outcomes. We suggest potential mitigation strategies, such as
806

implementing robust validation protocols and ethical guidelines to govern the application of
807

this evaluation methodology.
808

Guidelines:
809

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
810

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
811

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
812

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
813

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
814

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
815

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
816

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
817

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
818

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
819

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
820

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
821

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
822

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
823

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
824

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
825

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
826

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
827

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
828

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
829

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
830

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
831

11. Safeguards
832

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
833

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
834

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
835

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
836

Justification: This paper introduces a new approach for unsupervised LLM evaluation and
837

does not involve the release of pre-trained models, image generators, or newly collected
838

datasets. Therefore, there are no direct risks associated with misuse or dual-use of such
839

resources, making safeguards for controlled release irrelevant to this study.
840

Guidelines:
841

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
842

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
843

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
844

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
845

safety filters.
846

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
847

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
848

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
849

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
850

faith effort.
851

12. Licenses for existing assets
852

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
853

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
854

properly respected?
855

Answer: [Yes]
856

Justification: This paper utilizes the FastChat project’s code, along with several other pre-
857

trained models and datasets. The FastChat project adheres to the Apache License 2.0. In
858

compliance with the licensing requirements, we have included the original project’s licensing
859

information in all derivative works and have clearly marked any modifications made to the
860

code. Additionally, we have ensured that all utilized pre-trained models and datasets are
861

appropriately cited.
862

Guidelines:
863

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
864

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
865

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
866

URL.
867

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
868

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
869

service of that source should be provided.
870

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
871

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
872

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
873

license of a dataset.
874

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
875

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
876

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
877

the asset’s creators.
878

13. New Assets
879

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
880

provided alongside the assets?
881

Answer: [NA]
882

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
883

Guidelines:
884

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
885

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
886

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
887

limitations, etc.
888

29


---Page Break---
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
889

asset is used.
890

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
891

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
892

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
893

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
894

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
895

well as details about compensation (if any)?
896

Answer: [NA]
897

Justification: This paper focuses on an unsupervised evaluation method for LLMs that
898

does not require human feedback or interaction. Consequently, there is no involvement of
899

crowdsourcing or research with human subjects, making details about participant instructions
900

and compensation irrelevant.
901

Guidelines:
902

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
903

human subjects.
904

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
905

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
906

included in the main paper.
907

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
908

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
909

collector.
910

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
911

Subjects
912

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
913

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
914

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
915

institution) were obtained?
916

Answer: [NA]
917

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
918

Guidelines:
919

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
920

human subjects.
921

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
922

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
923

should clearly state this in the paper.
924

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
925

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
926

guidelines for their institution.
927

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
928

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
