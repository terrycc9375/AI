Abstract

Significant progress has been made in text-to-video generation through the use of
powerful generative models and large-scale internet data. However, substantial
challenges remain in precisely controlling individual concepts within the generated
video, such as the motion and appearance of specific characters and the movement
of viewpoints. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that generates each
concept in 3D representation separately and then composes them with priors from
Large Language Models (LLM) and 2D diffusion models. Specifically, given an
input textual prompt, our scheme consists of three stages: 1) We leverage LLM
as the director to first decompose the complex query into several sub-prompts
that indicate individual concepts within the video (e.g., scene, objects, motions),
then we let LLM to invoke pre-trained expert models to obtain corresponding
3D representations of concepts. 2) To compose these representations, we prompt
multi-modal LLM to produce coarse guidance on the scales and coordinates of
trajectories for the objects. 3) To make the generated frames adhere to natural image
distribution, we further leverage 2D diffusion priors and use Score Distillation
Sampling to refine the composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can generate high-fidelity videos from text with diverse motion and flexible
control over each concept. Project page: https://aka.ms/c3v.

Introduction

Benefitting from large-scale data and the advancement of the generative models [1, 2], we have
witnessed plenty of astonishing results across a wide array of tasks. For example, Large Language
Models (LLM) pre-trained on web-scale datasets are revolutionizing machine learning with strong
capability of zero-shot learning [3] and planning [4, 5], while diffusion models [6] empower text-to-
image generation with a rapid surge in both quality and diversity [7–9].

To harness the power of text-to-image models in text-to-video generation, modern solutions directly
view video as multiple images. In this way, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to extending
text-to-image models with temporal interaction to ensure consistency between frames [10–17].
However, generating visual content conditioned on the textual prompt alone struggles to express
multiple concepts with precise spatial layout control [18–20]. To tackle this issue, LVD [21] and
VideoDirectorGPT [22] propose to first generate spatiotemporal bounding boxes of each object based
on the textual prompt with LLM, and then condition the video generation on the obtained layouts.
Although rough layout control can be realized, they still have inherent limitations for detailed concept
control, e.g., the motion and appearance of specific characters, and the movement of viewpoints.

In nature, our understanding of the world is compositional [23, 24, 20], and the interaction with the
world takes place in a 3D. Motivated by this, in contrast to the prior endeavors that implicitly learn
different concepts in 2D space, we are interested in exploring an alternative solution that explicitly
composes concepts in 3D space for video generation. To this end, we in particular identify two key
technical challenges: 1) Since a textual prompt contains multiple concepts, how to coordinate the
generation of various concepts? 2) Given the generated concepts, how to compose them to follow
common sense in the real world?

In this work, we introduce text-guided compositional 3D-aware video generation (C3V), a novel
paradigm that regards LLM as director and 3D as structural representation for video generation. C3V
consists of three main stages: 1) Given a textual prompt, to coordinate the generation of various
concepts, we leverage LLM to disassemble the input prompt into sub-prompts, where each sub-
prompt describes an individual concept, e.g., the scene, objects, and motion. For each concept, a
pre-trained expert model is assigned by LLM to generate its corresponding 3D representation (e.g.,
3D Gaussians [25], SMPL parameters [26]) according to the textual description. 2) To provide coarse
instruction for composition (i.e., the scale and trajectory of each object in the scene), we further resort
to the priors in multi-modal LLM by querying it with the rendered scene image and the textual goals.
However, directly instructing multi-modal LLM to return the scale and trajectory of each object leads
to unexpected results, as it is challenging for LLM to estimate visual dynamics. Therefore, we follow
a step-by-step reasoning philosophy [27] by representing the object with the bounding boxes and
dividing the trajectory estimation into sub-tasks, i.e., estimating the starting points, ending points, and
trajectories step-by-step. 3) After obtaining the coarse trajectories from the language space, we also
propose to refine the scales, rotations, and exact locations with priors from large-scale visual data.
Specifically, taking inspiration from DreamFusion [28], which proposes to distill generative priors
from pre-trained image diffusion models into 3D objects, we employ Score Distillation Sampling
(SDS) [28] to optimize the transformation matrix of each object in 3D space.

Our system has three main advantages: 1) Because each concept is represented by individual 3D
representations, it naturally supports flexible control and interaction of each concept. 2) It inherently
excels at synthesizing complex and long videos such as drama, etc. 3) The viewpoint is controllable.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can generate 3D-aware videos with
diverse motion and high visual quality, even from complex queries that contain multiple concepts and
relationships. We also illustrate the flexibility of C3V by editing various concepts of the generated
videos. The generated videos are presented on our project page. To the best of our knowledge, we
make the first attempt towards text-guided compositional 3D-aware video generation. We hope it can
inspire further explorations on the interplay between video and 3D generation.

Video Generation with LLM

Recently, there have been substantial efforts in training text-to-video models on large-scale datasets
with autoregressive Transformer [29, 30, 17] or diffusion models [10–13, 16]. A prominent approach
for text-to-video generation is to extend a pre-trained text-to-image model by inserting temporal
layers into its architecture, and fine-tuning models on video data. However, although effective,
it remains challenging to generate objects with specific attributes or positions. To address this
challenge, a series of studies proposed to exploit knowledge from LLM [31, 32] to achieve controllable
generation [21, 19, 22, 33–35], zero-shot generation [36–39], or long video generation [40]. For
example, Free-Bloom [36] and DirecT2V [38] used LLM to transform the input textual prompt
into a sequence of sub-prompts that describe each frame. LVD [21] and VideoDirectorGPT [22]
employed LLM to generate spatiotemporal bounding boxes to control the object-level dynamics in
video generation.

In light of the above success of exploiting LLM to direct video generation in 2D space, we view LLM
as a director in 3D, which differs from previous methods not only in terms of technical route but also
in benefits: providing free interaction with individual concepts and flexible viewpoint control.

Compositional 3D Generation

Generating 3D assets from textual prompt has garnered significant attention owing to its promising
applications in various fields such as AR [41], VR [42], and autonomous driving [43]. However, due
to the lack of large-scale 3D data, it is challenging to apply 2D generative models to 3D directly.
Therefore, building upon Dream Fields [44], DreamFusion introduced the Score Distillation Sampling
(SDS) [28], a technique enhancing 3D generation by distilling 2D diffusion priors from pre-trained
text-to-image generative models. Motivated by the success of DreamFusion [28], dedicated efforts
have been made to improve SDS [45–47]. Though achieving remarkable results, these methods
struggle to generate scenes with multiple distinct elements. To mitigate this issue, several techniques
was proposed to guide 3D generation with additional conditions like layout priors, which we refer to
as compositional 3D generation [48–50]. However, these works still focus on static compositional
3D generation and lack visual dynamic modeling.

Recently, two concurrent works Comp4D [51] and TC4D [52] also achieved compositional 4D
generation (i.e., dynamic 3D generation). However, they only considered composition between
objects, and the trajectory of these methods is either formulated by kinematics-based equations or
pre-defined by users. Differently, we explore 3D-aware video generation with integrated 3D scenes
and compose various concepts with priors from both LLM and 2D diffusion models.

Preliminaries

3.1
3D Gaussian Splatting

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [25] has been attracting a lot of interest for novel view synthesis,
due to its photorealistic visual quality and real-time rendering. 3DGS utilizes a set of anisotropic
ellipsoids (i.e., 3D Gaussians) to encode 3D properties, in which each Gaussian is parameterized by
position µ ∈R3, covariance Σ ∈R3×3 (obtained from scale s ∈R3 and rotation r ∈R3), opacity
α ∈R, and color c ∈R3.

To render a novel view, 3DGS adopts a tile-based rasterization, where 3D Gaussians are projected
onto the image plane as 2D Gaussians. The final color c(p) of pixel p is denoted as:

c(p) =
X
ˆcˆσ
Y
(1 −ˆσ),
(1)

where ˆc and ˆσ represent the individual color and opacity values of a series of 2D Gaussians con-
tributing to this pixel. 3DGS are then optimized using L1 loss and SSIM [53] loss in a per-view
optimization manner. Thanks to the nature of modeling 3D scenes explicitly, optimized 3D Gaussians
can be easily controlled and edited.

3.2
Score Distillation Sampling

Different from text-to-image generation which benefits from a large number of text-image pairs
available, text-to-3D generation suffers from a severe lack of data. To mitigate this issue, Score
Distillation Sampling (SDS) [28] was proposed to distill generative priors from pretrained diffusion-
based text-to-image models ϕ. Specifically, for a 3D representation parameterized by θ, SDS is
served as a way to measure the similarity between the rendered images x = g(θ) and the given textual
prompts y, where g represents the rendering operation. As a result, the gradients used to update θ are
computed as follows:

∇θLSDS(ϕ, x = g(θ)) = Et,ϵ[w(t)(ˆϵϕ(xt; y, t) −ϵ)],
(2)

where t is the noise level, ϵ is the ground-truth noise, w(t) is a weighting function, ˆϵϕ is the estimated
noise given noised images xt with text embeddings y. Please refer to DreamFusion [28] for details.

decomposed into individual concepts by the LLM. Then we generate each concept in the form of
3D with the corresponding pre-trained expert model (left & Sec. 4.1). 2) We leverage knowledge
in multi-modal LLM to estimate the 2D trajectory of objects step-by-step (middle & Sec. 4.2). 3)
After lifting the estimated 2D trajectory into 3D as initialization, we refine the scales, locations, and
rotations of objects within the 3D scene using 2D diffusion priors (right & Sec. 4.3).

of which provides a description for generating a corresponding concept (i.e., scene, object, motion,
etc.) respectively (Sec. 4.1). Subsequently, we leverage multi-modal LLM to obtain coarse-grained
scales and trajectories for each animatable object (Sec. 4.2). Finally, we employ 2D diffusion priors
to refine the objects’ location, scale, and rotation for a fine-grained composition (Sec. 4.3).

4.1
Task Decomposition with LLM

Task Instructions.
Given a textual prompt, we invoke LLM (e.g., GPT-4V [32]) to decompose it
into several sub-prompts. Each sub-prompt describes an individual concept such as the scene, object,
and motion. Specifically, for an input prompt y, we query LLM with the instruction like: "Please
decompose this prompt into several sub-prompts, each describing the scene, objects in the scene, and
the objects’ motion.", from which we obtain the corresponding sub-prompts.

3D Representation.
After obtaining the sub-prompt for each concept, we aim to generate its
corresponding 3D representations using the pre-trained expert models. In this work, we build
structural representation on 3DGS [25], which is an explicit form and therefore flexible enough to
compose or animate. Concerning concepts like motion, our framework can generalize to arbitrary
animatable 3D Gaussian-based objects. For simplicity, we take human motion as an instantiation
because it is general for various scenarios. In order to obtain diverse human motions, we take a
retrieval-augmented approach [54] to acquire motion in the form of SMPL-X parameters [55] from
large motion libraries [56] according to the motion-related sub-prompt.

Instantiation.
To illustrate the scheme formally, consider the following example. We have sub-
prompts y1, y2 and y3 that describe scene, object, and motion respectively. Additionally, we have
corresponding pre-trained text-guided expert models ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3 that are selected by the LLM.
The concept generation can be formulated as follows:

G1 = ϕ1(y1), G2 = ϕ2(y2, M), M = ϕ3(y3),
(3)

modal LLM to estimate dynamic trajectory directly, we generate trajectory in a step-by-step manner:
estimating the locations of starting and ending points first, then reasoning the path between them.

where G1 and G2 represent the 3D Gaussians, and M means the motions used to drive G2. In the
following sections, we will provide details on the composition of the generated concepts.

4.2
Coarse-grained Trajectory Generation with LLM

Given the generated concepts, we aim to compose them into a dynamic 3D representation to render
videos that align with the input textual prompt. Achieving this requires scales and trajectories of the
objects to indicate their sizes and locations within the scene. To this end, we propose to leverage
knowledge encoded in multi-modal LLMs (i.e., GPT-4V [32]) to provide priors.

For the scale of the object, we find that directly querying GPT-4V with the input prompt and rendered
scene image can yield a reasonable estimation of its resolution (H2D and W2D). However, this is not
the case for trajectory estimation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, directly querying GPT-4V for trajectory
will lead to a result that deviates conspicuously from common sense. Based on this observation, we
conclude two issues: 1) it is too difficult for GPT-4V to generate the trajectory within a single query,
as it lacks priors on visual dynamics; 2) since GPT-4V is trained to generate text, it has limitations on
imagining visual content.

To mitigate this, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques. 1) Although GPT-4V lacks visual
knowledge of the object, we can alleviate this by representing the object as a bounding box with
the estimated resolution. 2) We follow a step-by-step reasoning philosophy [27] and propose to let
GPT-4V estimate the locations of starting and ending points first, then reason the path between them.

Overall, we can formulate the above process as follows:

{Li
p}N
i=1 = Φ(yp, I, S, Ls, Le),

S =Φ(y, I), Ls = Φ(ys, I), Le = Φ(ye, I),
(4)

where Φ represents the multi-modal LLM (i.e., GPT-4V), I denotes the rendered scene image, S
represents the estimated scale of the object given textual prompt y and I, Ls and Le represent the
locations of starting and ending points respectively, {Li
p}N
i=1 represent N locations indicating the
path between Ls and Le. Notably, all locations (i.e., Ls, Le,{Li
p}N
i=1 ) are represented by 2D pixel
coordinates on I.

4.3
Fine-grained Composition with 2D Diffusion Priors

Lift Trajectory from 2D to 3D.
In Sec. 4.2, we obtain the 2D pixel coordinates Li
p = (pi
x, pi
y)
of the estimated trajectory. However, 2D trajectory is not enough for composition in 3D space.
Therefore, we convert it into corresponding 3D world coordinate Li
3D = (xi, yi, zi). Specifically, we
first predict the depth map D of the rendered scene image with a monocular depth estimator [57].

5


---Page Break---
Then, we use the depth value of the center point of the lower boundary of the bounding box as the
trajectory’s depth. As a result, we can transform 2D trajectory into 3D:

(xi, yi, zi, 1)T = R−1K−1[(pi
x + H2D

2
, pi
y, 1)T · D(pi
x + H2D

2
, pi
y)] −(H3D

2
, 0, 0, 0)T ,
(5)

where R and K represent camera extrinsic and intrinsic respectively, H2D and W2D represent the
resolution of the 2D bounding box. H3D represent the actual height of the 3D bounding box of this
object within the scene.

Composition Refinement with 2D Diffusion Priors.
With the lifted 3D trajectory, we then
integrate the object into the scene. However, the trajectory estimated by LLM is still rough and may
not obey natural image distribution. To address this, we propose to further refine the object’s scale,
location, and rotation by distilling generative priors from pre-trained image diffusion models [7]
into 3D space. Specifically, we treat the parameters for these attributes as optimizable variables and
use SDS (Eq. 2) to improve the fidelity of rendered images. As a result, scale refinement can be
formulated as follows:

∇ˆSLScale
SDS = Et,ϵ[w(t)(ˆϵϕ(xt(L1
3D, (S + σ( ˆS) · τs −τs

2 ) · G2); y, t) −ϵ)],
(6)

where ˆS represents the optimizable variable, S represents the scale estimated by GPT-4(V), σ means
the Sigmoid function, τs is a threshold, G2 represents the 3D gaussians of the object, and xt is the
noised 2D image given Li
3D and scaled G2.

After obtaining a more precise scale, we then refine the locations of the estimated 3D trajectory
similarly, where the location refinement is denoted as:

∇ˆ
LiLLocation
SDS
= Et,ϵ[w(t)(ˆϵϕ(xt(Li
3D +σ( ˆLi)·τL−τL

2 , (S +σ( ˆS)·τs−τs

2 )·G2); y, t)−ϵ)], (7)

where ˆLi represents the optimizable variable, τL is a threshold.

For the rotation of the object at different timesteps, we can directly compute the corresponding
rotation matrix, based on the assumption that the object at the current time step should face the
location of the object at the next time step. As a result, the rotation matrix ˆ
Ri at time step i can be
computed using the following equation:

ˆ
Ri =




tx2 + c
txy −zs
txz + ys
txy + zs
ty2 + c
tyz −xs
txz −ys
tyz + xs
tz2 + c



,

t = 1 −c, c = cos(θ), s = sin(θ), u = (x, y, z)T

(8)

where θ and u represent the rotation angle and axis obtained through the cross product of (Li+1
3D +
σ( ˆ
Li+1) · τL −Li
3D −σ( ˆLi) · τL) and (0, 0, 1)T .

Inference.
After obtaining individual concepts in the form of 3D and the optimized parameters that
indicate how to compose various concepts, we can render the 3D representation into 2D video with
flexible camera control in real time [25].

Experiments

In this section, we instantiate C3V with three concepts: scene, humanoid object, and human motion,
to generate 3D-aware video from text. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art text-to-
4D models (4D-FY [58]), compositional 4D generation models (Comp4D [51]) and text-to-video
models (VideoCrafter2 [59]). Videos are available on our anonymous project page.

Implementation Details.
We use LucidDreamer [60], HumanGaussian [61] and Motion-X [56] to
generate 3D scenes, humanoid objects and motions respectively. To realize SDS, we utilize Stable
Diffusion [7] as the image diffusion model. All the videos of our proposed method are rendered at a
resolution of 512 × 512 in real time. Please refer to the appendix for more details.

and high visual quality. For example, our scheme successfully obeys the complex query in terms of

Ablation Studies

Ablations on Trajectory Estimation with Multi-modal LLM.
As shown in Fig. 4(a)(I), a direct
prompt of GPT-4V will lead to obvious unsatisfactory trajectory estimation. When only depending
on bounding boxes to indicate the location of objects within the scene (Fig. 4(a)(II)), though a
roughly better trajectory can be achieved, it still leads to unreasonable results, such as several floating
bounding boxes. Similarly, using only the step-by-step estimation strategy described in Sec. 4.2
typically results in a trajectory that is merely a simple straight line connecting the starting and ending
points (Fig. 4(a)(III)). With both of the two techniques, we can achieve the best performance, with a
more reasonable and smooth trajectory (Fig. 4(a)(IV)).

Ablations on Composition with 2D Diffusion Models.
To figure out whether it is necessary to
conduct fine-grained composition with 2D generative priors, we gradually refine the scales, locations,
and rotations with SDS and visualize the results in Fig. 4(b). All results are generated with the same
textual prompt: "An alien walking on the floor in front of the cabin’s door.". It shows that when we
optimize the attributes with SDS, we can obtain consistently improved performance with a reasonable
scale (Fig. 4(b)(II), accurate locations that are aligned with the input prompt (Fig. 4(b)(III), and
orientation that accords with common sense (Fig. 4(b)(IV)).

Applications on Controllable Generation

Due to our underlying 3D structural representation, our scheme has the natural merits of editing
individual concepts. We illustrate this character in Fig. 5 by editing three different concepts: the
appearance and motion of the actors, and the scenes. For the appearance and motion of the actor,
we can seamlessly replace them in a zero-shot manner according to the textual prompt (Fig.5(a)(b)),
while this is still challenging for implicit models [64, 65]. For scene editing, to ensure a smooth
composition of objects within the target scene, we re-estimate the trajectory of the objects given the
target scene. Kindly refer to appendix for more results.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel paradigm for 3D-aware video generation by conceptualizing videos
as compositions of independent concepts represented in 3D space. To this end, we leverage LLM as
director to decompose the input textual prompts into individual concepts and then invoke pre-trained
expert models to generate them separately. To compose various concepts, we first prompt multi-modal
LLM in a step-by-step manner to provide coarse guidance on the scale and trajectory of objects,

then refine the composition with 2D generative priors. We verify our scheme in different scenarios,
demonstrating its superiority over the baseline methods.

Limitations and Future Works.
Although we demonstrate promising results in 3D-aware video
generation, there still are limitations to be improved in the future. First, our framework is instantiated
with limited concepts in this work, i.e., scene, humanoid object, and human motion. It is exciting
to generalize the framework to more concepts like animals, vehicles, etc. Second, the composition
between concepts is conducted with priors from LLM and 2D diffusion priors in our method. However,
it is still interesting to introduce physically grounded dynamics into 3D representation [66]. Third,
though our method is naturally suitable for maintaining the consistency of actors across different
scenes, it still needs further exploration on long video generation with multiple scenes, e.g., a
full-length film.

Ethics Statement.
C3V is exclusively a research initiative with no current plans for product
integration or public access. We are committed to adhering to Microsoft AI principles during the
ongoing development of our models. The model is trained on AI-generated content, which has
been thoroughly reviewed to ensure that they do not include personally identifiable information or
offensive content. Nonetheless, as these generated data are sourced from the Internet, there may still
be inherent biases. To address this, we have implemented a rigorous filtering process on the data to
minimize the potential for the model to generate inappropriate content.

Implementation Details

A.1
Experimental Settings

During the process of multi-modal LLMs-based trajectory estimation, we use 20 locations by default
to indicate the trajectory between the starting point and the ending point, (i.e., N = 20 in Eq. 4),
where the path between adjacent locations is assumed as a straight line. For scale refinement (Eq. 6),
τs is set to 0.1. For location refinement (Eq. 7), we apply it to refine all the twenty locations. The
training iterations for each location is 1000 and τL is set to 0.1. All experiments are conducted using
a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

A.2
Pre-trained Expert Models

LucidDreamer [60].
As a powerful 3D scene generation method, LucidDreamer adopts an iterative
view generation strategy, where a series of views are dreamed and aligned via depth-warping based
inpainting networks. After obtaining these multiview-consistent images, 3D gaussians are optimized
to construct a high-quality 3D scene, by means of typical training pipeline of 3DGS.

HumanGaussian [61].
We choose HumanGaussian as the method for human generation due to
its capability of producing drivable avatars on the basis of 3DGS. Specifically, HumanGaussian
starts with SMPL-X prior to densely sample Gaussians on the human mesh surface as initial center
positions, followed by a texture-structure joint model and an annealed negative prompt guidance
strategy to obtain high-fidelity outputs.

Motion-X [56].
Motion-X is a large-scale 3D expressive whole-body human motion dataset which
comprises 15.6M precise 3D whole-body pose annotations (i.e., SMPL-X) covering 81.1K motion
sequences from massive scenes with sequence-level semantic labels. By calculating the similarity
of text embeddings between the motion-related sub-prompt and sequence labels, we find the most
matching sequence and acquire motion data in the form of SMPL-X parameters [55].

A.3
Metrics

Given the lack of ground truth videos for specific text queries, we utilize pre-trained quality-
assessment models to evaluate the generated videos and their individual frames. In line with
Comp4D [51], we employ Q-Align [62] as the benchmarking tool to assess the quality and aes-
thetics of the videos. The Q-Align rating, which ranges from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), is considered
state-of-the-art, closely aligning with human judgments across established quality assessment bench-
marks. Additionally, we include the CLIP score [63] to measure the alignment between the generated
videos and the input texts, where higher scores signify better alignment.

B
Results of Different Stages

As shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we provide a detailed visualization of results obtained during
different stages, including results of LLM-based task decomposition, results of coarse-grained
trajectory generation with GPT-4V, and results of the final rendered videos.

C
More Results of Controllable Generation

In this section, we present additional results on controllable generation. As demonstrated in Fig. 9,
Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, we can achieve fine-grained control of the target without affecting other concepts
in the 3D space.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clarify our contributions in Sec. 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clarify our limitations in Sec. 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

21


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide implementation details in Sec. 5 and Sec. A.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

22


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]

Justification: We do not provide open access to the data and code in supplemental material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide implementation details in Sec. 5 and Sec. A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported because they would be too computationally expen-
sive.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

23


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide computer resources used in Sec. A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report possible impacts of our method in Sec. 1 and Sec. 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite all models and datasets mentioned in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

25


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper proposes a novel paradigm for text-to-video generation, named C3V.
We plan to release the model’s code along with comprehensive documentation to facilitate
its use and replication.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The human avatars showed in this paper are all virtual humans that have no
relationships with real human beings.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The human avatars showed in this paper are all virtual humans that have no
relationships with real human beings.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
