Abstract

Quantization of diffusion models has attracted considerable attention due to its
potential to enable various applications on resource-constrained mobile devices.
However, given the cumulative nature of quantization errors in quantized diffusion
models, overall performance may still decline even with efforts to minimize quanti-
zation error at each sampling step. Recent studies have proposed several methods
to address accumulated quantization error, yet these solutions often suffer from
limited applicability due to their underlying assumptions or only partially resolve
the issue due to an incomplete understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel
perspective by conceptualizing quantization error as a "stepback" in the denoising
process. We investigate how the accumulation of quantization error can distort
the sampling trajectory, resulting in a notable decrease in model performance. To
address this challenge, we introduce StepbaQ, a method that calibrates the sampling
trajectory and counteracts the adverse effects of accumulated quantization error
through a sampling step correction mechanism. Notably, StepbaQ relies solely on
statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset, highlighting
its strong applicability. Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can
serve as a plug-and-play technique to enhance the performance of diffusion models
quantized by off-the-shelf tools without modifying the quantization settings. For
example, StepbaQ signiﬁcantly improves the performance of the quantized SD v1.5
model by 7.30 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the common W8A8
setting, and it enhances the performance of the quantized SDXL-Turbo model by
17.31 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the challenging W4A8 setting.

Introduction

Diffusion models [11, 44, 23, 49] have demonstrated its power of generating high quality samples in
a wide variety of applications including super resolution [53, 58], image enhancement [37, 54], image
inpainting [56], image editing [28] and image-to-image translation [32]. In contrast to GAN [18]
and VAE [30], which are prone to issues such as mode and posterior collapse, diffusion models
consistently produce diverse, high-quality samples, thus emerging as the predominant technique in
the ﬁeld of image generation. However, the deployment of diffusion models on computationally
constrained devices, such as smartphones, is impeded by their extensive computational demands,
which stem from the complex network structures and the multitude of denoising steps required during
the sampling phase. To enhance the computational efﬁciency of diffusion models, a body of research

has concentrated on reducing the number of sampling steps [49, 39, 41, 46]. Concurrently, another
strand of investigation has pursued model compression strategies, such as quantization [47, 33, 48,
19, 57, 24, 20, 52] and pruning [14], to diminish the computational resources necessitated. In this
paper, we focus on improving the performance of model quantization.

Model quantization [31, 16] stands as one of the most popular model compression techniques. This
technique transits model parameters and activations from a high bit-width ﬂoating-point format
to a more compact low bit-width representation, thereby facilitating a substantial acceleration of
model inference with a tolerable drop in performance. However, quantizing diffusion models leads to
greater performance degradation compared to standard deep learning models due to two challenges:
i) Activation range varies across timesteps. Diffusion models generate samples from a normal
distribution through a multi-step denoising process, wherein noise levels are gradually reduced
following a predeﬁned schedule. This mechanism results in a signiﬁcant disparity in the activation
range across different timesteps, as noted in studies by Shang et al. [47] and Li et al. [33]. Such
variability poses a challenge in establishing an appropriate quantization range. Opting for a broader
interval may mitigate clipping errors at the expense of increased rounding errors and vice versa.
Prior research by Shang et al. [47] and Li et al. [33] have proposed sampling strategies to select
representative calibration samples over multiple timesteps. To further reduce quantization errors, So
et al. [48], He et al. [19], and Yang et al. [57] relax the quantization constraints, adopting techniques
such as timestep-speciﬁc quantization parameters and mixed precision quantization. However, since
these methods do not consider the accumulation of quantization errors, they only achieve mediocre
performance. ii) Quantization error accumulates over time. The iterative nature of the denoising
process in diffusion models means that quantization errors from each step can accumulate. Although
errors at individual sampling steps may appear negligible, the cumulative effect can signiﬁcantly
impair the ﬁnal sample quality. To mitigate this error propagation, Huang et al. [24] have underscored
the signiﬁcance of temporal features and introduced a temporal information-aware reconstruction
method to prevent deviations from the intended sampling trajectory caused by temporal information
mismatch. Conversely, He et al. [20] have presented PTQD, which employs variance schedule
calibration to integrate the quantization error at each step into the Gaussian diffusion noise of
stochastic samplers, thereby addressing the accumulation issue. However, the approach proposed
by Huang et al. [24] only resolves the disturbance of temporal features without considering the
distribution shift in the latent space. On the other hand, the strategy of error absorption introduced
by He et al. [20] is limited to stochastic samplers, thereby excluding its application to deterministic
samplers, such as DDIM [49].

In this work, our goal is to devise a general approach capable of addressing the issue of error
accumulation and enhancing the performance of the quantized diffusion model. We investigate the
mechanisms by which accumulated errors can detrimentally impact overall model performance. Our
research reveals that quantization error can alter the distribution of the latent variables. This shift in
the distribution can lead to a divergence from the original sampling trajectory, ultimately causing a
decline in model performance. Intriguingly, we show that with the assumption of quantization error
following Gaussian distribution, the distribution shift in the latent space caused by quantization error
can be interpreted as a "stepback" in the denoising process.

Building upon this insight, we introduce StepbaQ, a novel method that uses a sampling step correction
technique to minimize the deviation from the original sampling trajectory. StepbaQ analyzes quanti-
zation errors to measure the extent of the distribution shifts and subsequently determine the "corrected
sampling steps." We demonstrate that with appropriate modiﬁcations based on the corrected sampling
steps, StepbaQ can effectively correct the sampling trajectory and mitigate the accumulation of quan-
tization error, thereby signiﬁcantly enhancing the quality of the generated results. It is worth noting
that StepbaQ only necessitates the statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration
dataset. Consequently, it can be seamlessly integrated with existing quantization frameworks as a
plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf
tools without modifying their quantization settings.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

• We introduce a novel perspective that interprets the distribution shift in the latent space, caused by
quantization error, as a "stepback" in the denoising process. We demonstrate that such a temporal
shift can alter the sampling trajectory and adversely affect the generated results.

• We propose StepbaQ, a general strategy designed to enhance the performance of quantized diffusion
models. This method employs a sampling step correction technique to realign the sampling
trajectory and eliminate the accumulation of quantization error.

• Extensive experiments show that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique, signiﬁcantly
improving the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf tools, and achieve the
state-of-the-art performance for quantized diffusion models.

Efﬁcient Diffusion Models

Although diffusion models have powerful generative capabilities, slow inference speeds severely
limit their practical application. Various approaches have been developed to improve the efﬁciency of
diffusion models. Rombach et al. [45] speeds up each denoising step by transferring the denoising
process to the latent space; Song et al. [49] modiﬁes the original diffusion process with a non-
Markovian formulation, enabling fewer sampling steps and deterministic sampling. Lu et al. [39]
further reduce the required number of steps by introducing an exact solution formulation for diffusion
ODEs. Luo et al. [41] applies a consistency model to the latent space, enabling fast sampling with
just a few steps or potentially a single step. Sauer et al. [46] leverages adversarial training on the
diffusion model, enabling the network to generate images in one step, just like GAN [18]. While
the methods above can effectively speed up the inference process of diffusion models, deploying
these models on devices with limited computational resources necessitates reduced computation and
memory usage, which can be achieved via model quantization.

2.2
Diffusion Model Quantization

Model quantization is a technique that effectively reduces memory and computation costs required
for deep learning models. It can be divided into two categories: Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) [13, 17, 27, 26], which mitigates performance drop after quantization through model ﬁne-
tuning at the expense of substantial computational cost, and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) [42,
34, 25, 55, 15, 43, 10], which requires only a small calibration dataset and therefore is ideal for
large models like diffusion models. While prior works have achieved considerable progress, directly
applying conventional quantization methods on diffusion models does not yield good results due to
challenges such as varying activation range across steps and error accumulation. Shang et al. [47] and
Li et al. [33] propose sampling strategies for selecting representative calibration samples across steps
to alleviate the issue of varying activation ranges. Some methods relax the quantization constraints
and use ﬁner granularity to enhance quantization results. For example, Yang et al. [57] leverage
SQNR as a metric to ﬁnd sensitive blocks and quantize them with higher precision. Li et al. [35], So
et al. [48], and He et al. [19] employ distinct sets of quantization parameters at various timesteps to
address the drastic changes in activation ranges. While effective, these strategies incur additional
computational overhead, which reduces their practicality. Moreover, even when efforts are made
to minimize quantization error at each sampling step, the overall performance still suffers due to
error accumulation. To address the issue of error accumulation, Huang et al. [24] propose temporal
information aware reconstruction, which alleviates temporal feature disturbance, to prevent deviation
from the original sampling trajectory. On the other hand, Tang et al. [50] introduces a progressive
calibration strategy to minimize accumulation error. Aside from the approaches above, the method
PTQD, proposed by He et al. [20], is closely related to our work. Both methods utilize the statistics of
quantization error to enhance the performance of quantized diffusion models. They can be considered
complementary techniques integrated with existing quantization approaches. PTQD decomposes
the quantization error into correlated and uncorrelated parts. The correlated part is eliminated by
simple division, while the uncorrelated part is absorbed into the scheduled Gaussian noise. Though
this strategy is effective, its practicality is restricted. The design of the error absorption mechanism is
only compatible with stochastic samplers, such as DDPM [23], which narrows its applicability. In
contrast, our proposed StepbaQ, utilizing a sampling step correction technique, is applicable to both
deterministic and stochastic samplers.

hand, illustrates how StepbaQ treats the quantization error as a stepback in the denoising process and
adopts corrected steps with a larger step size to eliminate cumulative quantization error.

Preliminary

Diffusion models [23, 49] are latent variable models characterized by a forward process, wherein
Gaussian noise of a predetermined magnitude is incrementally applied to the original data x0. The
goal is to learn a reverse process that gradually removes noise from latent to generate high-quality
images. The equations of the posterior and Gaussian transitions are deﬁned as follows:

q(x1:M|x0) :=

M
Y

t=1
q(xt|xt−1),
q(xt|xt−1) := N(
r αt

αt−1
xt−1, (1 −
αt
αt−1
)I)
(1)

Here, [α0, . . . , αM] represents a descending sequence of hyperparameters that schedule the noise
level, as described in [49]. Through the reparameterization technique [40], we can express xt as:

xt = √αtx0 +
√

1 −αtϵ,
ϵ ∼N(0, I)
(2)

The aim of a diffusion model is to learn a parameterized distribution pθ(x0) that approximates
q(x0) =
R
pθ(x0:M)dx1:M and is easy to sample from. The parameters θ are trained by optimizing a
variational lower bound to accurately predict the added noise, as outlined in the following objective:

∥ϵ −ϵθ(√αtx0 +
√

1 −αtϵ, t)∥2
(3)

While the forward process has M steps, the denoising process can employ a condensed sampling path
by choosing a sub-sequence of length N from the set [1, . . . , M] to expedite the sampling process.
DDIM [49] presents a generalized formula to generate a sample xt−1 from a sample xt via:

xt−1 = √αt−1(xt −√1 −αtϵθ(xt, t)
√αt
) +
q

1 −αt−1 −σ2
t ϵθ(xt, t) + σtϵt,
ϵt ∼N(0, I) (4)

Varying the choices of parameter σt yields different denoising processes. Speciﬁcally, setting

σt =
q

1−αt−1

1−αt

q

1−αt

αt−1 results in DDPM [23], whereas a σt of 0 corresponds to DDIM [49].

In previous literature, the notation t ∈[1, ..., N] has been conventionally used to index the sampling
steps in the denoising process. To distinguish between the original sampling steps and the one that
StepbaQ has modiﬁed, we employ the notation [t1, ..., tN] to represent the original sampling steps,
while [τ1, ..., τN] is used to denote the steps post-correction.

Method

In this section, we ﬁrst present a novel perspective that interprets the distribution shift in the latent
space, resulting from quantization errors, as a "stepback" along the sampling trajectory. We then
explain how such temporal information affects the sampling trajectory. Finally, we introduce StepbaQ,

4


---Page Break---
a method that calibrates the sampling trajectory and counteracts the negative effects of accumulated
quantization error through a sampling step correction mechanism. We demonstrate that StepbaQ can
effectively mitigate the accumulation of quantization errors, thereby diminishing the total error. Note
that while the derivations discussed herein are based on the denoising process of DDIM [49] as in
Eq.4, the proposed StepbaQ is adaptable to other samplers with appropriate modiﬁcations.

4.1
Quantization Error as Stepback

Following PTQD [20], we assume the quantization error follows Gaussian distribution. Then the
conditional probability of the quantized latent variable ˆxti can be formulated as follows:

p(ˆxti|xti) = N(xti, σ2
i ),
ˆxti = xti + ∆i,
∆i ∼N(µi, σ2
i )
(5)

where ∆i denotes the quantization error with µi and σ2
i representing its mean and variance. As the
error mean can be readily rectiﬁed by subtracting the error mean as described in [20], here we assume
µi = 0. Recalling the Gaussian transition from step ti to step τi with τi ≥ti as mentioned in Eq. 1:

q(xτi|xti) = N(
rατi

αti
xti, (1 −ατi

αti
)I)
(6)

Scaling the latent variable xτi by
q αti

ατi , we obtain:

q(
r αti

ατi
xτi|xti) = N(xti, ( αti

ατi
−1)I)
(7)

It is observed that the scaled latent variable
q αti

ατi xτi shares the same mean as the quantized latent

variable ˆxti as shown in Eq. 5. By selecting a step τi such that
αti
ατi −1 = σ2
i , or equally ατi =
αti
1+σ2
i ,
we align the variance of the scaled latent variable with the variance of ˆxti. This alignment allows
us to state that the scaled latent variable is statistically equivalent to the quantized latent variable.
Consequently, we can consider ˆxti as being sampled from the distribution at τi-th step and scaled by
a factor
q αti

ατi . In practice, given that discrete samplers operate with a ﬁnite set of sequence α, τi can
be approximated by solving the following equation (See Appendix B for further discussion):

τi = arg min
j ∥αj −
αti
1 + σ2
i
∥,
j ∈[1, . . . , M]
(8)

Note that τi ≥ti due to the descending property of α. This novel perspective to treating the quantized
latent as if sampled from the distribution at τi-th step implies that a temporal shift, or "stepback,"
occurs in the latent space. This insight enables us to further explore the impact of quantization errors.

4.2
Error Arising from Temporal Shift

Based on the ﬁnding that a temporal shift occurs in the latent space, we will now demonstrate how
such a shift can contribute to error accumulation, resulting in a decline in overall performance.

Inaccurate Noise Prediction. Throughout the sampling process, the noise prediction network relies
on the temporal feature at the ti-th step as a conditional input, which informs the network about the
noise level of the latent variable. Given that the noise level of the quantized latent ˆxti is increased
by quantization error, utilizing the temporal feature at step ti as a condition could misguide the
noise prediction network regarding the actual noise level. This discrepancy has the potential to yield
inaccurate noise predictions. An additional concern arises from the distribution shift in the latent
space. The noise prediction network is trained with the scheduled latent distributions, as described
in Eq. 2. However, quantization error changes the latent variable’s mean and variance. Without
appropriate adjustment, the distribution of the latent variable ˆxti deviates from the expected value
range. This deviation in the input distribution can also lead to inaccurate noise predictions, ultimately
reducing overall performance.

Trajectory Deviation. For DDIM, the ﬁrst term within Eq. 4 indicates the predicted x0. The
expression xti −√1 −αtiϵθ(xti, ti) can be interpreted as advancing from the latent variable xti
toward the predicted latent variable x0 along the direction −ϵθ(xti, ti), with a step size of √1 −αti.

As the quantized latent variable ˆxti possesses a higher noise level than xti, implying that the gap
between x0 and ˆxti is more pronounced, a larger step is required to obtain the expected result.
However, previous studies ignore this discrepancy and continue utilizing αti during the denoising
process. Fig. 1(b) illustrates that adhering to the original step size, without accounting for the
quantization error, can lead to a signiﬁcant accumulation of overall error.

4.3
StepbaQ

To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we introduce StepbaQ. By employing the corrected step as
obtained by Eq. 8, we demonstrate that StepbaQ can signiﬁcantly reduce the overall accumulated
quantization error through a sequence of simple yet effective modiﬁcations.

Temporal Information Alignment. The quantized latent variable ˆxti is characterized by an in-
creased noise level in comparison to its original counterpart xti. Therefore, the temporal information
input must precisely reﬂect the increased noise levels to aid the noise prediction network make
accurate predictions. Replacing the original input ti with the corrected sampling step τi gives the
network a more accurate noise level indication.

Latent Adjustment. To approximate the quantized latent ˆxti as though it were sampled from the
distribution at the τi-th step, adjustments are necessary to align their distributions. We subtract
the channel-wise mean of quantization error from the quantized latent variable, as suggested in
PTQD [20], and rescale it by a factor
q ατi

αti . These adjustments effectively bridge the distribution
shift and improve the noise prediction results.

Step Size Adaptation. Nevertheless, improving the noise prediction results is not enough. As
depicted in Fig.2, the quantization errors increase the variance of quantized latent variables and
decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), deﬁned as SNR = µ2

σ2 [40], which enlarges the distance
between ˆxti and x0. Therefore, the step size should be extended to consider the increased distance.
This extension can be realized by substituting the original step size √1 −αti with √1 −ατi, which
is the requisite step size for progressing towards x0 from the latent variable of τi-th step. The adjusted
step size is longer than or equal to the original one, owing to the relationship ατi ≤αti. Fig. 1(c)
illustrates that the cumulative error can be markedly diminished by adapting the step size.

Accounting for Error Accumulation. Since discrete samplers only involve ﬁnite sampling steps,
the modiﬁcations mentioned above only take effect when quantization errors are substantial enough
to result in a corrected step τi larger than ti. No correction will be made if the quantization error does
not meet this threshold. Nonetheless, even minor quantization errors can accumulate over multiple
steps, imperceptibly altering the latent distribution and degrading the quality of the generated output.

---Page Break---
To address this issue, instead of measuring quantization errors at each step independently, StepbaQ
measures quantization errors across multiple steps to obtain more accurate statistics for correction.

Algo. 1 shows the overall correction process of StepbaQ. Given ﬂoating-point and quantized noise
prediction networks ϵθ and ˆϵθ, StepbaQ calculates the corrected step based on statistics of quantization
error. If the error is not substantial enough, no correction is made, allowing the error to accumulate
until it becomes sufﬁciently large for correction. For simplicity, we ignore the iterations over the
whole calibration set during the measurement of quantization error. The process yields a sequence
of corrected steps [τ1, . . . , τN] and a corresponding sequence of error means [µ1, . . . , µN−1], which
are subsequently applied during the inference phase. The inference phase is identical to Algo. 1
except that lines 5-8 are skipped. As StepbaQ precludes the accumulation of error, the ﬁnal output is
inﬂuenced only by the quantization error present in the last sampling step. This error is signiﬁcantly
less than the original accumulated error without corrections.

Experiment

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed StepbaQ in enhancing the performance of quantized
diffusion models for text-guided image generation. Experiments utilizing an off-the-shelf quantization
tool show that StepbaQ can improve the performance of an existing quantized diffusion model without
altering its quantization conﬁguration. We also provide comparative results to emphasize StepbaQ’s
superiority over existing approaches. For qualitative results, please refer to Appendix D.

Figure 2: SNR curve of diffusion pro-
cess. The quantization error decreases
the SNR, which could be regarded as
a stepback. To address this issue, Step-
baQ takes a larger step to reach the
scheduled SNR.

Figure 3: Magnitude of stepback for SD v1.5 on the SD-
prompts dataset under W8A8 setting. Most sampling step
corrections occur at the last few steps of sampling, showing
the importance of these steps. Since StepbaQ considers the
error accumulation, it performs corrections more frequently
than StepbaQ w/o ACC.

Datasets and Evaluation Metrics. Our experiments are conducted on two datasets: MS-COCO [36]
and Stable-Diffusion-Prompts [7] (SDprompts), each with 5,000 samples for evaluation. We employ
the Frechet Inception Distance [22] (FID) as our evaluation metric to assess the quality of images
generated by the quantized diffusion models. Notably, as our objective is to minimize the performance
discrepancy between the ﬂoating-point model and the quantized model, we follow the setting in [50]
and utilize the images produced by the ﬂoating-point model as the reference for FID evaluation. This
approach offers a more precise indication of the performance gap resulting from quantization. In
addition, to evaluate the alignment between text and generated images, we also present the CLIP
score [21], employing ViT-L/14 [12] as the backbone.

Implementation Details. In implementing StepbaQ, we utilize a compact dataset of 128 samples
for correction. Empirical observations indicate that this sample size is adequate for gathering the
necessary statistics of quantization error, while expanding the sample size to 1024 does not yield a
discernible enhancement in performance. The correction can be fast since only a small calibration
dataset is required. For example, The correction process for the 20-step Stable-Diffusion v1.5 [9]
model can be completed in approximately 20 minutes on a single A6000 GPU.

Improvement upon Off-the-Shelf Tool

To facilitate efﬁcient on-device inference of deep learning models, the industry has proposed toolkits
such as NeuroPilot [3], OpenVINO [2], SNPE [6], and TensorRT [4]. These tools are tailored to
different platforms and support various quantization settings and algorithms. In this section, we
utilize the post-training quantization tool in NeuroPilot and demonstrate that StepbaQ signiﬁcantly
improves the performance of the given quantized diffusion model without modifying the original
quantization settings. This underscores StepbaQ’s effectiveness in seamlessly enhancing model
performance within current quantization frameworks. Considering that PTQD depends solely on the
statistics of quantization error, similar to our approach, we also include a comparison with PTQD.

Quantization Settings. Following previous works, we focus on quantizing the noise prediction
network since it is the primary computation workload. Other parts of the diffusion pipelines remain
at a ﬂoating-point precision. Notation WxAy indicates the weights are quantized to x-bit while the
activations are quantized to y-bit. We test two bit-width settings, W8A8 and W4A8, using the default
symmetric/asymmetric settings for weights and activations, respectively. The calibration set comprises
270 samples, which are uniformly selected from each step. NeuroPilot facilitates quantization of
most operators within the noise prediction network, e.g., convolution, linear layer, batch matrix
multiplication, addition, multiplication, softmax, and SiLU. This scenario presents a more difﬁcult
challenge than the one adopted by Q-Diffusion, which only accounts for the quantization of selected
operators such as convolution and linear layer. Hence, our setting more rigorously tests StepbaQ’s
robustness under comprehensive and demanding conditions. Note that for SDXL-Turbo, due to its
wide activation value ranges, the input prompt embedding is quantized to 16-bit instead to prevent
loss of conceptual information. The consuming linear layers take 16-bit prompt embedding and
output 8-bit activations; the weights are still quantized to 4-bit/8-bit as described.

Stable-Diffusion v1.5 [9]. We perform experiments on Stable-Diffusion v1.5, utilizing a DDIM
sampler with 20 sampling steps. We opt for DDIM over the default PNDM[38] sampler as our
empirical ﬁndings suggest that DDIM yields better results in a 20-step sampling setting. The results
are provided in Table 1, which indicate that our proposed correction technique enhances performance
in terms of FID and CLIP-score compared to simple post-training quantization. Speciﬁcally, for the
W8A8 setting, StepbaQ markedly improves FID by 4.35 on the MS-COCO dataset and 7.30 on the
SDprompts dataset. Meanwhile, PTQD, constrained by its limited applicability, achieves only modest
improvements of 0.33 and 0.16 in FID on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. For
the W4A8 setting, the impact of quantization error is profoundly detrimental, as evidenced by the
signiﬁcant deterioration in both FID and CLIP-score. In this scenario, StepbaQ dramatically reduces
the FID by 26.08 and 33.60 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. These results
underscore the efﬁcacy of StepbaQ, demonstrating its capability to substantially mitigate the adverse
effects of quantization error, even under challenging scenarios.

SDXL-Turbo [5]. To explore whether StepbaQ is compatible with few-step approaches, we conduct
experiments on SDXL-Turbo with 4 sampling steps, employing the default EulerAncestralDis-
creteScheduler (Euler-a) [1] (See Appendix C for implementation details). Experimental results are
presented in Table 1. Interestingly, SDXL-Turbo exhibits greater resilience to quantization errors
than SD v1.5. As Euler-a is a stochastic sampler, the error absorption strategy proposed by PTQD is
applicable in this setting. The results show that both PTQD and StepbaQ signiﬁcantly improve the

quality of the generated images under the challenging W4A8 condition, with StepbaQ outperforming
PTQD. StepbaQ’s improvements, which reduce the FID from 44.76 to 23.92 and from 45.45 to 28.14,
effectively eliminate the visual artifacts associated with quantization errors, as shown in Fig. 7.

Ablation Study. To assess the contribution of each component of StepbaQ, we perform an ablation
study on Stable-Diffusion v1.5 under the W8A8 setting. Table 2 details the results of the ablation
study, examining individual components such as Temporal Information Alignment (TIA), Latent
Adjustment (LA), Step Size Adaptation (SSA), and Error Accumulation (ACC). The results indicate
that mere adjustments to the temporal embedding yield only marginal improvements. In contrast,
simultaneous corrections to both temporal embedding and latent variables lead to more substantial
enhancements. The result also underscores the critical role of the step size adaptation. Correcting the
step size results in signiﬁcant FID improvements of 2.27 and 2.99 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts
datasets, respectively. Finally, accounting for error accumulation enables the model to achieve further
FID reductions of 1.20 and 3.22 on the MS-COCO and SDprompts datasets, respectively. This
highlights the value of considering error accumulation in improving model performance. Fig. 3 shows
the magnitude of stepback for SD v1.5 on the SDprompts dataset under the W8A8 setting. Without
considering error accumulation, steps with minor quantization errors are ignored, and therefore,
corrections are not applied until the ﬁnal six sampling steps. In contrast, StepbaQ, accounting for the
error accumulation across multiple steps, corrects the sampling steps more frequently. Notably, both
conﬁgurations exhibit a greater magnitude of stepback during the ﬁnal stages of the process. This
observation implies that the latter sampling steps are particularly susceptible to quantization errors,
conﬁrmed by the steep SNR curve as depicted in Fig. 2.

Comprehensive Comparative Results

To demonstrate the superiority of StepbaQ over existing approaches, we conduct a comparative
experiment against Q-diffusion [33], TFMQ-DM [24], and PTQD [20]. We select Q-diffusion as
the baseline and integrate StepbaQ and PTQD with it. The experiment is implemented based on the
codebase of Q-diffusion 2, adopting the exact quantization setting for fair comparison. It is important
to note that we deactivate the timestep-speciﬁc quantization parameters utilized in TFMQ-DM. While
the technique can potentially enhance the results, it can be regarded as an orthogonal strategy that
alters the quantization setting by introducing control of ﬁner granularity.

Stable-Diffusion v1.4 [8]. Table 3 provides the results of Stable-Diffusion v1.4 using DDIM sampler
with 20 sampling steps. Results show that StepbaQ surpasses previous works in terms of FID and
CLIP-score across all tested scenarios. Observations indicate that PTQD generally produces results
that are inferior to the Q-Diffusion baseline. Further examination revealed that the performance drop
is attributable to their strategy of correlated noise elimination, which depends on the correlation
between the model’s output and the quantization error. However, the observed R2 values are relatively
low, indicating a weak correlation. Consequently, the estimated k value utilized for correlated noise
elimination is unreliable and may inadvertently compromise the model’s performance. On the other
hand, TFMQ-DM outperforms Q-Diffusion only under the W8A8 setting through their temporal
information aware reconstruction. This limitation stems from their oversight of the distribution shift
in the latent space, which is a more critical issue for quantized diffusion models.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduce a novel aspect that considers the temporal shift in the latent space caused
by the quantization error as a "stepback" in the denoising process. We present how this temporal
shift would lead to deviation from the scheduled sampling trajectory and harm the performance
of quantized diffusion models. To address this issue, we propose StepbaQ, which corrects the
sampling steps to calibrate the sampling trajectory and alleviate quantization error accumulation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique, enhancing
the performance of a given quantized diffusion model without modifying its quantization settings.
The comparative result also demonstrates the superiority of StepbaQ over existing methods. Notably,
StepbaQ requires only statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset and can
be applied to both stochastic and deterministic samplers, demonstrating its applicability. However,
due to the design of the stepback mechanism, StepbaQ does not apply to single-step scenarios, such
as 1-step SDXL-Turbo. How to prevent performance drop of quantized diffusion model under a
single-step scenario is an area that requires further exploration in future research.

Broader Impact.

StepbaQ signiﬁcantly improves the performance of quantized diffusion models, thereby enabling
users to generate high-quality results even on computationally limited edge devices. While this
advancement broadens the accessibility of diffusion models to a broader audience, it also increases
the risk of these models being leveraged for malicious purposes.

Figure 4: The distribution of quantization errors collected under W8A8 setting.

A
Analysis of Quantization Error

Our assumption that quantization error follows a Gaussian distribution is inspired by the empirical
ﬁndings presented in PTQD [20], where the authors verify the Gaussian nature of quantization error
through statistical tests detailed in Appendix B of their paper. In our own empirical investigations, we
observed that the distribution of quantization error typically exhibits a symmetric, bell-shaped curve,
as depicted in Fig.4. This observation aligns with the result shown in Fig.3 of the PTQD paper.

To delve deeper into the characteristics of quantization error, we visualize the error distribution in
Fig.4 and present an analysis of both the kurtosis (Fisher) and skewness of the error distribution in
Table 4, averaged across all steps for each model under the W8A8 setting. Our ﬁndings indicate
that the skewness values are notably small, conﬁrming our observation that the quantization error
follows a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution. Regarding kurtosis, the values observed are greater
than zero for each model, suggesting that the distribution of quantization error exhibits relatively fat
tails. These fat tails likely originate from clipping errors, which occur less frequently but are more
signiﬁcant than rounding errors.

Although the quantization error exhibits higher kurtosis than a Gaussian distribution, our proposed
StepbaQ method still signiﬁcantly enhances the performance of diffusion models, as evidenced by
the results in Tables 1 and 3 of our main paper. This underscores the robustness and applicability of
our approach, demonstrating that StepbaQ can effectively improve model performance under realistic
conditions.

Discussion of Quantization Error as Stepback

Here, we provide another derivation of Eq. 8 from the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) perspective.
Combining Eq. 2 and Eq. 5, the quantized latent variable ˆxti can be expressed as:

ˆxti = xti + ∆i = √αtix0 +
p

1 −αtiϵ + ∆i
(9)

Given that the sum of two independent Gaussian random variables remains a Gaussian with mean
being the sum of the individual means and variance being the sum of the individual variances, the
quantized latent ˆx can be represented as:

ˆxti = √αtix0 +
q

1 −αti + σ2
i ϵ′,
ϵ′ ∼N(0, I)
(10)

From Eq. 5, it is evident that the quantization error ampliﬁes the variance of the quantized latent
variable ˆxti. This increase in variance, in turn, diminishes the SNR of the latent variable, which is
deﬁned as SNR = µ2

σ2 [40], resulting in:

SNR(xti) =
αti
1 −αti
,
SNR(ˆxti) =

(11)

Figure 5: The distribution of quantization error collected from W4A8 SDXL-Turbo on SDprompts
dataset, outliers are clipped by Tukey’s fence with k set as 1.7.

Since diffusion models exhibit an increasing SNR in the denoising process, this reduction in SNR
can be interpreted as a "stepback," as depicted in Fig. 2. Therefore, we can ﬁnd a step τi that better
aligns with the SNR of ˆxti, such that:

τi = arg min
j ∥SNR(xj) −SNR(ˆxti)∥,
j ∈[1, . . . , M]
(12)

This allows us to approximate ˆxti as if sampled from the distribution at the τi-th step. By reformulat-
ing Eq. 12 as follows:

τi = arg min

we arrive at the same objective described in Eq. 8.

C
Extending StepbaQ to SDXL-Turbo

We have demonstrated the application of StepbaQ to diffusion models using DDIM sampler in Sec. 4.
Here, we introduce several modiﬁcations to adapt StepbaQ for SDXL-Turbo, which employs the
EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler (Euler-a) as its sampler.

Statistical Analysis of Quantization Error. In our analysis of SDXL-Turbo’s quantization error,
we ﬁnd outliers with large values, making the distribution of quantization error very long-tailed. To
mitigate the inﬂuence of these outliers on the variance measurement, we employ Tukey’s fence [51],
empirically setting the value of k to 1.7, which effectively clips out these extreme values, as shown in
Fig. 5.

Finding the Corrected Step. The Euler-a scheduler determines the noise level at each step using the

equation σ(ti) =
q 1−αti

αti . To identify the corrected sampling step τi that more accurately represents
the noise level of the quantized latent variable ˆxti, we solve the following equation:

τi = arg min
j ∥σ(j)2 −(σ(ti)2 + σ2
i )∥,
j ∈[1, . . . , M]
(14)

where σ2
i represents the variance of the quantization error.

Temporal Information Alignment. As discussed in Sec. 4, the time embedding input provides
crucial information about the noise level to the noise prediction network. Aligning this temporal
information with the latent variable is generally beneﬁcial for improving noise prediction. However,
for SDXL-Turbo, aligning temporal information does not enhance model prediction. We hypothesize
that this is because the training procedure of SDXL-Turbo [46] involves only four selected steps. In
this case, correcting the temporal input would introduce inputs unseen during training. Therefore, we
deactivate the temporal information alignment component when integrating StepbaQ with SDXL-
Turbo.

---Page Break---
Latent Adjustment With Euler-a as its sampler, SDXL-Turbo rescales the latent variable x before
feeding it into the noise prediction network by a factor s(ti) (Eq.170 in [29]). To account for the
increased noise level in the quantized latent variable ˆxti, we use the scaling factor of the corrected
step s(τi), which more accurately reﬂects the noise level.

Step Size Correction The original step size deﬁned by Euler-a for the ti-th step moving toward
the target step with noise level σdown is deﬁned as σ(ti) −σdown. To accommodate the increased
noise level of the quantized latent variable ˆxti, we employ a larger step size, σ(τi) −σdown. This
adjustment ensures that the resulting noise level aligns with the intended target.

D
Qualitative Results

In this section, we present the qualitative results of our experiments. Figure 6 displays the outcomes
for SD v1.5, which is quantized using NeuroPilot on the SDprompts dataset under the W8A8 setting.
Compared to the results from Naive PTQ and PTQD, our proposed StepbaQ method effectively
addresses the inconsistent visual artifacts introduced by quantization errors while preserving the
overall structural integrity of the images.

Figure 7 illustrates the results for SDXL-Turbo, also quantized by NeuroPilot on SDprompts but
under the more challenging W4A8 setting. In this scenario, images processed with Naive PTQ display
noticeable crack-like artifacts. Both PTQD and StepbaQ manage to smooth these visual disturbances.
However, the images produced by StepbaQ demonstrate a higher degree of visual smoothness and
greater similarity to those generated by the ﬂoating-point model, underscoring the effectiveness of
StepbaQ.

Figure 8 shows the comparative results for SD v1.4 on SDprompts under the W4A8 setting. This
experiment was conducted using the Q-Diffusion codebase, which represents a less challenging
quantization scenario as described in Sec. 5.1. Despite the less pronounced differences in image
quality, StepbaQ consistently delivers results that more closely resemble those of the ﬂoating-point
model, avoiding the artifacts that are sometimes evident in outputs from other methods.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: We include all the claims and contributions in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: We include the limitations of the proposed approach in the conclusion section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is
low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justiﬁcation: We make assumption about the distribution of quantization error following
prior research, and provide complete proof of why the distribution shift caused by quantiza-
tion error can be considered as stepback.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: We provide information on the tool, codebase, data, and evaluation metrics
used in our experiments and also provide pseudo code with detailed information.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the
code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may be
necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset,
or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good
way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions
for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large
language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to
the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

21


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justiﬁcation: Currently, we cannot release the source code due to conﬁdentiality and
intellectual property concerns.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: We provide all the quantization settings and hyperparameters required in the
main paper and appendices.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropriate
information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justiﬁcation: We do not report error bars.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁdence
intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run
with given experimental conditions).

22


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not veriﬁed.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or ﬁgures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error
rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The information on computation resources is provided in the implementation
details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: We follow each point mentioned in the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special considera-
tion due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: We include the Broader Impacts section in our paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact
or why the paper does not address societal impact.

23


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g.,
deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc groups),
privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a
generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that
generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mecha-
nisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback
over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: Our paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety ﬁlters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: We include references of every code, data, or model used in our paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service
of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of
a dataset.

24


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset
is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contribution
of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included
in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary signiﬁcantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
