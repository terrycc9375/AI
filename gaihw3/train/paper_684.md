Abstract

Cinematographers adeptly capture the essence of the world, crafting compelling
visual narratives through intricate camera movements. Witnessing the strides made
by large language models in perceiving and interacting with the 3D world, this study
explores their capability to control cameras with human language guidance. We
introduce ChatCam, a system that navigates camera movements through conversa-
tions with users, mimicking a professional cinematographer’s workflow. To achieve
this, we propose CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model for text-conditioned
camera trajectory generation. We also develop an Anchor Determinator to ensure
precise camera trajectory placement. ChatCam understands user requests and
employs our proposed tools to generate trajectories, which can be used to render
high-quality video footage on radiance field representations. Our experiments,
including comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches and user studies, demonstrate
our approach’s ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera
operation, showing promising applications in real-world production settings. We
will release the codebase upon paper acceptance.

Introduction

Cinematographers skillfully capture the essence of the 3D world by maneuvering their cameras,
creating an array of compelling visual narratives [8]. Achieving aesthetically pleasing results requires
not only a deep understanding of scene elements and their interplay but also meticulous execution of
techniques.

Recent progress of large language models (LLMs) [1] has marked a significant milestone in AI
development, demonstrating their capability to understand and act within the 3D world [29, 30, 87].
Witnessing this evolution, our work explores the feasibility of empowering camera control through
conversational AI, thus enhancing the video production process across diverse domains such as
documentary filmmaking, live event broadcasting, and virtual reality experiences.

Although the community has devoted considerable effort to controlling the trajectories of objects
and cameras in video generation approaches for practical usage [4, 82, 75, 28], or predicting similar
sequences through autoregressive decoding processes [35, 64], generating camera trajectories has
yet to be explored. This task involves multiple elements such as language, images, 3D assets, and,
beyond mere accuracy, necessitates visually pleasing rendered videos as the ultimate goal.

We propose ChatCam, a system that allows users to control camera operations through natural
language interaction. As illustrated in Figure 1, leveraging an LLM agent to orchestrate camera
operations, our method assists users in generating desired camera trajectories, which can be used to
render videos on radiance field representations such as NeRF [52] or 3DGS [36].

At the core of our approach, we introduce CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model that integrates
language understanding with camera trajectory generation. We train this model using a paired
text-trajectory dataset to equip it with the ability for text-conditioned trajectory generation. We also

3DGS [36].

propose an Anchor Determinator, a module that identifies relevant objects within the 3D scene to
serve as anchors, ensuring correct trajectory placement based on user specifications. Our LLM agent
parses compositional natural language queries into semantic concepts. With these parsed sub-queries
as inputs, the agent then calls our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator. It composes the
final trajectory with the outputs from these tools, which can ultimately be used to render a video that
fulfills the user’s request.

With comprehensive evaluations and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, our method
exhibits a pronounced ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera operation. Our
user studies further demonstrate its promising application prospects in actual production settings. In
summary, this paper’s contributions are as follows:

• We introduce ChatCam, a system that, for the first time, enables users to operate cameras
through natural language interactions. It simplifies sophisticated camera movements and
reduces technical hurdles for creators.
• We develop CineGPT for text-conditioned camera trajectory generation and an Anchor
Determinator for precise camera trajectory placement. Our LLM agent understands users’
requests and leverages our proposed tools to complete the task.
• Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing how AI can
effectively collaborate with humans on complex tasks involving multiple elements such as
language, images, 3D assets, and camera trajectories.

Related Work

Multimodal Language Models. Large-scale language models (LLMs) [9, 19, 17, 1, 70] enabled by
extensive datasets and model size, have demonstrated surprising emerging abilities. The emergence
of multimodal models [43, 42, 33] is captivating as they can process text alongside other modalities
such as images [25], audio [27], and videos [78]. Some unified models can perceive inputs and
generate outputs in various combinations of text, images, videos, and audio [51, 68, 77, 86]. LLMs
hold the potential to act as agents [76, 80, 62], allowing them to be driven by goals, reason about their
objectives, devise plans, utilize tools, and interact with and gather feedback from the environment.
Our proposed method involves multiple modalities including language, images, 3D fields, and camera
trajectories, and utilizes LLMs as agents to assist users in operating cameras.

Radiance Field Representations. Utilizing continuous 3D fields modeled by MLPs and volumetric
rendering, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [52] achieved breakthrough for novel view synthesis.

From outside the window, enter the bedroom and explore its 
layout following an S-shaped path.

Observation: The user is requesting a camera trajectory, starting from a location outside the window 
and then covering the bedroom’s layout following an S-shaped path.

Reasoning: I need to find a starting point outside the window, then move through the window into 
the room and capture the room using an S-shaped path. Additionally, I should use a smooth panning 
speed to better showcase the room’s layout.

2. Call CineGPT with “pan 
straight forward, smooth 
panning speed”.

3. Call CineGPT with “an

4. Connect output trajectories 
from steps 2 and 3, ensuring 
they pass through the anchor 
point determined in step 1.

5. Ask the user for further 
clarification if needed.

6. Render a video using the

reasons the user’s request and devises a plan to generate a trajectory using our proposed CineGPT and

trajectory and render a video.

Subsequent research has emerged to improve NeRFs and broaden their applications [69], including
enhancing rendering quality [5, 6, 7? , 47], modeling dynamic scenes [84, 55, 58, 71, 74, 10, 22, 2? ],
improving computational efficiency [83, 23], and facilitating 3D scene editing [45, 84, 73, 34, 46, 40].
Replacing the deep MLPs with a feature voxel grid network has demonstrated enhancement in
both training and inference speed [13, 66, 24, 54]. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting [36] has
further advanced visual quality and rendering efficiency. Compared to traditional 3D representations,
radiance field representations offer superior photorealistic rendering quality, therefore, this study
focuses on camera manipulation upon mainstream radiance field representations such as NeRF or
3DGS.

3D Scene Understanding. Early methods for 3D semantic understanding [32, 67, 79, 15] primarily
focused on the closed-set segmentation of point clouds or voxels. NeRF’s capability to integrate
information from multiple viewpoints has spurred its application in 3D semantic segmentation [88,
20, 46, 53, 65, 26, 60, 31, 48, 49, 21]. Among these, [40, 37, 12] combine image embeddings from
effective 2D image feature extractors [41, 11, 59, 39] to achieve language-guided object localization,
segmentation, and editing. [21] proposes semantic anisotropic Gaussians to simultaneously estimate
geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward pass. Another line of research integrates
3D with language models for tasks such as 3D question answering [3], localization [14, 57, 81],
and captioning [16]. Additionally, [29, 30, 87] propose 3D foundation models to handle various
perception, reasoning, and action tasks in 3D environments. However, the AI-assisted operation of
cameras within 3D scenes remains an unexplored area.

Trajectory Control and Prediction. Controlling the trajectories of objects and cameras is crucial to
advance current video generation approaches for practical usage. TC4D [4] incorporates trajectory
control for 4D scene generation with multiple dynamic objects. Direct-a-Video [82], MotionCtrl [75],

and CameraCtrl [28] manage camera pose during video generation; however, they are either limited to
basic types or necessitate fine-tuning of the video diffusion model. Moreover, these approaches require
user-provided trajectories, whereas we, for the first time, generate camera trajectories conditioned on
text.

Method

Figure 2 provides an overview of our method’s pipeline. ChatCam analyzes the user’s camera
operation instruction and devises a plan to generate a trajectory using our proposed CineGPT and
Anchor Determinator. Finally, an AI agent utilizes the outputs from these tools to compose the
complete trajectory.

3.1
Text-Conditioned Trajectory Generation

To enable text-conditioned trajectory generation, we collect a text-trajectory dataset and introduce
CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model integrating language and camera trajectories. Illustrated
in Figure 3 (a), our method quantizes camera trajectories into a sequence of trajectory tokens using
a trajectory tokenizer. Subsequently, a multi-modal transformer decoder is employed to convert
input tokens into output tokens. Upon training, our model adeptly generates token sequences based
on user-provided text prompts. These sequences are then de-quantized to reconstruct the camera
trajectory.

Camera Trajectory Parameterization. For each single frame, our camera parameters include
rotation R ∈R3×3, translation t ∈R3, and intrinsic parameters K ∈R3×3. We further convert the
rotation matrix R into the S2 × S2 space [89] to facilitate computational efficiency and simplify the
optimization process. The total M-frame camera trajectory is formulated as:

c1:M = {ci}M
i=1 = {(Ri, ti, Ki)}M
i=1.
(1)

To additionally model the velocity of camera movement, we introduce a global parameter t represent-
ing the total duration. Consequently, the instantaneous velocity of each frame can be approximated
by the relative translation and rotation to the previnous frame over unit time.

Text-Trajectory Dataset. Given the scarcity of readily available data on camera operations, we
manually constructed approximately 1000 camera trajectories using Blender [18]. These trajectories
encompass a diverse range of movements, including various combinations of translations, rotations,

4

focal lengths, and velocities. Each trajectory is accompanied by a human language description
detailing the corresponding movements. This dataset spans various scenarios, capturing both simple
pan-tilt-zoom motions and more complex trajectories mimicking real-world scenarios.

Trajectory Tokenizer. We leverage a trajectory tokenizer based on the Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) architecture [72] to represent camera trajectories as discrete tokens. Our
trajectory tokenizer consists of an encoder E and a decoder D. Given an M-frame camera trajectory
c1:M = {ci}M
i=1, the encoder E encodes it into L trajectory tokens z1:L = {zi}L
i=1, where L = M/l
and l is the temporal downsampling rate. The decoder D then decodes z1:L back into the trajectory
ˆc1:M = {ˆci}M
i=1. Specifically, the encoder E first encodes frame-wise camera parameters c1:M
into a latent vector ˆz1:L = E(c1:M), by performing 1D convolutions along the time dimension.
We then transform ˆz1:L into a collection of codebook entries z through discrete quantization. The
learnable codebook Z = {zi}K
i=1 consists of K latent embedding vectors, each with dimension d.
The quantization process Q(·) replaces each row vector with its nearest codebook entry, as follows:

zi = Q(ˆzi) = arg min
zk∈Z ||ˆzi −zk||2
2,
(2)

where || · ||2 denotes the Euclidean distance. After quantization, the decoder projects z1:L back to the
trajectory space as the reconstructed trajectory ˆc1:M = D(z1:L). In addition to the reconstruction
loss, we adopt embedding loss and commitment loss similar to those proposed in [85] to train our
trajectory tokenizer. With a trained trajectory tokenizer, a camera trajectory c1:M can be mapped to
a sequence of trajectory tokens z1:L, facilitating the joint representation of camera trajectory and
natural language for text-conditioned trajectory generation.

Cross-Modal Transformer. We utilize a cross-modal transformer decoder to generate output tokens
from input tokens, which may consist of text tokens, trajectory tokens, or a combination of both.
These output tokens are subsequently converted into the target space. To train our decoder-only
transformer, we denote our source tokens as Xs = {xi
s}Ns
i=1 and target tokens as Xt = {xi
t}Nt
i=1. We
feed source tokens into it to predict the probability distribution of the next potential token at each
step pθ(xt|xs) = Q

i pθ(xi
t|x<i
t , xs). The objective function is formulated as:

LLM = −

Nt
X

i=1
log pθ(xi
t|x<i
t , xs).
(3)

By optimizing this objective, we aim to equip CineGPT with the ability to capture intricate patterns
and relationships within the data distribution. We then fine-tune CineGPT on supervised trajectory-
language translation leveraging our paired text-trajectory dataset, where the input for this stage can
either be a camera trajectory or a text description, while the target is the opposite modality. During
inference, CineGPT can generate camera trajectories solely from textual descriptions as inputs.

3.2
Object-Centric Trajectory Placement with Anchors

While CineGPT enables text-conditioned trajectory generation, its generation process solely fo-
cuses on determining the camera’s movements, without contextual connection to specific scenes.
Consequently, CineGPT alone cannot effectively handle user prompts that involve object-centric
descriptions, such as directives like “directly above the Sydney Opera House”. In this light, we bridge
trajectory generation with each underlying scene with “anchors” serving as reference points within
the scene to achieve more accurate placement of trajectories, as illustrated in Figure 3 (b).

Our anchor determination procedure takes natural language descriptions of an image as input. This
procedure identifies a set of camera parameters that can render an image that best matches the given
description. Current 3D visual grounding approaches [57, 81] typically entail learning a 3D feature
field [40, 37] and localizing objects within the scene, which often results in high computational
costs. In contrast, our anchor determinator adopts a different strategy. Initially, it selects the input
image that best matches the given text description as an initial anchor. Subsequently, an anchor
refinement process is employed to iteratively improve upon this initial anchor, ultimately yielding
the final anchor. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to traditional methods, reducing
computational overhead while still achieving accurate scene anchoring.

Initial Anchor Selector. Since our method leverages radiance field representations to render videos,
we naturally have access to the input images for training the 3D scene representations. We utilize

5


---Page Break---
an initial anchor selector based on CLIP [59] to choose the image from these input images that best
matches the text prompt. To be specific, for i-th input image Ii, we extract their CLIP image features
and convert the text prompt T into a CLIP text feature. Next, we compute the cosine similarity
between the CLIP text feature vector and each of the CLIP image feature vectors. We select the best
matching image with the highest cosine similarity score as the initial anchor. This can be formulated
as:

ianchor = arg max
i
fimage(Ii) · ftext(T)
∥fimage(Ii)∥∥ftext(T)∥,
(4)

where fimage(·) and ftext(·) represent the image and text feature extractor, respectively.

Anchor Refinement. Using the camera parameters canchor associated with the selected image
as initialization, we further minimize the following objective to obtain the final anchor camera
parameters:

min
c
Lanchor(c) = −fimage(R(c)) · ftext(T)

∥fimage(R(c))∥∥ftext(T)∥,
(5)

where R(·) is the rendering function and c is initialized with canchor. The optimization of c is
performed using gradient descent, with the update rule given by:
ct+1 = ct −η∇cLanchor(ct),
(6)
where η is the learning rate. The optimization typically achieves convergence within 100 to 1000
steps. This refinement process ensures that the camera parameters are adjusted to better match the
text prompts, handling cases where the initial input images do not align well with the prompts.

3.3
Trajectory Generation through User-Friendly Interaction

With our proposed CineGPT and anchor determination, a large language model acts as an agent
to interpret the user’s requests, generates a plan to use various tools, and composes a final camera
trajectory. We adopt GPT-4 [1] to interpret users’ natural language inputs and subsequently produce
trajectory prompts. Specifically, we use a carefully designed prompt to instruct the LLM agent
to reason about the user’s requirements and devise a plan consisting of the following steps: 1)
Break down the complex text query into sub-tasks that CineGPT and the Anchor Determinator can
effectively handle. 2) Use these tools to generate atomic trajectories and determine anchor points. 3)
Compose the final trajectory by concatenating atomic trajectories and ensuring they pass through the
anchors.

Observing, Reasoning, and Planning. Research indicates that LLMs can be prompted to decompose
complex goals into sub-tasks, essentially thinking step-by-step [76]. As illustrated in Figure 2, we
begin by instructing the agent to describe its observations, providing a summary of the current
situation. The agent then uses this summary to reason and develop a mental scratchpad for high-
level planning. Finally, it outlines specific steps to achieve the overarching goal of generating the
user-required camera trajectory.

Utilization of Proposed Tools. We inform our agent of the expected input and output format, i.e.,
the APIs, of our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator, and instruct the agent to interact with
them following the given format. In its outlined specific steps to generate the user-required camera
trajectory, it first calls CineGPT and Anchor Determinator to obtain atomic trajectories and anchor
points, respectively. Note that both tools can be called multiple times, and multiple atomic trajectories
can later be concatenated into final trajectories that pass through all anchor points correctly.

Final Trajectory Composition. Here we explain how to combine atomic trajectories from CineGPT
with anchor points to form the final trajectory. The agent first decides the role of the anchors in the
ultimate trajectory, either as a starting point or an ending point of some atomic trajectory. Then affine
transformations are applied to the respective atomic trajectories to ensure that their starting or ending
points align with the anchor points. For the remaining atomic trajectories not controlled by anchor
points, affine transformations are applied to make the endpoint of the previous trajectory align with
the starting point of the subsequent trajectory.

The remaining sub-layers and embeddings have a dimensionality of 256. We train CineGPT using
the Adam optimizer [38] with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. It takes approximately 30 hours to
converge. Our anchor determination utilizes CLIP [59] with a ViT-B/32 Transformer architecture.
The learning rate of anchor refinement is 0.002. By default, we use GPT-4 [1] as our LLM agent, and
its prompt will be released with our codebase. We render final videos using 3DGS [36] as the 3D
representation.

Tested Scenes.
We tested our method on scenes from a series of datasets suitable for 3D recon-
struction with radiance field representations, including: (i) mip-NeRF 360 [6], a real dataset with
indoor and outdoor scenes. (ii) OMMO [50], a real dataset with large-scale outdoor scenes. (iii)
Hypersim [61], a synthetic dataset for indoor scenes. (iv) MannequinChallenge [44], a real dataset
for human-centric scenes. If camera poses associated with images were not provided, we used
COLMAP [63] for camera pose estimation. For each scene, we reconstructed using all available
images without train-test splitting.

Baselines. As the first method to enable human language-guided camera operation, there is no
established direct baseline for comparison. Therefore, we adopt 3D understanding approaches
based on radiance field representations to let the LLM agent attempt to select a series of images
corresponding to the input text from input images and interpolate their camera poses to construct
camera trajectories. These methods include LERF [37], utilizing CLIP embeddings, and SA3D [12],
utilizing SAM embeddings.

Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the accuracy of the generated trajectories, we manually construct
ground truth trajectories and compute the mean squared errors (MSEs) of translations and rotations
relative to them. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate the rendered videos using generated
camera trajectories, where users are asked to select the video with the best visual quality and best
alignment with the input text.

Results

As shown in Figure 4, our method demonstrates the ability to understand and execute camera operation
instructions on a range of complex indoor and outdoor scenes, giving appropriate translation, rotation,
and focal length. Our method also understands more technical terms such as dolly zoom, which
creates a special visual effect by zooming the camera out while adjusting the focus. In Figure 5 we
further showcase the qualitative results of our method in human-centric scenes. Our method can
correctly handle user instructions about specific people and create correct and vivid visual effects.

Comparisons. In Figure 6 we qualitatively compare our method with LLM agents utilizing SA3D or
LERF to locate target objects. The baselines do simple interpolation of keyframes because they have
no knowledge about camera trajectories and tend to move the camera to unreasonable spots (such as
entering an object). Therefore, the video rendered by baselines contains artifacts and is not correctly
consistent with the input text. However, our method achieves better visual quality and alignment with
input texts. Quantitative comparisons in Table 1 further prove that our method has better performance
and is preferred by users.

Ablation Study. We present our ablation study in Table 1. We evaluate the performance of our
method using different LLMs as agents. Our approach achieved the best accuracy using GPT-4 [1] as
the agent, better than GPT-3 [9] and LLaMA-2 [70].Without our proposed anchor determination, our
method cannot correctly place trajectories within 3D scenes, thereby being less accurate than our full
model.

Conclusion

This paper presents ChatCam, a system designed for camera operation through natural language
interactions. By introducing CineGPT, we bridge the gap between human language guidance and
camera control, achieving text-conditioned trajectory generation. Our proposed anchor determination
procedure further ensures precise camera trajectory placement. Our LLM agent comprehends users’
requests and effectively utilizes our proposed tools to compose the final trajectory. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatCam, showcasing its ability to collaborate with
humans on complex tasks involving language, images, 3D assets, and camera trajectories. ChatCam
has the potential to simplify camera movements and reduce technical barriers for creators.

Supplementary Materials for
ChatCam: Empowering Camera Control through Conversational AI

This supplementary document presents additional qualitative results and discusses the limitations and
societal impacts of our proposed approach.

A
Video

For better visualization of our reconstruction results, we create a set of video visualizations. We
highly recommend to watch supplementary_video.mp4 for more results.

Move the camera over the arm of the 
man with his arm raised, then pan to 
the guy and lady taking a selfie together.

Leap from the front of 

bulldozer to the back.

Quickly move back and forth in 

front of the plants and bikes.

Figure A: Additional qualitative results. (1)

Can you try sitting on 
one of the little stools?

Start from capturing everybody, 

then move closer to the man 

wearing the red shirt.

Facing the piano, pull the camera 

back, then glance over at the TV 
on the left, and back to the piano.

Figure B: Additional qualitative results. (2)

B
Additional Results

We present additional qualitative results in Figure A and Figure B.

C
Limitations

As the first AI-assisted system for language-guided camera operation, our method relies on LLMs as
agents, and therefore its efficiency depends on LLMs. With the rapid development of the community,
this limitation may be alleviated.

16


---Page Break---
Our current results are limited to static scenes due to the limited availability of high-quality 4D
Dynamic NeRF/3DGS data. Extending our approach to a dynamic scene would be straightforward by
introducing a timestamp in the Anchor Determinator. We leave this as one of our future work.

D
Societal Impacts

Our approach has great potential to help creators in industries such as television, movies, games,
etc. reduce their burden by simplifying the learning costs of utilizing 3D assets like radiance field
reconstructions. This allows content creators to focus on their creations. We must also admit that
as existing 3D assets become more and more abundant, it is inevitable that there will be harmful
content in them, and our method may contribute to the creation of harmful content. We encourage the
community to play wisely with ChatCam.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .
• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.
• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",
• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.
• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction state the contributions made in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations in appendix.

18


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We fully describe our proposed pipeline and core building components.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

19


---Page Break---
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We will release the data and code upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include implementation details for our experiments, to a level of detail that
is necessary to appreciate the results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe in detail how we obtain quantitative metrics in our experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We indicate the type and number of GPUs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

21


---Page Break---
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed in appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

22


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We credit all such assets by appropriate citations and statements.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [Yes]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper includes details about its user study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not pose such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
