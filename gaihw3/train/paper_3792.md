Abstract

We present a novel diffusion-based approach for coherent 3D scene reconstruction
from a single RGB image. Our method utilizes an image-conditioned 3D scene
diffusion model to simultaneously denoise the 3D poses and geometries of all
objects within the scene. Motivated by the ill-posed nature of the task and to
obtain consistent scene reconstruction results, we learn a generative scene prior by
conditioning on all scene objects simultaneously to capture the scene context and
by allowing the model to learn inter-object relationships throughout the diffusion
process. We further propose an efficient surface alignment loss to facilitate training
even in the absence of full ground-truth annotation, which is common in publicly
available datasets. This loss leverages an expressive shape representation, which
enables direct point sampling from intermediate shape predictions. By framing
the task of single RGB image 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional diffusion
process, our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
12.04% improvement in AP3D on SUN RGB-D and a 13.43% increase in F-Score
on Pix3D.

Introduction

Figure 1: Given a single RGB image of an indoor scene, our model reconstructs the 3D scene
by jointly estimating object arrangements and shapes in a globally consistent manner. Our novel
diffusion-based 3D scene reconstruction approach achieves highly accurate predictions by utilizing
a novel generative scene prior that captures scene context and inter-object relationships, and by
employing an efficient surface alignment loss formulation for joint pose- and shape-synthesis.

Holistic 3D scene understanding is crucial for various fields and lays the foundation for many
downstream tasks in robotics, 3D content creation, and mixed reality. It bridges the gap between
2D perception and 3D understanding. Despite impressive advancements in 2D perception and 3D
reconstruction of individual objects [56, 5, 12, 38], 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB
observation remains a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature, heavy occlusions, and the

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

complex multi-object arrangements found in real-world environments. While previous works [15,
32, 33] have shown promising results, they often recover 3D shapes independently and thus do not
leverage the scene context nor inter-object relationships. This leads to unrealistic and intersecting
object arrangements. Additionally, common feed-forward reconstruction methods [48, 77, 37]
struggle with heavy occlusions and weak shape priors, resulting in noisy or incomplete 3D shapes,
which hinders immersion and hence limits the applicability in downstream tasks. To address these
challenges and to advance 3D scene understanding, we propose a novel generative approach for
coherent 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image. Specifically, we introduce a new
diffusion model that learns a generative scene prior capturing the relationships between objects in
terms of arrangement and shapes. When conditioned on a single image, this model simultaneously
reconstructs poses and 3D geometries of all scene objects. By framing the reconstruction task as
a conditional synthesis process, we achieve significantly more accurate object poses and sharper
geometries. Publicly available 3D datasets [47, 62] typically only provide partial ground-truth
annotations, which complicates joint training of shape and pose. To overcome this, we propose
a novel and efficient surface alignment loss formulation Lalign that enables joint training of shape
and pose even under the lack of full ground-truth supervision. Unlike previous methods [48, 77]
that involve costly shape decoding and point sampling on the reconstructed surface, our approach
employs an expressive intermediate shape representation that enables direct point sampling from the
conditional shape prior. This provides additional supervision and results in more globally consistent
3D scene reconstructions. Our method not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by
12.04% in AP15
3D on SUN RGB-D [62] and by 13.43% in F-Score on Pix3D [64] but also generalizes
to other indoor datasets without further fine-tuning.
In summary, our contributions include:

• A novel diffusion-based 3D scene reconstruction approach that jointly predicts poses and
shapes of all visible objects within a scene.
• A novel way for modeling a generative scene prior by conditioning on all scene objects
simultaneously to capture scene context and inter-object relationships.
• An efficient surface alignment loss formulation Lalign that leverages an expressive intermedi-
ate shape representation for additional supervision, even in the absence of full ground-truth
annotation.

Related Works

The task of 3D scene reconstruction from a single view combines the fundamental domains of
2D perception and 3D modeling into a unified challenge of holistic 3D understanding. Given the
multi-faceted nature of the task, we are providing a comprehensive overview of the relevant research
directions and contextualizing our contributions.

2.1
Single-View 3D Reconstruction

Object Reconstruction.
Since the foundational work by Roberts [54], numerous methods have
been developed to learn cues for deriving 3D object structures, thereby bridging the gap between
2D perception and the 3D world. These methods typically involve an image encoder network that
processes the input image of a single object, capturing its features. The extracted features are either
correlated with an encoded shape database to retrieve a suitable shape [32, 33, 17], or used by a 3D
decoder to reconstruct the object in a specific 3D representation, such as voxel grids [8, 72], point
clouds [14, 43], meshes [70, 66], or neural fields [73, 27]. [19] uses a message-passing graph network
between geometric primitves to reason about the structure of the shape.

Scene Reconstruction.
Early works formulated single-view scene reconstruction as 3D scene
completion from given or estimated depth information [63, 10, 78, 9] in a volumetric grid. While
these methods have produced promising results, their representational power to model fine details is
limited by the spatial resolution of the 3D grid. Multi-object reconstruction and scene parsing methods
represented objects using primitives [13, 23], voxel grids [68, 35, 52], or CAD models [26, 24], while
also considering the relation between the objects [31]. The approach presented by Nie et al. [48] is
particularly relevant, proposing a holistic method for joint pose and shape estimation from a single
image. Zhang et al. [77] extended this idea by incorporating an implicit shape representation and

2


---Page Break---
an additional pose refinement using a graph neural network. Although these methods provided
significant advances in holistic scene understanding, they struggled with accurate pose estimation
and produced noisy scene objects, leading to intersecting or incomplete objects. In contrast to these
previous works, we are proposing a generative method to obtain a strong scene prior and formulate
the reconstruction task as a conditional synthesis task. This allows for more robust reconstruction
that is less prone to object insections or implausible object geometries.

2.2
3D Diffusion Models

In recent years, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as a versatile class
of generative models, demonstrating impressive results in image and video generation. Unlike other
classes of generative models such as auto-regressive models [46, 75, 59], Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) [71, 79] and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models iteratively reverse
a Markovian noising process. This method ensures stable training and has the ability to capture
diverse modes while producing detailed outputs. Several approaches have utilized diffusion models to
learn the distribution of individual 3D shapes using various 3D representations, including volumetric
grids [6, 7, 25], point clouds [42, 74], meshes [2], implicit functions [30], neural fields [45, 58, 29]
or hybrid representations [80, 76]. [53] propose a hierarchical voxel diffusion model, which is
capable of modelling large-scale and fine-detailed geometry. While these methods can synthesize
high-quality 3D shapes, they typically focus on single objects in canonical space. In contrast, we are
proposing a diffusion-based approach that addresses the more challenging problem of multi-object
scene reconstruction, encompassing accurate pose estimations and an understanding of inter-object
relationships.

Conditional Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction.
Recent works also use diffusion models for
single-view object reconstruction [6, 7, 44]. For instance, [65] learns the shape distribution of a single
category by denoising a set of 2D images for each object, while [44] projects image features onto
noisy point clouds during the diffusion process to ensure geometric plausibility. Recently, several
works proposed to leverage multi-view consistency within pre-trained text-conditional 2D image
diffusion models to reconstruct individual 3D objects [38, 51, 57]. Similar to our work, Tang et
al. [67] use a diffusion model to learn scene priors from synthetic data, showing unconditional scene
synthesis of a single room type and text-conditional generation. However, their approach does not
support image-based scene reconstruction. Furthermore, it depends on clean synthetic data, which
provides full 3D ground truth supervision and CAD model retrieval, thereby limiting shape diversity.
While these existing methods have shown promising results on single objects or synthetic scenes, our
approach targets real-world scenes. By framing the reconstruction task as a conditional generation
process, our scene prior accurately delivers poses and shapes of multiple objects, even in the presence
of strong occlusions, significant clutter, and challenging lighting conditions.

Method

3.1
Overview

Our method takes a single RGB image of an indoor scene as input and generates a globally consistent
3D scene reconstruction that matches the input image. To this end, we are framing the reconstruc-
tion task as a conditional generation problem using a diffusion model conditioned on the input
view (Sec. 3.2), which simultaneously predicts the poses (Sec. 3.3) and shapes (Sec. 3.4) of all objects
in the scene. Given the ill-posed nature of single-view reconstruction, such a probabilistic formulation
is particularly well-suited for this task. To ensure accurate reconstructions and to learn a strong scene
prior, we model inter-object relationships within the scene using an intra-scene attention module
(Sec. 3.5). Additionally, recognizing the incomplete ground truth in many 3D indoor scene datasets,
we introduce a loss formulation for joint shape and pose training, which enables training under only
partially available supervision (Sec. 3.6). An overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the
following sections, we describe each individual contribution in more detail.

3.2
Conditional 3D Scene Diffusion

We frame the scene reconstruction task as a conditional generation process via a diffusion formula-
tion [22]. Given an instance-segmented RGB image I containing a variable number of 2D objects bi

Figure 2: Scene Prior and Surface Alignment Loss Overview. (Left) We propose a novel way to
model scene priors (Sec. 3.5) by modeling the scene context and the relationships between all objects
during the denoising process. (Right) For additional supervision and joint training, we use a surface
alignment loss (Sec. 3.6) between a given ground truth depth map and point samples directly drawn
from the intermediate shape representation ˆσi and transformed to camera space with the predicted
object pose ˆρi.

for i ∈{1, . . . , n}, our model Φ simultanteously estimates all 3D objects oi = (ρi, σi) with 7-DoF
poses ρi and 3D geometries σi:

(ˆo1, . . . , ˆon) = Φ(I|(b1, . . . , bn)).
(1)

During the forward process, we gradually add Gaussian noise to a data point x0 to xT over a series of
discrete time steps T. For a given data point x0, e.g., shapes σi and poses ρi, the noisy version xt at
time step t is given by a Markovian process [22, 60] q(xt|xt−1) and its joint distribution q(x1:T |x0)
can be expressed as:

q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt;

q(x1:T |x0) =

with t ∈[1, T] and βt a pre-defined linear variance schedule.

During the reverse process, the denoising network Φ tries to remove the noise and recover x0 from
xT as pΦ(xt−1|xt, y)

pΦ(xt−1|xt, y) = N(xt−1; µΦ(xt, t, y), ΣΦ(xt, t, y)),

with y being the conditional information from the input image I.

Conditioning.
To effectively guide the diffusion process pΦ(x0:T |y), it is crucial to accurately
model the conditional information y. First, we encode the input image I using a 2D backbone ΘI and
apply 2D instance segmentation to get n detected 2D objects bi, comprising of its 2D bounding box,
image feature patch, and semantic class (cls). Each element is encoded using a specific embedding
function Θ. The per-instance yi and scene condition y is then formed as:

yi = concat(Θbox(boxi), Θfeat(feati), Θcls(clsi)),
(6)
y = (y1, . . . , yn).
(7)

To learn a scene prior over all objects in the scene, we condition the denoising network on the scene
condition y. This not only enables learning the individual object representations oi but also facilitates
learning to capture the scene context and inter-object relationships (Sec. 3.5). Furthermore, we adopt
classifier-free guidance [21] for our model by dropping the condition y with probability p = 0.8, i.e.,
using a special 0-condition ∅. This allows our model to function as a conditional model pΦ(x0|y) and
unconditional model pΦ(x0) at the same time, thus enabling unconditional synthesis (Appendix B).

Loss Formulation.
Unlike related works like [23, 48, 77] that regress object poses ρi and shape
parameters σi using a multitude of highly-tuned losses, we train our model Φ to minimize simple
diffusion and alignment losses:

Ljoint(I) = Lpose(I) + Lshape(I) + λLalign,
(8)
Lpose(I) = Eϵ∼N(0,1),t∥ˆϵρ(˜ρ(t), t, I, b) −ϵ∥,
(9)

Lshape(I) = Eϵ∼N(0,1),t∥ˆϵσ(˜σ(t), t, I, b) −ϵ∥,
(10)

where we define ˜z(t) = √¯αtz + √1 −¯αtϵ for z ∈{ρ, σ} with pre-defined noise coefficients ¯αt,
while ˆϵz denotes the predicted noise. We use λ = 0.01 to balances the effect of Lalign.

Due to the lack of full ground truth supervision in publically available 3D datasets, we introduce an
additional alignment loss Lalign for joint training of pose and shape (Sec. 3.6). Depending on the
availability of ground-truth data (see Sec. 4.2, we mask out individual losses.

3.3
Object Pose Parameterization

We adopt the object pose parameterization of [23], defining the pose ρi = (ci, si, θi) of an object by
its 3D center ci ∈R3, the spatial size si ∈R3, and orientation θi ∈[−π, π) in . The 3D center ci is
further represented by the 2D offset δi ∈R2 between the 2D bounding box center coordinate and the
projected coordinate of the 3D center on the image plane, along with the distance di ∈R from the
object center to the projected center. Our model learns to denoise this 7-dim. pose representation.

3.4
Shape Encoding

We represent object shapes using the disentangled shape representation from [20]. A shape is
represented as a shape code σi ∈R256 which is factorized into a set of g oriented, anisotropic 3D
Gaussians Gj, j ∈{1, ..., g} and an associated 512-dim. latent feature vector per Gaussian. Each
Gaussian consist of 16 main parameters: µj ∈R3 (center), factorized covariance matrix Uj ∈R3×3

(rotation), λj ∈R3 (scale) and πj ∈R1 (“mixing” weight). We use g = 16 Gaussians to form a
scaffolding of the shape’s geometry. Together with their latent features, these Gaussians are decoded
into high-fidelity occupancy fields, and the final mesh is extracted by applying marching cubes [40].

While similar to [30], our model learns to denoise this shape parameterization σi, our additional
surface alignment loss Lalign (Sec. 3.6) provides relational signal between predicted shapes and poses.
This enables additional guidance in the face of missing joint pose and shape annotations as in SUN
RGB-D dataset [62].

3.5
Scene Prior Modeling

Given the ill-posed nature of single-view reconstruction, a robust scene prior is essential for achieving
good performance. Effectively capturing the scene context and modeling the relationships between
objects within the scene is crucial for learning this strong scene prior [31, 77]. Previous methods either
reconstruct each object individually [15] or refine their features using graph networks [77]. In contrast,
our approach considers the entire scene by conditioning on all scene objects simultaneously pΦ(x0|y)
and y = (y1, . . . , yN) and additionally allows objects to exchange relational information throughout
the entire process. We model the inter-object relationships using an attention formulation [69], which
has proven to be powerful for aggregating contextual information.
We denote this formulation as Intra-Scene Attention (ISA), which allows all objects within the scene
to attend to each other, effectively modeling their relationships. Please refer to Appendix E for more
details and to Tab. 2 for the corresponding ablation study, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our learned scene prior.

3.6
Surface Alignment Loss

Publically available 3D scene datasets often only provide partial ground-truth annotations [47, 62].
To facilitate joint training of our model on pose and shape estimation, even in the absence of complete
ground-truth annotations, we propose to leverage our expressive intermediate shape representation

5


---Page Break---
to provide additional supervision and to align shapes efficiently with the available partial depth
information D. An illustration of the surface alignment loss formulation is provided in Fig. 2.
During training, for each object oi, we use the expected shape code ˆσi estimation by our model to
obtain the predicted Gaussian ˆGi,j distribution. Given this scaffolding representation, we directly
sample m = 1000 points p(j,l) ∼N(µj, Σj) per Gaussian ˆGi,j resulting in a shape point cloud
Pi = {p(j,l)|j ∈{1, . . . , g}, l ∈{1, . . . , m}}. We transform the resulting shape points Pi into the
camera frame by the predicted object pose ˆρi. Using the instance segmentations and ground-truth
depth maps, we obtain Ki surface points qi
k for object oi and define the surface alignment loss for all
visible objects as 1-sided Chamfer Distance [16, 48]

Unlike previous works such as [48] that perform costly sampling of points on the decoded shape
surface, our approach enables direct point sampling from the conditional shape prior ˆGi,j. This loss
formulation facilitates joint training of pose and shape for all objects simultaneously and its efficancy
is demonstrated through ablation studies in Tab. 2.

3.7
Architecture

Our architecture consists of a pre-trained image backbone, a novel image-conditional scene prior
diffusion model, and a conditional shape decoder diffusion module. We utilize an off-the-shelf
2D instance segmentation model, Mask2Former [5], which is pre-trained on COCO [36] using a
Swin Transformer [39] backbone, to obtain instance segmentation and image features. Please refer
to Appendix E for details about the condition embedding functions.
To denoise object poses ρi, we use a 1-dim. UNet [55] architecture with 8 encoding and decoding
blocks with skip connections. Each block consists of a time-conditional ResNet [18] layer, multi-head
attention between the per-object condition yi and the pose representation, and our intra-scene attention
module (Sec. 3.5) to enable relational information exchange and effectively train a scene prior. We
use 8 attention heads, with 64 features per head.
To estimate object shapes σi from the input view I, we denoise the unordered set of Gaussian Gi,j
using a Transformer [69] model with 2 encoder layers, 6 decoder layers, and multi-head attention
with 4 heads to the object condition information, similar to [30]. The per-Gaussian latent features are
denoise with a shape decoder diffusion model, realized as another Transformer model with 6 encoder
and decoder layers, which is conditioned on the shape Gaussians.

3.8
Training and Implementation Details

For all diffusion training processes, we uniformly sample time steps t = 1, ...T, T = 1000, and use a
linear variance schedule with β1 = 0.0001 and βT = 0.02. We implement our model in PyTorch[50]
and use the AdamW [41] optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999. We
train our models on a single RTX3090 with 24GB VRAM for 1000 epochs on Pix3D, for 500 epochs
on SUN RGB-D and for 50 epochs of additional joint training using Lalign.
During inference, we employ DDIM [61] with 100 steps to accelerate sampling speed. For classifier-
free guidance [21], we drop the condition y with probability p = 0.8.

Experiments

In the following sections, we will demonstrate the advantages of our method and contributions by
evaluating it against common 3D scene reconstruction benchmarks.

4.1
Baseline Methods

We compare our method against current state-of-the-art methods for holistic scene understanding:
Total3D [48], Im3D [77], and InstPIFu [37]. Total3D [48] directly regresses 3D object poses from
image features and uses a mesh deformation and edge-removal approach [49] to reconstruct a shape.
Im3D [77] utilizes an implicit shape representation and a graph neural network to refine the pose

6


---Page Break---
predictions. InstPIFu [37] focuses on single-object reconstruction and proposes to query instance-
aligned features from the input image in their implicit shape decoder to handle occlusion. For
scene reconstruction, they rely on the predicted 3D poses of Im3D. We use the official code and
checkpoints provided by the authors of these baseline methods and evaluate with ground truth 2D
instance segmentation and camera parameters to ensure a fair comparison. We further compare
against a retrieval-based method, ROCA [17] in Appendix D.

4.2
Datasets

Following [23, 48, 77], we train and evaluate the performance of our 3D pose estimation on the
SUN RGB-D [62] dataset with the official splits. This dataset consists of 10,335 images of indoor
scenes (offices, hotel rooms, lobbies, furniture stores, etc.) captured with four different RGB-D
cameras. Each image is annotated with 2D and 3D bounding boxes of objects in the scene. During
joint training, we use the provided depth maps together with instance masks to compute Lalign.
We train and evaluate the performance of our 3D shape reconstruction on the Pix3D [64] dataset,
which contains images of common furniture objects with pixel-aligned 3D shapes from 9 object
classes, comprising 10,046 images. We use the train and test splits defined in [37], ensuring that 3D
models between the respective splits do not overlap.

4.3
Evaluation Protocol

For quantitative comparison against baseline methods, we follow the evaluation protocol of [48]. For
pose estimation, we report the intersection over union of the 3D bounding box (IoU3D) and average
precision with an IoU3D threshold of 15% (AP15
3D) on the SUN RGB-D dataset [62]. In line with
previous works [48, 77], we evaluate with oracle 2D detections but also provide camera parameters
to all methods during evaluation. To further assess the alignment of the 3D shapes in the scene, we
calculate Lalign between reconstructed shapes and the instance-segmented ground-truth depth map.
For single-view 3D shape reconstruction, we follow evaluate on the Pix3D [64] dataset. We fol-
low [37] and sample 10,000 points on the predicted shape surface, extracted with Marching Cubes [40]
at a resolution of 1283, and on the ground truth shapes and evaluate Chamfer distance (CD ×103)
and F-score after mesh alignment.

4.4
Comparison to State of the Art

3D Scene Reconstruction.
In Fig. 3, we present qualitative comparisons of our approach against
state-of-the-art methods for single-view 3D scene reconstruction. The results from Total3D often
exhibit intersecting objects and lack global structure. Additionally, their deformation and edge-
removal approach results in 3D shapes with visible artifacts and limited details. While the implicit
shape representation of Im3D is more flexible, it often produces incomplete and floating surfaces. In
contrast, our diffusion-based reconstruction method, as shown in Tab. 1, learns strong scene priors,
resulting in a +0.2 improvement in Lalign and more coherent 3D arrangements of the objects in the
scene (+12.04% AP15
3D), as well as high-quality and clean shapes (+13.43% F-Score).
Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of our model to other indoor datasets. We evaluate
our approach on individual frames from the ScanNet [11] dataset using 2D instance predictions from
Mask2Former without additional fine-tuning. As shown in Fig. 4, our method accurately reconstructs
the given input view with matching poses and high-quality 3D geometries.
In Appendix D, we additionally train on ScanNet and compare against ROCA [17]. Due to its retrieval
approach, the shapes are complete. However, the resulting quality can limited by the diversity of the
shape database, which can lead to suboptimal results, see Fig. 11.

3D Pose Estimation & Scene Arrangement.
As shown in Tabs. 1 and 6, our method outperforms
all baseline methods by a significant margin in terms of IoU3D and AP15
3D, i.e., improving mAP15
3D
by 12.04% over Im3D [77]. Detailed per-class results are provided in Tabs. 6 and 8. Figs. 3 and 7
demonstrate that our approach effectively learns common object arrangements, such as multiple
chairs surrounding a table, while ensuring that furniture pieces do not intersect or float in the air.
We attribute these improvements to our model’s robust scene understanding, which is derived from
learning a strong scene prior that accounts for inter-object relationships.

3D Object Reconstruction.
In Tab. 1, we quantitatively compare the single-view shape
reconstruction performance of our approach against baseline methods on the Pix3D dataset. The
results demonstrate that modeling single-view reconstruction as conditional generation over a robust
shape prior leads to significant improvements in Chamfer Distance (+9.6%) and F-Score (+13.43%).
Detailed per-class results can be found in Tabs. 7 and 9. Fig. 9 illustrates that InstPiFU often
reconstructs noisy and incomplete shapes. In contrast, our approach produces clean 3D geometries
with fine details, such as thin chair legs and the crease between pillows of a sofa.

In Fig. 5, we show unconditional results by injecting ∅as a condition (Sec. 3.2), showcasing that our
shape prior models detailed and diverse shape modes across several semantic classes. In Fig. 10, we
additionally visualize the shape decomposition capabilities resulting from our shape encoding and
the scaffolding Gaussian representation.

4.5
Ablations Studies

We conduct a series of detailed ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our design decisions and
contributions. The quantitative results are provided in Tab. 2.

What is the effect of the denoising formulation?
To assess the benefits of the denoising
diffusion formulation, we construct a 1-step feed-forward regression model that uses the same
conditional information as input features and model architecture but regresses the object outputs
directly in a single timestep. As shown in Tab. 2, modeling 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional
diffusion process, rather than using a feed-forward regression formulation, results in significant
improvements of +11.08% AP15
3D and +0.19 Lalign.

What is the effect of our scene prior modeling?
We evaluate the impact of learning a scene
prior by modeling the distribution of all objects and their relationships compared to learning the
marginal per-object distribution, i.e., predicting each object individually. As shown in Tab. 2, our
joint-object scene prior yields a significant improvement of +9.30% AP15
3D over per-object prediction.
This improvement underscores the importance of learning a robust scene prior that effectively captures
inter-object relationships.

What is the effect of joint training?
We investigate the benefit of joint training for pose and
shape using Lalign compared to individual training of pose estimation and shape reconstruction.
Although our model already learns strong scene and shape priors, Tab. 2 shows that joint training
provides additional benefits, resulting in an improvement of +2.11% in AP15
3D and +0.07 in Lalign.

baselines often produce noisy or incomplete shape reconstruction of intersecting or misplaced objects,
our method produces plausible object arrangements as well as high-quality shape reconstructions.

and perform inference on individual frames of ScanNet without fine-tuning. We observe strong
generalization capabilities with respect to different camera parameters and scene arrangements.

Limitations

While our conditional scene diffusion approach for single-view 3D scene reconstruction demonstrates
significant improvements, there are some limitations. First, our method relies on accurate 2D object
detection, making it dependent on the performance of 2D perception models. Upcoming state-of-the-
art 2D detection models [1] can be seamlessly integrated to enhance the performance of our approach.
Second, our shape prior, trained on a diverse set of semantic classes using 3D shape supervision, does
not generalize to unseen object categories. This can be mitigated by combining our model for known
categories with single-object diffusion models that leverage pre-trained text-image generation models
for 3D shape synthesis [38] of uncommon shape categories. While accurate 3D scene reconstruction

forms the foundation for subsequent downstream tasks like mixed reality applications, our current
model assumes a static scene geometry. Future work could integrate object affordance and articulation
into our shape prior [34] to enable more immersive human-scene interactions.

Broader Impact
We do not anticipate any societal consequences or negative ethical implications
arising from our work. Our approach advances the holistic understanding of 2D perception and 3D
modeling, benefiting various research areas.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based approach for coherent 3D scene reconstructions
from a single RGB image. Our method combines a simple yet powerful denoising formulation
with a robust generative scene prior that learns inter-object relationships by exchanging relational
information among all scene objects. To address the issue of missing ground-truth annotations in
publicly available 3D datasets, we introduce a surface alignment loss Lalign to jointly train shape
and pose, effectively leveraging our shape representation. Our approach significantly enhances 3D
scene understanding, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, with
+12.04% AP15
3D on SUN RGB-D and +13.43% F-Score on Pix3D. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our contributions – 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional diffusion process, scene prior
modeling, and joint shape-pose training enabled by Lalign – collectively contribute to the overall
performance gain. Additionally, we show that our model supports unconditional synthesis and
generalizes well to other indoor datasets without further fine-tuning. We believe these advancements
lay a solid foundation for future progress in holistic 3D scene understanding and open up exciting
applications in mixed reality, content creation, and robotics.

Appendix

In the following, we show more qualitative results for scene reconstruction on SUN RGB-D [62]
(Appendix B) and object reconstruction on Pix3D [64]. We provide detailed quantitative per-class
comparisons supplementing the tables in the main paper (Appendix C). We additionally compare
against a retrieval baseline on the ScanNet [11] dataset in Appendix D. Finally, we provide additional
details on the architecture of our diffusion model in (Appendix E).
For a comprehensive overview of our approach and results, we encourage the reader to watch the
supplemental video.

B
Additional Qualitative Results

Scene Reconstruction
In Fig. 6, we show additional qualitative results of our method on test
frames from SUN RGB-D. Despite strong occlusions and challenging viewing angles, our model
predicts accurate scene reconstructions. Our generative scene prior learns common scene patterns,
such as parallel object placements between the table and sofa or a bed and neighboring nightstands.
In Fig. 8, we also demonstrate that our robust conditional scene prior can recover clean and matching
shape reconstruction even for heavily occluded objects, e.g., a chair for which only the back seat is
barely visible.

Figure 6: Additional qualitative scene reconstruction results on SUN RGB [62]. Our diffusion-
based scene layout and shape prediction approach achieves accurate results even for strongly occluded
objects.

Object Reconstruction & Unconditional Synthesis
In Fig. 9, we show a qualitative comparison
of single-view 3D object reconstruction on the Pix3D dataset. Unlike InstPIFu, which often produces
noisy and incomplete surfaces, our image-condition diffusion model reconstructs clean and high-
fidelity objects. Such a visual quality allows these reconstructions to be integrated into e.g., mixed
reality applications.

To probe the learned shape prior and investigate its shape synthesis capabilities, we input the 0-
condition ∅instead of extracted image features to our model. As shown in Fig. 5, our model learns a
high-quality shape prior with fine details across various semantic classes.

Figure 7: Qualitative comparison of 3D pose estimation on the SUN RGB-D [62]. The input image
is displayed on the left, and the predicted and ground-truth 3D arrangements are visualized as top-
down orthographic views of the scene. We observe that Total3D frequently lacks a globally consistent
structure, while Im3D predicts globally structured results but occasionally produces intersecting or
floating objects. In contrast, our approach successfully recovers a coherent arrangement of objects
within the scene by learning a robust scene prior.

C
Additional Quantitative Results

Scene Reconstruction
In Tab. 4, we show detailed comparisons of our approach against baseline
methods, Total3D [48] and Im3D [77], on the 10 most common classes of SUN RGB-D. Our approach
consistently outperforms all baseline methods on all classes except the “bed” class. We attribute this
exception to the fact that beds are often only partially visible in the input view due to their spatial
extent, which introduces higher variability. In contrast, Im3D employs a series of geometric losses
and regularization terms, which seems to help in extreme amodal cases at the cost of additional loss
balancing. Nevertheless, our method achieves a significant overall improvement of 12.04% in AP15
3D
on these 10 classes, with particularly notable gains for “dressers” (+26.03%), “chairs” (+21.91%)
and “cabinets” (+19.37%), showcasing the effect of our robust scene prior.

Tabs. 6 and 8 show the per-class comparisons and ablation studies on all 37 NYU classes in terms
of IoU3D and mAP15
3D. Our approach improves compared to Im3D by a +7.57% increase in mAP15
3D
and +4.56% increase in class-mean IoU3D across all 37 classes. The ablation results highlight the
importance of our diffusion formulation (+7.67% mAP15
3D), scene prior modeling (+7.11% mAP15
3D),
and joint training using the surface alignment loss Lalign (+0.72 mAP15
3D).

Object Reconstruction
For single-view object reconstruction, we evaluate Chamfer Distance
and F-Score on Pix3D and show per-class comparisons in Tabs. 7 and 9. Our image-conditional
shape prior leads to significant improvements, +9.6% in Chamfer Distance and +13.43 in F-Score,
while outperforming InstPIFu in most categories, except sofas and wardrobes in F-Score.

Room Layout
[48, 77] also predict the room bounding box with a separate network head. We
study, how our model can also predict the room layout. For that we include the room bounding

16


---Page Break---
box pose as part of the object poses during the diffusion process. We follow the room layout
parameterization of [48, 77] and model the 3D room center directly instead of decomposing it as 2D
offset & distance, which is done for the objects. In Tab. 3, we demonstrate that by denoising the pose
of room layout, we outperform the regression-based methods.

Table 3: Additional 3D room layout estimation on SUN RGB-D [62]. We evaluate the 3D IoU of
the orientied room bounding box. Our diffusion-based pose estimation lead to an improvement of
+1.7% in Room Layout IoU.

Comparison to shape retrieval baseline on ScanNet

We compare with a shape retrieval baseline, namely ROCA [17]. Since ROCA requires full ground-
truth supervision during training, we adopt their setup and train our model on the same 25,000 frames
from the ScanNet [11] dataset with pose annotations derived from Scan2CAD [3], as well as the
same CAD pool from ShapeNet [4]. We additionally adopt their full 9-DoF pose parameterization by
predicting all 3 rotation angles. Following ROCA, we quantitatively evaluate the Alignment Accuracy
in Tab. 5. Please refer to [3, 17] for the details of the evaluation. In Fig. 11, we can see that ROCA
retrieves clean and complete shapes by definition. However, due to its limited shape database, it
cannot capture all shape modes accurately, leading to shape mismatches. Our reconstruction-based
approach instead can recover faithful shape results while simultaneously predicting a coherent object
arrangement.

Object Pose Parameterization: Normalization
To ensure a reasonable signal-noise ratio [28]
among the object pose parameters, we normalize the parameters to [−1, 1] by dividing them by its
max value and shift the range using a parameter-specific µ value. For this, we calculate the min-max
ranges of all pose parameters, i.e., rotation θ, 3D scale s, and projected distance d, within the train

During training, the loss is computed on the un-normalized parameter ranges. After inference and for

Surface Alignment Loss: Point Sample Transformation
During training, for each object oi,
we use the predicted shape ˆσi to estimate its scaffolding Gaussians ˆ
Gj. From each 3D Gaussian
distribution, we directly draw 3D point samples p(j,l) ∼N(µj, Σj). This shape point cloud Pi
approximates the shape. With the predicted and un-normalized object pose ˆρi, we define a 3D rigid
transformation R4×4 and transform the shape point cloud Pi to the camera coordinate system. We
use this transformed shape pointcloud P cam

and the instance-segmented ground-truth depth map from

shape. Our diffusion-based method derives faithful modes.

Scene Prior Modeling: Inter-Object Relationships via Intra-Scene Attention
We use the
multi-head attention mechanism [69] between the scene objects to allow them to attend to each
other, effectively learning their inter-object relationships and the scene context. Specifically, given
an unordered set S = [o1, o2, ..., on], oi ∈Rn per-object n-dimensional feature vectors, projection
layers (W Q, W K and W V ) and features Q = S × W Q, K = S × W K and V = S × W V after
projection. we define the intra-scene attention as:

ISA(S) = softmax(QKT

√dd
)V
(15)

Condition: Embedding Functions
After cropping the 2D image feature patch RW ×H×C from
the frozen image backone ΘI, we apply adaptive average pooling to resize the per-object feature
patches to a common 2D size leading to resized per-object feature crop of 8 × 8 and C = 256. This
feature crop is further embedded using a small 2D CNN Θfeat with 3 blocks of convolutional layers
with 512 features, group norm, and leaky ReLU activation. The embedded feature crop is reshaped to
a 4096-dim vector.

Θbox is implemented as sinusoidal position encoding with 10 frequencies. This function is applied on
a 2D bounding box, represented by the top-left and bottom-right corners, leading to an 84-dim vector
per object. For Θcls, we use a simple 1-hot encoding to embed the semantic class information. The
final per-object condition information is the concatenation, resulting in a 4127-dim vector for each
object.

airplanes), we re-implement the training procedure, loss function, and disentanglement loss following
the description in the papers to train the full shape prior over all relevant shape categories. Random
geometric augmentations are essential during training to achieve self-supervised disentanglement into
extrinsic and intrinsic shape properties. We apply full 360-degree random rotations, uniform scale
augmentation between 0.7 and 1.3, and translation jitter of ∓0.3 on the disentangled extrinsic and
target pointcloud. Further, we do not utilize the symmetry options of the original implementation.

consists of 3 sub-parts: An image-conditioned diffusion model, denoising the 3D Gaussians; a 3D

which takes as input a 3D point coordinate and the denoised extrinsics & intrinsics and outputs an
occupancy value indicating whether the 3D point is inside/outside of the shape.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide experimental results demonstrating the performance improve-
ments by following the evaluation protocol of common 3D scene reconstruction bench-
marks (Tab. 1). We further ablate the impact of the individual contributions — denoising
formulation, scene prior modeling, and surface alignment loss in Tab. 2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of our approach in Sec. 4.6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not introduce new theorems. We provide an empirical evaluation
of our model through a series of experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed description of the architecture in Sec. 3.7, Appendix E
and implementation instructions in Sec. 3.8.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

24


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We will release the code after cleaning up and documenting it for easy usage.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We give detailed explanations of training and test details in Secs. 3.7 and 3.8
and Appendix E. We use common data splits for training and testing (Sec. 4.2) and follow
the evaluation protocols of [48, 37] (Sec. 4.3).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Given limited computational resources, we are not able to train multiple models
using different initializations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Sec. 3.8, we explain the setup (hardware, training duration) to train our
models. Given the rich design space of the challenging task of single-view 3D scene
reconstruction, we conducted a wide range of experiments to reach the performance of the
presented work. However, we did not keep track of the total compute of all individual runs.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Sec. 4.6, we discuss why we do not anticipate any negative impacts of our
work on single-view 3D scene reconstruction.

26


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our model only relies on a 2D instance segmentation model, which was
pre-trained on COCO.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For training and testing, we use multiple publically available datasets, namely
SUN RGB-D [62], Pix3D [64], and ScanNet [11], which were properly explained and cited
in the main paper (Sec. 4.2).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

27


---Page Break---
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Use the official train/test splits of publically available datasets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not perform research with human subjects, nor did the data
pre-processing and experiments require crowdsourcing tasks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not perform research with human subjects, nor did the data
pre-processing and experiments require crowdsourcing tasks.

28


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
