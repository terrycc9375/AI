Abstract

Imperceptible adversarial attacks aim to fool DNNs by adding imperceptible pertur-
bation to the input data. Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility
of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed
perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper,
we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling frame-
work distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes
attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic
modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of reg-
ular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet
effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without
any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from
the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in
a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process,
AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower
overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is
proposed to evaluate the extreme of our novel framework under an ideal scenario.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and
AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves
an average of 99.9% (+17.3%) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) l2 distance, 49.74 (+4.76)
PSNR and 0.9971 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three dif-
ferent architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset. Code is available at

Introduction

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks [1, 2] (i.e., mali-
ciously crafted perturbations added to the input data), posing serious security concerns to real-world
applications [3]. The research of adversarial attacks also plays an important role in proactively ex-
posing potential threats, as well as promoting model robustness and corresponding defense methods
[4–11]. Many attacks [12–15] focus on maximizing the attack success rate and transferability under
relatively lenient restrictions (i.e., l∞or l2 norm) of adversarial perturbation, but they could have
poor stealthiness and imperceptibility since the crafted adversarial examples can be easily detected by
the Human Visual System (HVS) [16]. Therefore, imperceptible adversarial attacks [17–23], aiming
to maintain attacking efficacy while improving imperceptibility, have attracted considerable attention.

Current imperceptible adversarial attacks could be summarized into two categories: 1) perturbation-
based attacks devised on perceptual characteristics, and 2) unrestricted attacks. The first one is
motivated by the fact that adding adversarial perturbations to different components of an image has

varying perceptual quality levels to the HVS. By studying components such as image color [19],
texture complexity [21], frequency spectrum [23, 24], etc., these methods design corresponding
perceptual-based loss functions and incorporate them to the optimization process to craft adversarial
examples where the adversarial perturbation is constrained and hidden within specific image regions.
Instead of injecting noise-like adversarial perturbations, unrestricted attacks heavily but reasonably
modify attributes of images like semantic content to perform attacks. Apart from early work that
adopts GANs [25], some recent methods combine the prevalent diffusion models [26–28] into the
adversarial optimization process in an image edition-like way of repeatedly adding noise and denoising
to eliminate the noise pattern within the final adversarial examples [29, 30] or optimize the embedding
of latent diffusion models [31, 32]. However, due to the uncertainty of generative models and the
unrestricted setting itself, some unrestricted adversarial examples inevitably exhibit obvious unnatural
texture or semantic changes and lose the imperceptibility, especially for images with complex content.
Although previous methods have equipped attacks with imperceptibility utilizing various designs
mentioned above, it remains an essential challenge of achieving imperceptible adversarial attacks:
How to attack with inherently minimal perturbation strength from a modeling perspective?

To address this fundamental challenge, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a
brand new modeling framework distinct from common attack paradigms of gradient ascending [2] or
optimization with adversarial losses [17]. The proposed AdvAD explores a novel non-parametric
diffusion process for attacks, which fully inherits two key merits of diffusion models: i) the modeling
philosophy of converting a difficult task into a series of simple sub-tasks, and ii) solid theoretical
foundation. Specifically, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy with intrinsically lower perturbation
strength by innovatively modeling the attack process as a decomposed diffusion trajectory from
an initialized noise to an adversarial example. At each step, a much subtler (for imperceptibility)
yet more effective (for attack performance) adversarial guidance is calculated and injected with
two cooperating, theoretically grounded non-parametric modules called Attacked Model Guidance
(AMG) and Pixel-level Constraint (PC), which gradually leads the end of this trajectory from the
original image distribution to a desired adversarially conditioned distribution based on the theory of
diffusion models (e.g., deterministic diffusion[27], conditional sampling [33, 34], etc.).

Here, we would like to clarify that the proposed diffusion process for attacks is considered as
non-parametric since it does not require additional networks as needed in regular diffusion models
for noise estimation. AdvAD firstly initializes a fixed diffusion noise, which is then ingeniously
manipulated at each step via the adversarial guidance crafted by the proposed AMG and PC modules
using only the attacked model with theoretically derived equations. In this way, the proposed AdvAD
is facilitated with the modeling approach of diffusion models rather than their denoising or generative
capabilities, which avoids the negative impact like semantic content changes caused by the uncertainty
of generative models and also promises relatively low computational complexity. Based on AdvAD,
we further propose an enhanced version AdvAD-X (‘X’ for ‘eXtreme’) with two extra strategies
to squeeze the extreme performance in an ideal scenario of the proposed new modeling framework
with unique properties, which also possesses theoretical significance and provides new insights for
revealing the robustness of DNNs. In summary, our main contributions are:

• Addressing the essential challenge of imperceptible adversarial attacks from a novel modeling
perspective for the first time, we theoretically explore and derive the basic modeling of diffusion
models to perform attacks with inherently lower perturbation strength through a non-parametric
diffusion process that requires no additional networks.

• We propose two attack versions, AdvAD and AdvAD-X. For the basic AdvAD, the AMG and PC
modules cooperate to craft much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance which is progressively
injected via initialized diffusion noise at each step, and AdvAD-X further reduces the perturbation
strength to an extreme level in an ideal scenario with theoretical significance.

• Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in terms of attack
success rate, imperceptibility, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
the novel modeling approach for imperceptible adversarial attacks.

Preliminaries

Adversarial Attacks. Given an original image xori with ground-truth label ygt and a classifier f(·)
satisfying f(xori) = ygt, normal untargeted attacks aim to craft the adversarial example xadv that

2


---Page Break---
misleads the classifier, formulated as:

f(xadv) ̸= ygt,
s.t.∥xadv −xori∥p ≤ζ,
(1)

where ∥· ∥p represents lp-norm that is usually implemented with l∞-norm to limit the distance
between xadv and xori within an upper bound of budget ζ. In this paper, we focus on the more
general setting of untargeted attacks. More information on related work is provided in Appendix A.

Deterministic Diffusion Process. In the deterministic situation of DDIM [27] with σt = 0, for an
image x0 and pre-defined diffusion coefficients α0:T ∈(0, 1]T for step t ∈[0 : T], xt in the Forward
process of adding noise to x0 is given by xt = √αtx0 + √1 −αtϵ, where ϵ ∼N(0, I ) represents
Gaussian noise. For the Backward denoising steps, unlike the DDPM [26] based on Markov chains
that each state directly depends on the previous one, DDIM employs a non-Markovian approach. In
the backward process, each step first involves calculating a "prediction" of final step x0
t from current
xt, then adding noise to it again to obtain xt−1, expressed as:

xt−1 = √αt−1(xt −√1 −αtϵθ(xt)
√αt
) +
p

1 −αt−1ϵθ(xt),
(2)

where ϵθ(xt) is a estimated diffusion noise using a pretrained neural network θ for current step, and
the term in the first parenthesis represents the predicted x0
t, derived by a simple variation of Eq. (2).

Conditional sampling. Song et al. [34] propose the conditional sampling technique for the score-
based generative models with score function ∇xtlog p(xt) [35], a kind of generative model has close
relationship to diffusion models. Without loss of generality, for a condition y (e.g., class label, mask,
etc.) and corresponding conditional distribution p(x|y), a score-based model can sample from p(x|y)
by modifying the score function at each step of t to ∇xtlog(p(xt)p(y|xt)) if p(y|xt) is known.
Subsequently, with the connection between the score function and the noise ϵt of diffusion models as
∇xtlog p(xt) = −1/√1 −αtϵt [34], this joint distribution could be expanded to the deterministic
process of DDIM, achieved by updating the noise ϵt to ϵ′
t at each step as [33]:

ϵ′
t = ϵt −
√

1 −αt∇xtlog p(y|xt).

Proposed Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion

3.1
Overview

From a novel modeling perspective, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD) to
attack with inherently smaller perturbation strength through a non-parametric diffusion process for
the first time. As shown in Figure 1, different from previous attack paradigms that employ gradient
ascending or optimization with varying kinds of adversarial losses, AdvAD innovatively performs
attack within a decomposed non-parametric diffusion trajectory starting from an initialized noise, in
which very subtle yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted and injected to gradually push the end
of this trajectory to a desired adversarially conditioned distribution from the original image.

Intuitively, given the original image xori with an initialized Gaussian noise ϵ0 ∼N(0, I ), a fixed
diffusion trajectory from ¯xT to ¯x0 (¯x0 = xori) can be easily obtained using DDIM Backward for
the deterministic diffusion process as:

¯xT = √αT xori +
√

1 −αT ϵ0,
(4)

¯xt−1 = √αt−1( ¯xt −√1 −αtϵ0
√αt
) +
p

1 −αt−1ϵ0.
(5)

With this deterministic diffusion trajectory of the original image, performing adversarial attacks
within it requires solving two main problems: i) directing the final result of this diffusion process
to a desired adversarial example rather than the original image; ii) ensuring the modified trajectory
(denoted as ˆxt, ˆϵt for step t) close to the original trajectory (¯xt, ϵ0 for step t) of the clean image to
achieve the imperceptibility of attacks. To fulfill the dual purposes, we propose two theoretically
grounded modules, called Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) and Pixel-level Constraint (PC) to
work together. At each step, AMG utilizes only the attacked model f(·) to produce the adversarial
guidance without requiring any additional networks, synergistically collaborated with PC to constrain
and streamline the diffusion process injected with the guidances.

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD) that models the
attack as a non-parametric diffusing process. At each step, Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) module
adopts the non-Markovian process for approximating xadv using ˆx0
t to craft adversarial guidance
and injects it into the initialized diffusion noise, then Pixel-level Constraint (PC) module imposes
restriction to produce the noise for the next step and serves to control the whole process precisely.

3.2
Attacked Model Guidance Module

By viewing the attack process as a distribution-to-distribution transformation through a non-
parametric diffusion process, the proposed AMG module theoretically integrates the conditional
sampling technique of diffusion models to craft the adversarial guidance only using the attacked model
f(·). For untargeted attacks, the ultimate goal is modifying xori with f(xori) = ygt to xadv so that
f(xadv) ̸= ygt, which can be regarded as directing the determined distribution p(xori) of the original
diffusion trajectory to an distribution of xadv with the attacked model as p(xadv|f(xadv) ̸= ygt).
Thus, we regard f(xadv) ̸= ygt as an adversarial condition, and employ the conditional sampling
technique to the original trajectory by manipulating the diffusion noise to achieve this, expressed as:

ˆϵ′
t = ϵ0 −
√

1 −αt∇ˆxtlog p(f(xadv) ̸= ygt|ˆxt)

= ϵ0 −
√

1 −αt∇ˆxtlog(1 −p(f(xadv) = ygt|ˆxt)).
(6)

However, Eq. (6) is clearly unsolvable since xadv is unknown during the diffusing process. To
address this, inspired by the properties of deterministic non-Markovian DDIM that a final diffusion
result is firstly calculated at each step, we can calculate ˆx0
t via the equation of DDIM non-Markovian
process with ˆϵt+1 from the previous step, and use it to approximate xadv, expressed as:

xadv ≈ˆx0
t = ˆxt −√1 −αt ˆϵt+1
√αt
.
(7)

The accurate error upper bound and convergence of this approximation are given in Proposition 2
in conjunction with the proposed PC module, and the validity of this approximation can also be
explained intuitively from the premise of our method. That is, we have ¯x0
t = xori for all step t in the
original diffusion trajectory, and the modified trajectory should be very close to the original one, so
that the relationship between ˆx0
t and xadv should satisfy ˆx0
t ≈xadv.

With Eq. (7), the term of p(f(xadv) = ygt|ˆxt) in Eq. (6) can be written as p(f(ˆx0
t) = ygt|ˆxt) =
p(f(ˆx0
t) = ygt) since ˆx0
t is calculated from ˆxt, which is exactly the output logits of f(ˆx0
t) with
Softmax(·) function for the class ygt. Denoting this term as the classification probability of the
attacked model as pf(ygt|ˆx0
t), we can obtain the solvable equation of AMG module that injects
adversarial guidance to the initialized diffusion noise using only f(·) without any additional network:

ˆϵ′
t = AMG(ϵ0, ˆx0
t, f(·), ygt) = ϵ0 −
√

1 −αt∇ˆxtlog(1 −pf(ygt|ˆx0
t)).
(8)

At this point, in addition to the benefits from modeling, this calculation process of AMG also plays a
role in endowing AdvAD with imperceptibility. As the attack progresses, the probability pf, the term

of log(1 −pf) as well as coefficient √1 −αt gradually approach 0, which means the strength of
injected adversarial guidance gradually converge to 0 in AdvAD, while common classification losses
(e.g, Cross-Entropy, Log Loss, etc.) used in other attack paradigms will increase on the contrary.
Further analysis and experiments on this property are provided in Proposition 1 and Sec. 4.5.

3.3
Pixel-level Constraint Module

Collaborating with AMG, the PC is introduced to impose precise control and streamline the modified
diffusion trajectory for attacks. A straightforward choice is to design PC for ˆxt that constrains each
ˆxt using ¯xt, thus ensuring ˆx0
t close to ¯x0
t and the final xadv close to xori. However, such a "hard"
constraint directly applied to ˆxt will impair the effectiveness of AMG and disrupt coherence of the
transforming trajectory. Therefore, we formulate a more suitable PC for ˆϵt as in Theorem 1.

Theorem 1 Given diffusion coefficients αT :0 ∈(0, 1]T , the xori, ¯xt, ϵ0 from the original trajectory,
ˆxt, ˆϵt from the modified trajectory, and a variable ξ, if ˆϵt and ϵ0 satisfies

∥ˆϵt −ϵ0∥∞≤
√αT
√1 −αT
ξ,
(9)

for all t ∈[T : 1], then it follows that ∥ˆxt −¯xt∥∞≤(√αt −√1 −αt

√αT
√1−αT )ξ, ∥ˆx0
t −xori∥∞≤
ξ, and ∥ˆx0 −xori∥∞≤ξ hold true.

According to Theorem 1, the PC for ˆϵt is implemented as:

ˆϵt = PC(ˆϵ′
t) = Pl∞(ϵ0,
√αT
√

1−αT ξ)(ˆϵ′
t).
(10)

where Pl∞(ϵ,ξ)(·) is a projection operation that constrains the output ˆϵ′
t of AMG(·) to ˆϵt based on a
l∞-norm ball of ϵ0 to satisfy Eq. (9). After PC, the diffusion noise ˆϵt for next step is obtained, and
the ˆxt−1 can be calculated using the deterministic DDIM backward equation as:

ˆxt−1 = √αt−1( ˆxt −√1 −αtˆϵt
√αt
) +
p

1 −αt−1ˆϵt.
(11)

The elaborate PC for ˆϵt directly cooperates with AMG to constrain the diffusion noise, which
streamlines the whole diffusion process and can serve to simultaneously control the terms of ˆxt,
ˆx0
t, and ˆx0, satisfying the premise that two trajectories are close and ensuring the effectiveness of
AdvAD. The complete pseudo code of AdvAD is provided in Algorithm 1.

Subsquently, based on Theorem 1, we further give two propositions about AdvAD as:

Proposition 1 Under the conditions of Theorem 1, by denoting constrained ˆϵt = ϵ0 −δt, we have

xadv = xori +

T
X

t=1
λtδt,
(12)

5


---Page Break---
where λt =
√1−αt
√αt
−
√

1−αt−1
√αt−1 , and ∥δt∥∞≤
√αT
√1−αT ξ.

Proposition 2 Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the upper bound on the error of the approximation
in Eq. (7) can be expressed as

xadv −ˆx0
t

∞≤2 ·
√1 −αt
√αt

√αT
√1 −αT
ξ.
(13)

Proposition 1 explicitly states the much subtler and decreasing strength of the adversarial guidance
injected at each step of AdvAD’s non-parametric diffusion process, and also allows for a quantitative
analysis (as in Sec. 5.5). Proposition 2 indicates the validity and convergence of the approximation
of xadv ≈ˆx0
t in AMG (Eq. (7)). It is evident that as t goes from T to 1, αt increases from 0 to 1, the
upper bound on the approximation error rapidly converge from 2ξ to 0. The detailed derivations of
the mentioned PC for ˆxt, proofs of Theorem 1 and Proposition 1, 2 are provided in Appendix B.

3.4
AdvAD to AdvAD-X: Extreme Version

Building upon AdvAD, we further propose a scheme called AdvAD-X (‘X’ for ‘eXtreme’) with two
extra strategies called Dynamic Guidance Injection (DGI) and CAM Assistance (CA), aiming to
squeeze the extreme performance of our novel modeling framework.

DGI and CA Strageties.
As aforementioned, the attack capability of AdvAD comes from the very
subtle yet effective adversarial guidance crafted by AMG and PC, and the intensity of guidance will
decrease to 0 as the process progresses. Thus, the DGI is naturally emerged as a dynamic skipping
stragety to skip the unnecessary calculation and injection of adversarial guidance, especially for those
steps in the later process. With DGI, AdvAD-X dynamically avoids the execution of AMG and PC
and adopts original ϵ0 as the diffusion noise for the steps where the ˆx0
t ≈xadv is already able to
mislead the attacked model, reducing the accumulated guidance strength as well as the computational
complexity. On the other hand, inspired by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) [36] identifies
critical regions of an image about a decision made of a classifier, our CA strategy calculates a mask (if
available) m ranging from 0 to 1 of xori with f(·) and ygt using GradCAM [37] to further suppress
the strength of adversarial guidance within the non-critical image regions in those steps that are not
skipped. The equation of AMG with CA strategy can be modified as:

ˆϵ′
t = ϵ0 −m ·
√

1 −αt∇ˆxtlog(1 −pf(ygt|ˆx0
t)).
(14)

Specific algorithm of AdvAD-X in pseudo code is provided in Appendix C.

Ideal Scenario.
Equipped with DGI, AdvAD-X omits a large number of adversarial guidance that
is injected by default in AdvAD, while the absolute strength of guidance in each of the remaining
steps are also suppressed by CA, successfully reducing the final adversarial perturbation to an extreme
level. This extreme case leads to a problem that in the default setting of attacking with 8-Bit RGB
images, the adversarial perturbation of pixels where the intensity is less than 0.5 will be erased due
to the quantization. However, in practice, the input of DNNs is normalized as floating-point data
type to avoid gradient problems during training [38, 39], and white-box attack allows access to the
entire of DNNs. Therefore, for AdvAD-X, we specifically consider an ideal scenario that is usually
overlooked but has theoretical significance. That is, directly input the raw final adversarial example in
floating-point data to DNNs without quantization to evaluate the extreme performance of AdvAD-X.

widely used CNNs of ResNet-50 [42] and enhanced ConvNeXt-Base [43], Swin Transformer-Base
[44] with Transformer [45] architecture, and VisionMamba-Small [46] with the recently emerged
advanced Mamba [47] architecture. Attacks. We choose classic PGD [12] and seven attacks
that claim having imperceptibility as comparison methods, including normal imperceptible attacks
of AdvDrop [21], PerC-AL [19], SSAH [24], and unrestricted attacks of NCF [40], ACA [32],
DiffAttack [31], Diff-PGD [30], and the generative capability of diffusion models are utilized the
last three attacks. For our proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X, we set ξ = 8/255 and T = 1000
for all experiments unless specifically mentioned. All the other comparison methods are evaluated
using their official open-source code with the default hyper-parameters. The results of AdvAD-X
are obtained in the ideal scenario with float-pointing raw data as described in Sec. 3.4. Evaluation
Metrics. Attack success rate (ASR) is used to evaluate the attack efficacy, and seven metrics are
adopted to comprehensively assess the imperceptibility, including l2 and l∞distances for absolute
perturbation strength; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structure Similarity (SSIM) [48], and
three network-based metrics, i.e., Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [49], Fréchet
Inception Distance (FID) [50], and a non-reference metric MUSIQ [51] for image quality.

4.2
Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods

White-Box Attacks.
Table 1 reports the untargeted attack performances and imperceptibility of ten
methods against four attacked models. It is evident that the proposed AdvAD with novel modeling
framework consistently demonstrates superior performance in terms of both ASR and imperceptibility.
For the normal imperceptible adversarial attacks, the absolute adversarial perturbation strength of
AdvAD in l∞and l2 distance are only 0.014 and 1.34 in average, which is about half of the state-
of-the-art imperceptible attack SSAH, while AdvAD maintains almost 99.9% ASR, supporting our
key idea that it inherently reduces the strength of perturbation required for attacks from a modeling
perspective. When attacking more advanced models from ResNet to VisionMamba, AdvAD always
demonstrates the best ASR and imperceptibility, while other methods tend to have some performance

degradation (e.g., PerC-AL and SSAH for ConvNeXt and VisionMamba). For unrestricted attacks,
it is expected for them to perform poorly in the quantitative metrics, but if the results are poor
for all image quality metrics, it usually indicates that the images are damaged. Meanwhile, since
the optimizer usually cannot find the global optimal solution, the optimization-based methods tent
to show sub-optimal ASR. For AdvAD-X, surprisingly, the perturbation strength is reduced to an
extremely low level with still high attack efficacy in the ideal scenario with floating-point raw data.

Visualization.
The visualization of adversarial examples againt ResNet-50 in Figure 2 clearly show
the characteristics of different imperceptible attacks against ResNet-50. For the first image with a
relatively simple and clear object, the unrestricted attacks of NCF, DiffAttack and ACA perform
attacks by modifying the semantics fairly, while DiffPGD uses denoising to avoid significant semantic
modifications, but often has lower ASR as in Table 1. However, for the image with complex content,
the unrestricted attacks result in obvious unnatural color, texture, and semantic changes and artifacts.
For the normal attacks with perceptual-based restrictions, by amplifying the noises, it can be seen
that AdvDrop has a obvious gridding effect due to the blocking operation in DCT operation, and the
perturbation strength in PerC-AL and SSAH is also related to the edge or texture components of the
image. In contrast, our AdvAD continuously maintains uniform and lower perturbation which is very
difficult to be seen even in the adversarial examples with ×5 noise. For AdvAD-X, the perturbations
are very slight modifications to the decimal places of the floating-point raw data for each pixel, thus
it is still difficult to be seen even after ×100 magnification. More quantitative comparisons and
visualizations are provided in Appendix D.1, D.2.

4.3
Robustness

The robustness of attacks is also evaluated against defense methods, including purification methods of
NRP [4], DS [52], diffusion-based purification [5] and adversarial training robust models of Inc-V3
[8], Res-50 [9], Swin-B [53], ConvNeXt-B [53]. Two classic image transformation defenses of JPEG
compression [54], Bit-depth reduction [55], and another type of defense, random smoothing [11], are
also included. Considering the robustness and transferability of attacks are comparable only under
close perturbation budget, the unrestricted attacks are not included in this and the next section.

As shown in Table 2, the proposed AdvAD demonstrates the best robustness in overall average
compared with other imperceptible attacks of AdvDrop, PerC-AL and SSAH. Specifically, when at-
tacking robust models, AdvAD achieved an much higher average ASR of 75.3%. For post-processing
purifications aim at eliminating adversarial perturbations, despite the inherently lower perturbation
strength, AdvAD still maintains the best or second-best ASR against different purifications, which is
comparable to AdvDrop with much higher perturbation strength. Similarly, for the results of classic
image transformation defenses in Figure 3, AdvAD also exhibits advantages in most of the factors.
In addition, since random smoothing is not a truly end-to-end method but a method that uses the base
model to make multiple predictions on noise-augmented images, we adpot a semi-white-box setup to
fully test the attack performance as described in the caption. Table 3 shows the experimental results,
and the PerC-AL is not included because it fails to attack in this setting. It can be seen that for all σ,
our AdvAD continuously achieves the best ASR with smaller perturbation strength.

Figure 4: More results of (a) effect of
step T on AdvAD and (b) transferability-
imperceptibility relationship of attacks.

We suppose the robustness of AdvAD mainly benefits
from two aspects. Firstly, AdvAD performs attacks during
a unique non-parametric diffusion process with adversar-
ial guidance, which may be easier to break through ex-
isting adversarial training models using common attack
paradigms. On the other hand, the inherently lower per-
turbation crafted by AdvAD is spread across the images
more uniformly rather than gathering in some areas as can
be seen in the visualization, making it more difficult to
be eliminated. For AdvAD-X, it is anticipated to exhibit
weak robustness since the extremely low perturbation in
the ideal scenario is easy to defense apparently.

4.4
Transferability and Effect of Step T on AdvAD

Table 4 reports the ASRs of black-box attacks and the
corresponding results of imperceptibility. We also test
AdvAD with different step of T for comprehensive evalua-
tion. Consistent with the diffusion models, a larger T denotes a finer decomposition granularity of the
entire process, corresponding to the strength of adversarial guidance at each step. Thus, AdvAD with
a larger T exhibits better imperceptibility, while a smaller T implies stronger black-box transferability.
Notbly, though there is a clear negative correlation between imperceptibility and transferability, our

AdvAD exceeds all comparison attacks in both of transferability and imperceptibility at different
comparable levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed novel modeling framework.

To further elaborate the relationship between transferability and imperceptibility of AdvAD, as
well as the optimal trade-off in practice, we plot two line graphs in Figure 4 under more values
of T. As shown in Figure 4 (a), as the value of T on the horizontal axis changes, the relationship
between imperceptibility and transferability shows a clear proportional trend mentioned above as
aforementioned, consistent across different surrogate models. For the optimal trade-off, we consider
that the intersection point of the two curves represents a balance between imperceptibility and
transferability. Accordingly, for the ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 models, the optimal values of T are
50 and 25, respectively. Moreover, Figure 4 (b) illustrates more direct curves of this relationship and
the positions of other comparison methods within it. Note that, all the other comparison methods are
located to the lower left of the curve of AdvAD. This indicates that our method consistently achieves
the best results in both transferability and imperceptibility compared with other state-of-the-art
restricted imperceptible attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our AdvAD as a new attack
paradigm with flexibility through the proposed non-parametric diffusion process.

Analysis

Eq. (12) in Practice. In Figure 5, we illustrate the values of λt and ∥δt∥∞of Eq. (12), and ∥δt∥∞is
calculated with 100 randomly selected images. While Proposition 1 indicates that the upper bound of
∥δt∥∞is invariant with respect to step t, the actual strength of the adversarial guidance produced
by AMG rapidly decreases as the process progresses, which validates the unique property given at
the end of Sec. 3.2. With the similarly decreasing λt, the whole term of λt∥δt∥∞representing l∞
distance of the guidance at step t also decreases from about 0.0008 to 0, supporting that the proposed
modeling framework performs imperceptible attacks with inherently small perturbation strength.
Performance with Smaller ξ. The results of AdvAD and AdvAD-X with smaller ξ for PC module
are shown in Table 5. As ξ decreases from 8 to 2, the imperceptibility is naturally improved because
of the upper bound of perturbation becomes lower, yet the ASR of 94.8% only drops slightly. When
ξ = 1/255, AdvAD still holds 87.4% ASR with 57.87 PSNR and 0.9993 SSIM, which means a
large number of examples still can fool the DNN with a maximum of ±1 modification for each pixel,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the adversarial guidance injected in the proposed diffusion process
for attacks. Moreover, we provide the ablation study of AdvAD-X and additional discussions in
Appendix D.3, D.4.

Conclusion and Outlook

In this paper, we propose a novel, fundamental modeling framework to tackle the challenge of
imperceptible attacks. By exploring and deriving basic theory of diffusion models, the proposed
AdvAD performs attacks through a non-parametric diffusion process with adversarial guidance,
achieving inherently lower overall perturbation strength with high attack efficacy from a modeling
perspective. Besides, the proposed AdvAD-X evaluates the extreme of this novel modeling framework
and further reduces the perturbation strength to an extremely low level in an ideal scenario. Extensive
experimental results support the effectiveness and progressiveness of the proposed methods. Beyond
imperceptibility, AdvAD holds the potential to become a general and extensible attack paradigm
thanks to the solid theoretical foundation and the innovative, controllable diffusion-based process
for attacks. In addition, we also hope the new observation that AdvAD-X can successfully attack
with extremely small perturbation using floating-point raw data can bring inspiration for revealing
the robustness and interpretability (e.g., decision boundaries) of DNNs.

Related Work

Beginning with the attack paradigm of Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [2], there are numerous
great works focusing on the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks have been proposed [17–23]. In
contrast to another line of attacks aimed at improving the attack success rate and the transferability
for black-box models with a more lenient limitation of perturbation strength [13–15], imperceptible
adversarial attacks are dedicate to accomplish attacks using as minimal perturbation as possible while
deceiving human perception. Among them, PerC-AL [19] improves the imperceptibility by alternating
between the classification loss and perceptual color difference when updating perturbations. AdvDrop
[21] uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to discard details in images that are imperceptible
for humans. SSAH [24] limits perturbation to high-frequency components using Discrete Wavelet
Transform (DWT) to make it undetectable. Similarly, AdvINN [22] also utilizes the DWT and exploits
invertible neural networks to specially perform targeted attacks. In addition, with an unrestriced
setting [25], some recent works have incorporated the capabilities of generative models (e.g., diffusion
models [26]) into common attack frameworks to make adversarial examples more natural and enhance
the imperceptibility. DiffAttack [31] and ACA [32] combine the optimization of adversarial losses
with the Stable Diffusion [28] to generate unrestricted adversarial examples, while Diff-PGD [30]
and AdvDiffuser [29] incorporate the classic PGD method [12] into the diffusion steps to make the
adversarial examples undergo denoising processing.

Compared to these traditional restricted imperceptible attacks or the recent unrestricted imperceptible
attacks (e.g., diffusion-based), the proposed AdvAD is a completely novel approach distinct from
existing attack paradigms. It is the first pilot framework which innovatively conceptualizes attacking
as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring fundamental modeling approach
of diffusion models rather than using their denoising or generative abilities, achieving high attack
efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower perturbation strength. Following the setting
of restricted attack, the modeling of AdvAD is theoretically derived from conditional sampling of
diffusion models, supporting its attack performance and imperceptibility, and does not require any
loss functions, optimizers, or additional neural networks.

Derivations and Proofs

In this section, we first introduce the specific straightforward Pixel-level Constraint (PC) for ˆxt that
is simply mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.3 of the main text as an intuitive preliminary, then
we provide the detailed proofs of Theorem 1 and Proposition 1, 2 given in the PC for ˆϵt.

B.1
Straightforward PC for ˆxt

For each known ¯xt in the fixed diffusion trajectory of the original image xori, and modified ˆxt in the
attacking trajectory with the proposed Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) leading to the adversarial
example xadv, the objective of PC is to control and constrain these two trajectories to be close,
ensuring the final ˆx0 (i.e., xadv) close to ¯x0 (i.e., xori). It is obvious that a straightforward way
to achieve the goal by directly constrain every ˆxt using ¯xt. Thus, in PC for ˆxt, we can utilize
the restriction of adversarial examples and the relationship between xadv, ˆx0
t and ˆxt to derive the
constraint for ˆxt. Given the budget ξ, the desired restriction of adversarial examples is

∥xadv −xori∥∞≤ξ.
(15)

Next, since the ˆϵt is unconstrained in the case of PC for ˆxt, we adopt the initialized ϵ0 to calculate
ˆx0
t approximating xadv as:

xadv ≈ˆx0
t(ϵ0) = ˆxt −√1 −αtϵ0
√αt
.
(16)

where α0 = 1, and α1:T ∈(0, 1]T is a pre-defined decreasing scalar sequence. And the ¯xt of the
original trajectory is calculated as:

¯xt = √αtxori +
√

1 −αtϵ0
(17)

15


---Page Break---
By substituting Eq. (16) and Eq. (17) into Eq. (15), the constraint for ˆxt can be easily derived, denoted
as:

ˆxt −√1 −αtϵ0
√αt
−¯xt −√1 −αtϵ0
√αt


∞
≤ξ

⇐⇒

ˆxt
√αt
−
¯xt
√αt


∞
≤ξ

⇐⇒∥ˆxt −¯xt∥∞≤√αt ξ

(18)

In this way, the PC for ˆxt can be implemented at the start of each step to achieve the basic restrictions
by employing a projection operation to ˆxt according to Eq. (18). However, this direct modification of
ˆxt at each step obviously disrupts the entire diffusion trajectory from noise to our desired adversarial
distribution, and can not achieve the final imperceptibility. Additionally, it is observed that the
estimation of ˆx0
t in each step employs a fixed ϵ0, impairing the adversarial guidance crafted by AMG.

B.2
Proof of Theorem 1

Therefore, we carefully analysis the important noise term in our diffusion-based modeling approach
for adversarial attacks, and present Theorem 1 to support our PC for ˆϵt as described in the main text.
The proof of Theorem 1 is provided as follow.

Theorem 1 Given diffusion coefficients αT :0 ∈(0, 1]T , the xori, ¯xt, ϵ0 from the original trajectory,
ˆxt, ˆϵt from the modified trajectory, and a variable ξ, if ˆϵt and ϵ0 satisfies

∥ˆϵt −ϵ0∥∞≤
√αT
√1 −αT
ξ,
(19)

for all t ∈[T : 1], then it follows that ∥ˆxt −¯xt∥∞≤(√αt −√1 −αt

√αT
√1−αT )ξ, ∥ˆx0
t −xori∥∞≤
ξ, and ∥ˆx0 −xori∥∞≤ξ hold true.

Proof 1 We prove Theorem 1 using mathematical induction.

Initial case.
For trajectories of the adversarial example xadv and original image xori that start
from ˆϵT +1 = ϵ0, ˆxT = ¯xT and ˆx0
T = ¯x0
T , we can unfold the formula for computing the ˆx0
T −1 with
the updated ˆϵT as:

ˆx0
T −1 =
ˆxT −1

ˆϵT

= ˆxT −√1 −αT ˆϵT
√αT
.
(20)

For ¯x0
T −1 from the fixed trajectory where ¯x0
t always equals to xori, we have:

¯x0
T −1 = ¯xT −√1 −αT ϵ0
√αT
= xori
(21)

With ˆxT = ¯xT , Eq. (20), Eq. (21), and the relationship of ∥ˆϵT −ϵ0∥∞≤
√αT
√1−αT ξ, we have:

∥ˆϵT −ϵ0∥∞≤

where the transition from Eq. (23) to Eq. (24) is obtained with the real constant value of αt. At this
point, it can be seen that Theorem 1 holds in the initial case.

Inductive step.
Assuming the theorem holds for some arbitrary step k, where T ≥k > 1, we have:

∥ˆϵk+1 −ϵ0∥∞≤
√αT
√1 −αT
ξ,
(26)

∥ˆx0

and

∥ˆxk −¯xk∥∞≤(√αk −
√

√αT
√1 −αT
)ξ.
(28)

Based on the inductive hypothesis, we next show the validity of the theorem at step k −1. Similar to
Eq.(20), we unfold the calculation of ˆx0
k−1 with ˆxk and ˆϵk as:

ˆx0
k−1 =

And the ¯x0
k−1 can be denoted as:

¯x0
k−1 = ¯xk −√1 −αkϵ0
√αk

(30)

Consequently, by substituting Eq. (29) and Eq. (30) into

where the triangle inequality property is utilized again to obtain Eq. (36) from Eq. (35), then Eq. (28)
and Eq. (34) is substituted to obtain Eq. (37). Obviously, for the case of step k−1, it is also consistent
with the theorem.

Conclusion.
Therefore, by extending the truth of the theorem from arbitrary step k to k −1, and
given its established validity at the initial case, the principle of mathematical induction allows us to
conclude that ∥ˆxt −¯xt∥∞≤(√αt −√1 −αt

√αT
√1−αT )ξ, ∥ˆx0
t −xori∥∞≤ξ hold true for every

step t ∈[1 : T]. For t = 0 and α0 = 1, we have ˆx0
0 = ˆx0 and ¯x0 = xori, thus it is obvious that
∥ˆx0 −xori∥∞≤ξ. This concludes the proof of the whole Theorem 1.

Proof of Proposition 1

Next, we prove Proposition 1 about λt and δt by expanding and rearranging the recursive formulas in
our diffusion process for attacks.

Note that in α0 = 1 Eq. (44), and the coefficients of ϵ0 can be mostly eliminated. Thus, by defining
λt as:

λt =

we can rearrange Eq. (44) into:

where ˆx0 is the final output of the diffusing process and xadv = ˆx0. This concludes the proof of
Proposition 1.

Proof of Proposition 2

Finally, we prove Proposition 2 about the validity and convergence of the approximation xadv ≈ˆx0

Proposition 2 Under the conditions of Theorem 1 and Proposition 1, the upper bound on the error

Additional Visualizations

More visualizations of adversarial examples and perturbations under the attacked model of ResNet-50
are displayed in Figure 6. The visualizations provide a clear insight into how different methods
accomplish imperceptible attacks. Our AdvAD and AdvAD-X methods execute imperceptible attacks
with lower overall intensity of perturbations. Notably, for images with salient objects (e.g., the bridge
in the second examples), the perturbation intensity of AdvAD also naturally increases in the object
regions during the gradient-based adversarial guidance calculation, while AdvAD-X, equipped with
the dynamic strategy, still shows uniform and lower overall perturbation intensity.

D.3
Ablation Study of AdvAD-X

From AdvAD to AdvAD-X, Table 7 shows the effect of the two strategies of CA and DGI. It can be
observed that adding CA in each step of AdvAD slightly improves impercepbility while maintaining
the attack success rate of 100%. However, the DGI strategy significantly reduces the iterations
of performing AMG and PC from 1000 to 3.97, which indicates that our framework theoretically
only requires very little injected adversarial guidance to successfully perform attacks, proving the
performance of our modeling method as well as the effectiveness of the adversarial guidance. In
AdvAD-X, which finally uses both CA and DGI, the guidance strength in each step is further
suppressed, resulting in a slight increase in the total number of iterations required adaptively, but the
final perturbation strength continues to decrease to a more extreme level.

Table 7: Ablation study of the proposed CAM Assistance (CA) and Dynamic Gradient Injection
(DGI) strategies in AdvAD-X. As marked with †, all the results in this experiment are obtained with
attacking normal ResNet-50 using the floating-point raw data to align with the setting of AdvAD-X.
The term of Iter. indicates the number of iterations that the AMG and PC are performed.

Additional Discussions

Discussion on Proposition 1. In the previous sections, we obtained Proposition 1 through extensive
derivations, which reformulates the AdvAD attack process using λt and δt. While this formulation
does not represent the actual attack procedure, it enables post-analysis after the completion of attacks.
In Proposition 1, although the upper bound of δt is theoretically independent of the step t, both δt
and the coefficient λt gradually decrease with t in quantitative results of Figure 5 due to the unique
properties of AdvAD. Thus, it emerges a hypothesis that whether modifying the coefficient of gradient
term of traditional attacks like PGD to decay incrementally could also achieve the imperceptibility.
To isolate the impact of this hypothesis, we conduct experiments with a modified version of PGD
with step size decay as:

xt−1 = Πξ{xt + λt · η · sign(∇xtLCE(f(xt), ygt))},
(53)

where λt is the same coefficient as in Eq. (39) of Proposition 1 for alignment, and η is a fixed small
factor for the initial step size. We have searched a lot of values of η to determine the optimal range,
and the results of attacking three models with different architectures under three typical values of η
are presented in Table 8.

It can be observed that for PGD with this strategy, the ASR is clearly proportional to η, the impercep-
tibility is inversely proportional to η. However, regardless of how η is adjusted, this strategy can not
simultaneously match AdvAD in both ASR and imperceptibility. Firstly, for η = 5e-5, when attacking
VisionMamba, ASR of this strategy is 10.5% lower than AdvAD with close PSNR, and the strategy
has a 0.2% higher ASR but a 5.09 dB lower PSNR for ResNet50. For η = 3e-5, the ASR against
VisionMamba and Swin further degrade, being 10.9% and 21.4% lower than AdvAD, respectively.
Finally, for η = 1e-5, the modified PGD with step size decay fails to attack all the models. Never-
theless, although this step size decay strategy performs worse than our AdvAD, it indeed enhances
the imperceptibility of attacks compared to the original PGD in some cases, which further validates
our motivation and modeling approach. This is because, while this strategy follows a completely
different technical route than AdvAD, it similarly uses subtler perturbations to progressively push
adversarial examples closer to the model’s decision boundary. To this end, we leave further research
on the potential of this strategy to future work.

Limitation. As the primary focus of AdvAD is the imperceptibility, although it achieves better
transferability at lower perturbation strength compared with other restricted imperceptible attacks,
its transferability is inevitably weaker than other black-box attack methods that operate in larger
perturbation spaces and are specifically designed for transferability (like the unrestricted ones).
However, the proposed AdvAD is essentially a general attack paradigm with a novel modeling
approach and a solid theoretical foundation. By relaxing the constraint of perturbation strength and
incorporating enhanced designs for the transferability into the proposed framework of non-parametric
diffusion process, AdvAD also has significant potential to be modified into a specific black-box
attack, and we also leave this aspect for future research.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the motivation, innovation, overview of methods, experimental
performance and the main contributions of our paper in the abstract and introduction. These
claims are further explained and verified in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, and detailed proofs are given
in Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For the proposed AdvAD that mainly focuses on the imperceptibility, we point
that there is a trade-off between the imperceptibility and transferability for the restricted
attacks. The relevant discussions and experimental results are given in Sec. 3.4, Sec. 4.3,
and Appendix D.4. Additionally, for the proposed AdvAD-X, although it shows amazing
performance under an ideal scenario using raw floating-point data for attacking and brings
theoretical value, the very small floating-point perturbations will be easily erased by the
quantization process when the image is actually stored.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best

25


---Page Break---
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The proposed attack method is built on a solid theoretical foundation, which is
derived from the derivation of the diffusion models. The specific methods and theoretical
properties are introduced in detail in Sec. 3, and the detailed proofs of the proposed theorem
and two propositions are given in Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present all the formulas, calculation processes, algorithms, and hyperparam-
eters of the proposed methods in detail. And we have tested that by fixing the random seed,
our method can produce consistent results with the same input on our machine, providing
good reproducibility.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.

26


---Page Break---
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We open-source the code on GitHub and give the Python environment re-
quirements, dataset preparation, running commands, etc. Following our instructions, the
experimental results given in the paper can be easily reproduced.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: One of the main contributions of our paper is to propose a novel adversarial
attack modeling framework based on a non-parametric diffusion process. Benefiting from
the proposed modeling approach, our attack method only needs two simple hyperparameters
to accurately control the entire attack process, without the need for complex training or
optimization processes in other paradigms.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Only Figure 5 reports a actual statistic numerical curve of a theoretical
upper bound in the actual execution process, which is calculated from actual data using a
confidence level of 0.85 and shows the confidence interval. In other experiments, due to
limited computing resources, the error bar under multiple runs is not included. However,
as mentioned above, the methods proposed in this paper can obtain consistent results in
multiple runs by fixing the random seed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have indicated that all the experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA
RTX 3090 GPU, and the running time required for all methods to attack different models are
included in Table 1, Table 5, and Table 8 to compare the computational complexity while
providing a reference.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We ensure that the research conducted in the paper complies with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics in all respects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: As a research on adversarial attacks of deep neural networks, the significance
lies in revealing possible attack algorithms and the vulnerabilities of the models in advance,
in order to help promote corresponding defense methods or the model robustness, and
improve the safety of deep neural networks in real-world applications.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

29


---Page Break---
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The dataset we used is under the MIT License, and it has been properly cited
in the paper with its URL.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

30


---Page Break---
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
