Abstract

State-of-the-art LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors usually focus on feature fusion.
1

However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion strategy. In
2

this work, we for the first time point out that different modalities play different roles
3

as depth varies via statistical analysis and visualization. Based on this finding, we
4

propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature Fusion (DH-Fusion) strategy that guides the
5

weights of point cloud and RGB image modalities by introducing depth encoding
6

at both global and local levels. Specifically, the Depth-Aware Global Feature
7

Fusion (DGF) module adaptively adjusts the weights of image Bird’s-Eye-View
8

(BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth encoding. Furthermore,
9

to compensate for the information lost when transferring raw features to the BEV
10

space, we propose a Depth-Aware Local Feature Fusion (DLF) module, which
11

adaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image
12

features in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive experiments
13

on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our DH-Fusion method surpasses previous
14

state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. NDS. Moreover, our DH-Fusion is more robust to
15

various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods on nuScenes-C w.r.t.
16

both NDS and mAP.

Introduction
18

3D object detection has a wide range of applications in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics.
19

A large number of previous works have successfully focused on using a single modality, such as point
20

cloud or images, to design efficient 3D object detectors. However, the performance of these detectors
21

reaches a bottleneck due to the limitations of modality characteristics. For instance, the point cloud
22

modality can only provide rich geometric information while lacks detailed semantic information;
23

the image modality can only provide rich texture information while lacks three-dimensional spatial
24

information. To address the aforementioned issues, we are highly motivated to obtain comprehensive
25

information that represents objects by designing a LiDAR-camera 3D object detector.
26

In recent years, LiDAR-camera 3D object detection develops rapidly. Some works [1, 4, 28, 33, 67]
27

propose effective methods to integrate information from two modalities at the feature level. However,
28

they all overlook an important factor of depth in their fusion strategies. To understand how point
29

cloud and image information vary with depth, we first conduct statistical and visualization analysis
30

on the nuScenes-mini dataset [3], and find that: (1) The number of points representing objects at
31

near range is relatively large, which allows us to accurately determine the object’s location, size, and
32

category, even without the aid of images. As shown in Fig. 1a, there is an average of 163.7 points per
33

object within 0-10 meters, which is a substantial number. We also visualize a car at 6.8 meters in
34

Fig. 1b ①and find it encompasses a considerable number of points, well representing the shape. In
35

contrast, some background noise in the image may interfere with detection (Fig. 1b ②). (2) As the

depth increases, the number of points representing objects decreases rapidly. As shown in Fig. 1a,
37

the number of points within 30-50 meters falls below one per object, meaning that many objects are
38

even not represented by any points, such as the object at 42.1 meters in Fig. 1b ③. In contrast, the
39

complete objects may still be observed on the image, as in Fig. 1b ④, where the image information
40

becomes more important. To address the above problems, we propose a feature fusion strategy that
41

adaptively adjusts the importance of the two modalities based on depth.
42

Specifically, we propose a novel method for multi-modal 3D object detection, namely Depth-Aware
43

Hybrid Feature Fusion (DH-Fusion). The innovation lies in adaptively adjusting the weights of
44

features by introducing depth encoding to hybrid feature fusion at both global and local levels. The
45

fusion strategy consists of two crucial components: Depth-Aware Global Feature Fusion (DGF)
46

module and Depth-Aware Local Feature Fusion (DLF) module. In DGF, we take point cloud Bird’s-
47

Eye-View (BEV) features and image BEV features as inputs, and dynamically adjust the weights of
48

image BEV features based on depth during fusion by utilizing a global-fusion transformer encoder
49

with a depth encoder. To compensate for the information lost when transforming raw features to
50

BEV space, we enhance the fused BEV features at a lower cost by utilizing the original instance
51

features. In DLF, we obtain 3D boxes by utilizing a Region Proposal Network (RPN). Then, the
52

3D boxes are projected into both LiDAR voxel features and multi-view image features to crop out
53

corresponding local instance features with more detailed information. Afterward, we take these as
54

inputs and dynamically adjust the weights of local multi-view image features and local LiDAR voxel
55

features based on depth through the use of a local-fusion transformer encoder with the depth encoder.
56

In the end, we update local features for each object on the global feature map to enhance the detailed
57

instance information of multi-modal global features for detection.
58

Our contributions are summarized as follows.
59

1. We for the first time point out that depth is an important factor to consider while fusing LiDAR
60

point cloud features and RGB image features for 3D object detection. From our statistical and
61

visualization analysis, we can see that image features play different roles as depth varies.
62

2. We propose a depth-aware hybrid feature fusion strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of
63

features during feature fusion by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels. The
64

above strategy can obtain high-quality features for detection, fully leveraging the advantages of
65

different modalities at various depths.
66

3. Our method is evaluated on the nuScenes [3] dataset and a more challenging nuScenes-C [13]
67

dataset, outperforming previous multi-modal methods and being robust to various kinds of data
68

corruptions.

Related Work
70

Since our method is based on conducting 3D object detection using data from multiple modalities,
71

including point cloud and images, we briefly review recent works in the following fields: LiDAR-
72

based 3D object detection, camera-based 3D object detection, and LiDAR-camera 3D object detection.
73

2.1
LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection
74

LiDAR-based 3D object detectors only take the point cloud as input. Based on their different data
75

representations, they can be divided into point-based [44–46, 64, 65], voxel-based [12, 22, 61, 68, 71],
76

and point-voxel-based [17, 42, 43] methods. The feature extraction networks of point-based methods
77

typically extract features directly from the point cloud through a point-based backbone [40], such as
78

PointRCNN [44]. The voxel-based methods first convert the point cloud into voxels and then extract
79

voxel features through a 3D sparse convolution network [14], such as VoxelNet [71]. Point-voxel-
80

based methods like PV-RCNN [42] combine the above two methods to extract and fuse point and
81

voxel features. The purpose of these approaches is to capture the geometric spatial information of the
82

point cloud. However, point cloud is sparse and incomplete, lacking detailed texture information,
83

which greatly limits the detection performance.
84

2.2
Camera-based 3D Object Detection
85

Camera-based 3D object detectors only take images as inputs. Depending on the form of inputs,
86

they can be divided into monocular [2, 24, 32, 41, 47, 55], stereo [6, 25, 30, 48, 70], and multi-view
87

[19, 27, 56, 62] 3D object detectors. Early works like FCOS3D [55] input a monocular image and
88

utilize 2D object detectors to directly predict 3D bounding boxes, but these approaches have limited
89

capability in capturing spatial information. Subsequently, stereo and multi-view 3D object detectors
90

are proposed to obtain more precise depth information by constructing spatial relationships among
91

multiple images, such as Stereo RCNN [25] and BEVDet [19]. These methods successfully achieve
92

purely visual 3D object detection, but they do not perform as well as LiDAR-based methods, because
93

the spatial depth information provided by images is not as direct and precise as that provided by point
94

cloud.
95

2.3
LiDAR-Camera 3D Object Detection
96

LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors take point cloud and images as inputs, and can be classified
97

into early-fusion-based [50, 52, 57, 59, 69], intermediate-fusion-based [1, 4, 28, 33, 67], and late-
98

fusion-based [37, 38] 3D object detectors based on the location of multi-modal information fusion
99

[36].
100

Early-fusion-based methods perform at the point level, where the typical approach involves enhancing
101

the raw point cloud with semantic information extracted from images. PointPainting [50] and Fu-
102

sionPainting [59] decorate the raw point cloud with semantic scores from 2D semantic segmentation.
103

Similarly, PointAugmenting [52] enhances the raw point cloud using features extracted from a 2D
104

semantic segmentation network. However, early-fusion-based methods are sensitive to alignment
105

errors between the two modalities.
106

Intermediate-fusion-based methods perform at the feature level. Transfusion [1] first proposes to
107

utilize the transformer for fine-grained fusion from LiDAR BEV features and multi-view image
108

features. FUTR3D [5] encode each modality using deformable attention [73] in its own coordinate
109

and concatenate them for fusion. BEVFusion [28, 33] projects both point cloud and images to BEV
110

space for BEV feature fusion. SparseFusion [58] extracts instance-level features from both two
111

modalities separately, and fuse them to perform detection. Similarly, ObjectFusion [4] utilizes 3D
112

proposals from LiDAR modality to extract instance-level features for fusion. CMT [60] proposes
113

the simultaneous interaction between the object queries and multi-modal features in the transformer
114

encoder and decoder. IS-Fusion [67] proposes feature fusion at both the instance level and scene
115

level. The intermediate-fusion-based methods gradually become a mainstream approach due to the
116

diversity of fusion strategies.
117

Late-fusion-based methods perform at the bounding box level. Typically, CLOCs [37] obtains 2D and
118

3D bounding boxes by separately using 2D and 3D object detectors, and then combine them to achieve
119

more accurate 3D bounding boxes. However, the interaction between modalities in late-fusion-based
120

methods is very limited, which constrains model performance.
121

These multi-modal methods successfully outperform single-modal methods. However, their feature
122

fusion methods do not take depth into account. In contrast, our approach introduces depth information
123

to guide the hybrid feature fusion, boosting the performance of the detector.

Methodology
125

In this section, we first give an overview of our proposed multi-modal 3D object detector, and then
126

provide a detailed introduction to our proposed feature fusion method.
127

3.1
Overview
128

We propose a multi-modal 3D object detection method via Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature Fusion
129

(DH-Fusion). As illustrated in Fig. 2, our approach consists of two important feature fusion modules:
130

Depth-Aware Global Feature Fusion (DGF) and Depth-Aware Local Feature Fusion (DLF). In the
131

following, we briefly describe the detection pipeline.
132

Inputs. First, we take the point cloud P and multi-view images I as inputs, where point cloud
133

consists of a set of points: P = {P1, P2, · · · , PNl}, and each point has four dimensions: X-axis,
134

Y-axis, Z-axis, and intensity; the multi-view images comprise Nc images: I = {I1, I2, · · · , INc},
135

each image captured by its corresponding camera.
136

Input Encoding. For the point cloud P, we use a 3D encoder to extract raw global voxel features
137

VG
O; for the multi-view images I, we use a 2D encoder to extract image features of all views IG
O.
138

Hybrid Feature Fusion. Then, for voxel features VG
O, we compress the height dimension to obtain
139

point cloud BEV features VG
B ; for image features IG
O, we transform their perspective view to bird’s
140

eye view to obtain image BEV features IG
B. To fully leverage the features from two modalities, we
141

design a DGF module that aims to dynamically adjust the weights of image BEV features based
142

on depth values during feature fusion. Please refer to Sec. 3.2 for more details. To compensate
143

for the information lost when transforming raw features to BEV space, we propose a DLF module
144

that, based on depth, utilizes the raw features to enhance the detailed information of each object
145

instance in global multi-modal features. It consists of three processes: local feature selection, local
146

feature fusion, and merging local features into global features. First, we obtain the local multi-modal
147

BEV features FL
B, local voxel features VL
O, and local multi-view image features IL
O, by cropping the
148

corresponding global features based on the 3D boxes obtained from an RPN; then, it dynamically
149

and individually adjusts the weights of each local feature of VL
O and IL
O based on depth values during
150

feature fusion; finally, we update local features for each object on the global feature map. Please
151

refer to Sec. 3.3 for more details. In this way, we obtain enhanced multi-modal global features for
152

detection.
153

Decoding. Based on the enhanced multi-modal global features ˆFG
B that contain rich semantic and
154

spatial information, we utilize a transformer decoder and a detection head to predict the object
155

categories and 3D bounding boxes.

3.2
Depth-Aware Global Feature Fusion
157

As shown in Fig. 3, the DGF module consists of a global-fusion transformer with a depth encoder. In
158

the following, we provide a detailed explanation of each component.
159

3.2.1
Depth Encoder
160

We introduce depth encoding (DE) in feature fusion to dynamically adjust the weights of image BEV
161

features during fusion. First, we build a depth matrix M to store the depth value of each position
162

element pk represented as:
163

pk = {(xk, yk) : dk}, k ∈[1, n],
(1)

where (xk, yk) are the positional coordinates, dk is the depth value, and n is the number of elements.
164

Then, we use Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between every element’s spatial location
165

(xk, yk) and the ego coordinate element’s location (x n

2 , y n

2 ):
166

dk = E((xk, yk), (x n

2 , y n

2 )), k ∈[1, n],
(2)

where we denote E(·) as the Euclidean distance calculation. The depth matrix M serves as a lookup
167

table to avoid redundant computation of depth values. Since the size of the BEV features is large and
168

the depth distribution is simple, to avoid introducing additional parameters, the depth encoding De is
169

obtained by applying sine and cosine functions [49] to the depth matrix.
170

3.2.2
Global-Fusion Transformer
171

In the global-fusion transformer, we take the point cloud BEV features VG
B ∈RW ×H×C and image
172

BEV features IG
B ∈RW ×H×C as inputs, and integrate the depth encoding obtained above by multi-
173

plying it with the point cloud BEV features, forming the query QG
V = N(VG
B × Conv(De)), where
174

Conv(·) is a convolution operation to align with the channels of VG
B, and N(·) is a normalization
175

layer. The image BEV features are queried as the corresponding key KG
I and value V G
I . We utilize
176

the multi-head cross attention to achieve the interacted feature ˆVG
B based on depth:
177

ˆVG
B = CA(QG
V , KG
I , V G
I ),
(3)

where CA(·) indicates the multi-head cross attention. Afterward, we aggregate the information from
178

both modalities to obtain the fused features FG
B :
179

FG
B = N(FFN(N(ˆVG
B + VG
B )) + N(ˆVG
B + VG
B )),
(4)

5


---Page Break---
where N(·) is a normalization layer; FFN(·) specifies a feed-forward network containing two
180

convolution operations. In this way, we obtain fused features in which the image features play
181

different roles as the depth varies.
182

3.3
Depth-Aware Local Feature Fusion
183

As shown in Fig. 4, the DLF module consists of a local feature selection and a local-fusion transformer
184

with the depth encoder. In the following, we provide a detailed explanation of each component.
185

3.3.1
Local Feature Selection
186

To compensate for the information lost when transforming point cloud features and image features to
187

BEV space, we enhance the instance details of fused BEV features FG
B using instance features from
188

raw voxel features VG
O and multi-view image features IG
O. Specifically, we utilize an RPN to regress
189

t 3D boxes based on the BEV features FG
B . We directly crop the global fused BEV features FG
B
190

based on the regressed 3D boxes to obtain the local fused BEV features FL
B ∈Rc×t. On the other
191

hand, we project the 3D boxes onto the raw voxel features and multi-view image features to obtain
192

their corresponding local features before global fusion, preserving richer information for each object
193

instance. Specifically, we utilize the voxel pooling operation [12], followed by a 3D convolution
194

operation and a linear layer, to extract local voxel features VL
O ∈Rc×t; we transform the 3D boxes
195

from bird’s eye view to perspective view, and utilize the RoI Align operation [15], followed by a
196

linear layer, to extract instance image features IL
O ∈Rc×t. By doing this, we obtain the hybrid
197

(before & after global fusion) local features, which will be sent to the subsequent fusion module.
198

3.3.2
Local-Fusion Transformer
199

In the local-fusion transformer, the weights of each local raw feature are dynamically adjusted based
200

on depth values during feature fusion, and we update local features for each object on the global
201

feature map. Specifically, we take the local multi-modal BEV features FL
B, local voxel features VL
O,
202

and local multi-view image features IL
O as inputs, and integrate the depth encoding by multiplying
203

it with the local multi-modal BEV features, forming the query QL
F. The local multi-view image
204

features and local voxel features are respectively queried as the corresponding key KL
I , KL
V and value
205

V L
I , V L
V . The two multi-head cross-attention modules are utilized to achieve the interacted features
206

ˆQL
F, ˆQL
F
′. Note that the computation process of multi-head cross attention is similar to that described
207

in Sec. 3.2.2 and is omitted here. Afterward, we aggregate the above features:
208

ˆFL
B = Conv(Cat( ˆQL
F + FL
B, ˆQL
F
′ + FL
B
′)),
(5)

where Cat(·) is the concatenation operation; Conv(·) is used to align with the feature channels of
209

global fused BEV features FG
B . As a result, we obtain enhanced local features by dynamically calling
210

back rich information in raw modalities at various depths. Afterward, we update the global features
211

FG
B by inserting the enhanced local features at corresponding locations.

Experiments
213

In this section, we will first introduce the dataset and evaluation metrics, followed by the implementa-
214

tion details. Then, we will compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes and
215

also present results on a more challenging dataset of nuScenes-C with data corruptions. Finally, we
216

will show the ablation studies and qualitative results. More experiments are provided in Appendix
217

A.2.

4.1
Experimental Setup
219

Datasets and evaluation metrics. We evaluate our proposed DH-Fusion on the nuScenes benchmark
220

[3] and a more challenging dataset of nuScenes-C [13] with data corruptions. nuScenes dataset
221

provides 700 scene sequences for training, 150 scene sequences for validation, and 150 scene
222

sequences for testing. Each sequence contains 40 frames of 32-beam LiDAR data, and each frame
223

---Page Break---
has six corresponding images covering a 360-degree field of view. It offers calibration matrices that
224

facilitate accurate projection of 3D points onto 2D pixels, and contains 10 object categories that are
225

commonly encountered within autonomous driving. nuScenes-C dataset provides 27 corruptions
226

with 5 severities on the nuScenes validation set, including corruptions at the weather, sensor, motion,
227

object, and alignment level. We use the nuScenes detection scores (NDS) and mean Average Precision
228

(mAP) to evaluate our detection results, where NDS is a comprehensive metric in nuScenes that
229

combines object translation, scale, orientation, velocity, and attribute errors.
230

Implementation details. We implement the proposed DH-Fusion with PyTorch [39] under the
231

open-source framework MMDetection3D [10]. Specifically, for the LiDAR branch, we use VoxelNet
232

[71] with FPN [61] as the 3D encoder. The voxel size is set to [0.075m, 0.075m, 0.1m], and the range
233

of point cloud is [-54m, 54m] along the X-axis, [-54m, 54m] along the Y-axis, and [-3m, 5m] along
234

the Z-axis. For the image branch, we use the ResNet18 [16], ResNet50 [16], and SwinTiny [34] with
235

FPN [29] as the 2D image encoder of DH-Fusion-light, -base, -large, respectively. Correspondingly,
236

the resolution of input images is resized to 256 × 704, 320 × 800, and 384 × 1056. Additionally, we
237

utilize BEVPoolV2 [18] to obtain image BEV features. Following [33], the feature size W × H is set
238

to 180 × 180, the channel C is set to 128, and the channel c is also set to 128. The multi-head cross
239

attention is implemented with 8 heads, and the FFN contains 2 MLP layers with a hidden dimension
240

of 128. Following [58], the number of regressed 3D boxes t is set to 200. More implementation
241

details are provided in Appendix A.1.
242

4.2
Comparison to the State of the Art
243

Aiming for a fair comparison, we categorize previous methods based on the types of 2D backbones
244

into ResNet50-based, SwinTiny-based, and others, and provide three versions of our proposed method,
245

named DH-Fusion-light, DH-Fusion-base, and DH-Fusion-large. The results are shown in Tab. 1.
246

(1) Compared with the ResNet50-based methods, our DH-Fusion-base outperforms the top method
247

FocalFormer3D [7] by up to 1 pp w.r.t. NDS under the same configuration. Specifically, we reach
248

74.0% w.r.t. NDS and 71.2% w.r.t. mAP on the validation set, and 74.7% w.r.t. NDS and 71.7%
249

w.r.t. mAP on the test set, while maintaining comparable inference speed of 8.7 FPS on a 3090 GPU.
250

(2) Compared with the SwinTiny-based methods and others, our DH-Fusion-large outperforms the
251

top method IS-Fusion [67] under the same configuration, and runs 2x faster than it. Specifically, we
252

reach 74.4% w.r.t. NDS on the validation set, and 75.4% w.r.t. NDS on the test set, while achieving a
253

faster inference speed of 5.7 FPS on a 3090 GPU, indicating that our proposed method is both more
254

effective and efficient. (3) Furthermore, our DH-Fusion-light surpasses the typical BEVFusion [33]
255

by up to 1 pp w.r.t. all metrics using a lighter 2D backbone, and achieves a real-time inference speed
256

of 13.8 FPS. Overall, our method achieves higher detection accuracy and faster inference speed.
257

Robustness to Corruptions
258

We further implement some experiments on the nuScenes-C [13] dataset to evaluate the model’s
259

robustness under various corruptions, including changes in weather, data loss or temporal-spatial
260

misalignment in multi-modal inputs, etc. The results for different kinds of corruptions are shown
261

in Tab. 2, and more detailed results for each fine-grained corruption are shown in Appendix A.2.3.
262

We find that our DH-Fusion-light still achieves an average performance of 68.67% w.r.t. NDS and
263

63.07% w.r.t. mAP under various corruptions, which only decreases by 4.63 pp w.r.t. NDS and
264

6.68 pp w.r.t. mAP, compared to its performance without corruptions. Performance drop is smaller
265

than that observed with previous methods including BEVFusion [28] across all kinds of corruptions,
266

indicating that our DH-Fusion-light possesses superior robustness. Furthermore, we observe that our
267

DH-Fusion-light is particularly robust against weather and object corruptions, where the performance
268

drop is less than 3pp. The more stable performance indicates that our method is more friendly to
269

practical applications, where data corruption may occur.
270

4.4
Ablation Studies
271

We conduct ablation studies to first demonstrate the effect of each component of DH-Fusion, then
272

to demonstrate the effect of depth encoding in DGF and DLF, and finally to assess the impact of
273

multiplying depth encoding. All method variants are implemented on the nuScenes validation dataset.

Effect of DGF and DLF. To demonstrate the effect of DGF and DLF, we conduct experiments by
275

integrating the components one by one into the baseline, BEVFusion [33]. The results are shown
276

in Tab. 3. We find that our DGF improves the baseline performance by 1.0 pp w.r.t. NDS and 0.9
277

pp w.r.t. mAP. This demonstrates that dynamically adjusting the weights of the image BEV features
278

during fusion is effective for 3D object detection. Additionally, our DLF improves the baseline
279

performance by 1.3 pp w.r.t. NDS and 0.8 pp w.r.t. mAP, which indicates that dynamically adjusting
280

the weights of the local raw instance features based on depth during fusion effectively compensates
281

for the information loss caused by the transformation of global features into the BEV feature space.
282

The results of integrating both components show an improvement of 1.9 pp w.r.t. NDS and 1.3 pp
283

w.r.t. mAP, well verifying the benefits of dynamically fusing global and local hybrid features based
284

on depth.
285

Effect of depth encoding in DGF and DLF. To evaluate the effectiveness of our depth encoding,
286

we conduct experiments where the depth encoding is removed from the DGF and DLF modules,
287

respectively. The results are shown in Tab. 4. When removing the depth encoding from Baseline+DGF,
288

the performance drops by 0.6 pp w.r.t. NDS and 0.4 pp w.r.t. mAP. Similarly, when removing the
289

depth encoding from Baseline+DLF, the performance also decreases by 1.1 pp w.r.t. NDS and 0.9 pp
290

w.r.t. mAP. These results indicate that our depth encoding is effective. Furthermore, we observe that
291

removing the depth encoding from the DLF module results in a larger performance drop, suggesting
292

that depth encoding plays a more crucial role in local feature fusion.
293

Impact of different operations for depth encoding. We conduct experiments with different
294

operations of depth encoding, including concatenation, summation, and multiplication. The results
295

in Tab. 5, show that the multiplication operation consistently outperforms the summation and
296

concatenation operations w.r.t. both metrics. The superior performance of multiplication can be
297

attributed to its ability to more effectively modulate the feature maps based on depth information.
298

Unlike summation, which simply shifts the feature values, or concatenation, which increases the
299

dimensionality without direct interaction, multiplication allows for more interaction between the
300

depth encoding and features, leading to better feature representation and ultimately improving the
301

detection performance.
302

4.5
Qualitative Results
303

To better understand how depth encoding affects the feature fusion, in Fig. 5, we plot a curve to
304

observe how the attention weights applied on the image BEV features in our DGF module vary with
305

depth, and visualize the average attention map. It is evident that the weights of the image BEV
306

features stay low in near range, but go up significantly as depth increases when the depth is larger
307

than 40 meters. This trend supports our hypothesis that the image modality would become more
308

important as depth increases. In this way, our depth encoding allows the model to dynamically adjust
309

the weights of image BEV features based on depth.
310

We also compare the detection results of our DH-Fusion method with the baseline BEVFusion [33]
311

in Fig. 6, where we clearly find that our method better localizes those distant objects compared to
312

BEVFusion. These results demonstrate that our proposed multi-modal fusion strategy based on depth
313

is more effective for detection. Besides, we exhibit the corresponding BEV feature maps, where
314

our method shows a stronger feature response for the foreground objects, especially for distant ones.
315

That is why our feature fusion strategy can provide higher-quality detection results. More qualitative
316

results can be found in Appendix A.3.
317

Conclusion
318

In this paper, we for the first time point out that different modalities play different roles as depth varies
319

via statistical analysis and visualization. Based on this finding, we propose a feature fusion strategy
320

for multi-modal 3D object detection, namely Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature Fusion (DH-Fusion), that
321

dynamically adjusts the weights of features during feature fusion by introducing depth encoding at
322

both global and local levels. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our
323

DH-Fusion method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. NDS. Moreover, our DH-Fusion
324

is more robust to various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods on the nuScenes-C
325

dataset w.r.t. both NDS and mAP. Our method uses an attention-based approach to interact with
326

the two modalities, making the detection results sensitive to modality loss. We plan to further
327

explore feature fusion methods that are robust to modality loss. Although our method improves
328

detection performance, emergency plans still need to be implemented in practical applications to
329

ensure personnel safety.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
481

1. Claims
482

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
483

paper’s contributions and scope?
484

Answer: [Yes]
485

Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
486

paper’s contributions and scope. The claims are clearly stated and are consistent with the
487

theoretical and experimental results presented in the paper.
488

Guidelines:
489

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
490

made in the paper.
491

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
492

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
493

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
494

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
495

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
496

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
497

are not attained by the paper.
498

2. Limitations
499

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
500

Answer: [Yes]
501

Justification: We discuss the limitations of our method, specifically that using an attention-
502

based approach to interact with the two modalities makes the detection results sensitive to
503

modality loss.
504

Guidelines:
505

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
506

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
507

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
508

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
509

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
510

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
511

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
512

implications would be.
513

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
514

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
515

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
516

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
517

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
518

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
519

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
520

technical jargon.
521

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
522

and how they scale with dataset size.
523

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
524

address problems of privacy and fairness.
525

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
526

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
527

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
528

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
529

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
530

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
531

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
532

14


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
533

a complete (and correct) proof?
534

Answer: [Yes]
535

Justification: We provide detailed theoretical statements and formulas along with their
536

descriptions in the paper.
537

Guidelines:
538

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
539

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
540

referenced.
541

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
542

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
543

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
544

proof sketch to provide intuition.
545

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
546

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
547

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
548

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
549

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
550

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
551

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
552

Answer: [Yes]
553

Justification: We provide a detailed experimental setup in the paper, and the training and
554

testing details are provided in the supplementary material to ensure the reproducibility of
555

our results.
556

Guidelines:
557

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
558

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
559

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
560

whether the code and data are provided or not.
561

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
562

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
563

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
564

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
565

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
566

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
567

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
568

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
569

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
570

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
571

appropriate to the research performed.
572

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
573

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
574

nature of the contribution. For example
575

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
576

to reproduce that algorithm.
577

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
578

the architecture clearly and fully.
579

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
580

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
581

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
582

the dataset).
583

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
584

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
585

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
586

15


---Page Break---
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
587

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
588

5. Open access to data and code
589

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
590

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
591

material?
592

Answer: [No]
593

Justification: We release the experimental details in the paper, and the code will be released
594

after the paper is accepted.
595

Guidelines:
596

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
597

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
598

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
599

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
600

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
601

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
602

benchmark).
603

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
604

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
605

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
606

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
607

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
608

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
609

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
610

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
611

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
612

versions (if applicable).
613

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
614

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
615

6. Experimental Setting/Details
616

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
617

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
618

results?
619

Answer: [Yes]
620

Justification: We provide a detailed experimental setup in the paper, and the training and
621

testing details are provided in the supplementary material.
622

Guidelines:
623

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
624

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
625

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
626

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
627

material.
628

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
629

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
630

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
631

Answer: [Yes]
632

Justification: We provide data explanations and statistical methods for obtaining statistical
633

results in the paper.
634

Guidelines:
635

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
636

16


---Page Break---
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
637

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
638

the main claims of the paper.
639

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
640

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
641

run with given experimental conditions).
642

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
643

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
644

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
645

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
646

of the mean.
647

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
648

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
649

of Normality of errors is not verified.
650

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
651

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
652

error rates).
653

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
654

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
655

8. Experiments Compute Resources
656

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
657

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
658

the experiments?
659

Answer: [Yes]
660

Justification: We provide hardware computer resources for training and testing.
661

Guidelines:
662

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
663

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
664

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
665

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
666

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
667

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
668

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
669

didn’t make it into the paper).
670

9. Code Of Ethics
671

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
672

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
673

Answer: [Yes]
674

Justification: The research conducted in our paper complies with NeurIPS ethical standards
675

in all aspects.
676

Guidelines:
677

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
678

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
679

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
680

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
681

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
682

10. Broader Impacts
683

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
684

societal impacts of the work performed?
685

Answer: [Yes]
686

Justification: We discuss that although our method has good performance, practical applica-
687

tions need to ensure personnel safety.
688

17


---Page Break---
Guidelines:
689

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
690

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
691

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
692

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
693

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
694

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
695

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
696

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
697

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
698

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
699

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
700

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
701

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
702

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
703

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
704

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
705

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
706

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
707

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
708

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
709

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
710

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
711

11. Safeguards
712

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
713

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
714

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
715

Answer: [NA]
716

Justification: The model of the paper dos not address the issues mentioned in the guidelines.
717

Guidelines:
718

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
719

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
720

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
721

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
722

safety filters.
723

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
724

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
725

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
726

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
727

faith effort.
728

12. Licenses for existing assets
729

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
730

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
731

properly respected?
732

Answer: [Yes]
733

Justification: We have annotated the cited papers and datasets in our paper.
734

Guidelines:
735

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
736

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
737

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
738

URL.
739

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
740

18


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
741

service of that source should be provided.
742

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
743

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
744

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
745

license of a dataset.
746

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
747

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
748

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
749

the asset’s creators.
750

13. New Assets
751

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
752

provided alongside the assets?
753

Answer: [NA]
754

Justification: The paper does not release new assets
755

Guidelines:
756

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
757

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
758

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
759

limitations, etc.
760

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
761

asset is used.
762

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
763

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
764

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
765

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
766

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
767

well as details about compensation (if any)?
768

Answer: [NA]
769

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
770

Guidelines:
771

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
772

human subjects.
773

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
774

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
775

included in the main paper.
776

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
777

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
778

collector.
779

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
780

Subjects
781

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
782

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
783

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
784

institution) were obtained?
785

Answer: [NA]
786

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
787

Guidelines:
788

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
789

human subjects.
790

19


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
791

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
792

should clearly state this in the paper.
793

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
794

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
795

guidelines for their institution.
796

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
797

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

total of 20 epochs with the AdamW optimizer [35] loading from the pre-trained weights from the
802

ImageNet [11] classification task only. Meanwhile, we use CBGS [72] to resample the training data,
803

and the one-cycle learning policy with a maximum learning rate of 2.0 × 10−4. The batch size is set
804

to 8 on 4 3090 RTX GPUs. We adopt random flipping along both X and Y-axis, the random scaling in
805

[0.95, 1.05], and random rotation in [-π/8, π/8] to augment the LiDAR data, and the random rotation
806

in [-5.4◦, 5.4◦] and random resizing in [-0.06, 0.44] to augment the images. During evaluation, we
807

test a single model without any data augmentation on a single 3090 RTX GPU.

Additional Experiments

A.2.1
3D Multi-Object Tracking Experiments
810

We evaluate our DH-Fusion on the nuScenes tracking benchmark for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT)
811

task. Following ObjectFusion [4], we adopt the same tracking-by-detection algorithm that uses
812

velocity-based closest point distance matching, which is more effective than 3D Kalman filter [9].
813

For fair comparisons, we report the results of our DH-Fusion-light capable of real-time detection
814

on the nuScenes validation set, as shown in Tab. 6. We find that our DH-Fusion-light outperforms
815

BEVFusion [33] and ObjectFusion [4] by 2.0 pp and 0.6 pp w.r.t. AMOTA. These results demonstrate
816

that our DH-Fusion provides 3D detection boxes of higher quality, benefiting the downstream task of
817

3D MOT.

A.2.2
Evaluation at Different Depths
819

Since our fusion strategy is depth-aware, it is necessary to validate our method at different depths.
820

Following [4], we categorize annotation and prediction ego distances into three groups: Near (0-
821

20m), Middle (20-30m), and Far (>30m). As shown in Tab. 7, compared to ObjectFusion [4], our
822

DH-Fusion-light consistently improves performance across all depth ranges. Specifically, our method
823

achieves a 47.1 mAP in the long range (>30m), surpassing ObjectFusion by 5.5 pp w.r.t. mAP. These
824

results indicate that our method is more effective across different depths, especially in detecting
825

distant objects.

Detailed Results on the nuScenes-C
827

We further provide the detailed results of each fine-grained corruption on nuScenes-C in Tab. 8. The
828

results are highly consistent with the average values of each kind of data corruption.
829

More Visualization
830

As an extension of Fig. 6 in the manuscript, we provide additional examples of 3D object detection
831

results and BEV features from our baseline, BEVFusion [33], and our DH-Fusion. In various
832

samples, our method consistently achieves higher accuracy and recall in 3D detection results, with
833

stronger feature responses for distant objects compared to BEVFusion. These results demonstrate the
834

effectiveness of the proposed method in dynamically adjusting the weights of features based on depth
835

during fusion at both global and local levels.

Table 8: Comparisons for each corruption level on the nuScenes-C. Corruptions exist in both
modalities by default. (L) means that only the point cloud modality has corruptions, and (C) means
that only the image modality has corruptions. Numbers are NDS / mAP.
