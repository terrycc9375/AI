ment of materials using graphic software is a tedious and time-consuming task.

Introduction

High-quality materials are important for the nuanced inclusion of view-dependent and lighting-
dependent effects in 3D assets for traditional graphics pipelines, critical for achieving realism
in gaming, online product showcasing, and virtual/augmented reality. However, many existing
assets and generated objects often lack realistic material properties, limiting their application in
downstream tasks. Furthermore, creating hand-designed realistic textures necessitates specialized
graphic software and involves a laborious and time-consuming process, compounded by significant
creative challenges [32].

Traditional computer graphics methods have been either manually creating materials or reconstructing
them from physical measurements. Emerging text-to-3D generative models [7, 34, 55, 10, 73, 50, 19,
51] and image-to-3D generative models [69, 58, 25, 63, 22, 62] are successful in creating complex
geometries and detailed appearances, but they struggle to generate physically realistic materials,
hampering their practical applicability. Recent studies have also explored advanced aspects of
appearance generation [11, 75, 70, 8, 40]. However, they often rely on simplified material models.
For instance, [40] lacks the ability to produce metallic maps. All these approaches do not generate
corresponding displacement and height maps, which restricts the diversity and realism of the generated
materials, especially regarding depth and tactile qualities. Furthermore, these methods typically
require relatively long training and inference time. Considering the abundance of high-quality
3D assets online [16, 17] that lack material attributes, and the maturity of 3D generative models
in geometry and albedo modeling, we aim to recover materials from high-quality geometry and
base-colored 3D meshes.

However, extracting and recovering material representations for 3D meshes is challenging. Unlike
previous material recognition methods [40, 4, 20], this difficulty is heightened when identifying and
separating different material regions within 3D objects in constricted albedo textures. These maps
only reflect the base color and can be distorted, as shown by the globe in the upper right corner of
Figure 1. Additionally, shadows and lighting can affect judgment. Thus, the model must have strong
material recognition capabilities and prior knowledge of object types and materials.

The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [5, 46, 12, 2, 23, 59] provides novel
approaches to problem-solving. These models have powerful visual understanding and recognition
capabilities, along with a vast repository of prior knowledge, which covers the task of material
estimation. Specifically, we are using GPT-4V(ision) for matching of materials. We first create highly
detailed descriptions for materials to build a comprehensive library. Next, we use GPT-4V to retrieve
materials for each segmented part of the object, utilizing visual prompts [72] and hierarchical text
prompts. Finally, we meticulously designed algorithms to generate SVBRDF maps with consistent
albedo, achieving realistic visual quality.

Notably, our work differs from the aforementioned studies by leveraging prior knowledge from
foundation models like GPT-4V to extract and infer materials in albedo-only constrained scenarios.
Additionally, we utilize existing material libraries as references to generate corresponding SVBRDF
maps on a designed region-to-pixel algorithm. As illustrated in Figure 1, our approach features: 1)
Enhanced 3D mesh realism: Leveraging GPT-4V’s visual perception and external knowledge, our
method improves the realism, depth, and visual quality of a wide range of mature 3D content genera-
tion models. 2) Part-specific material matching: Ensuring material consistency with a segmentation
network and refinement process, enabling precise material property retrieval for each segment. 3)
Rendering engine compatibility: Generating six comprehensive material maps(roughness, metallic,
specular, normal, displacement, height), which are compatible with downstream rendering engines.
Developers only need to paint albedo textures; material properties are then automatically generated,
saving extensive time on detailed ambient occlusion masks and material map creation.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

• We present the first exploration of leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
e.g.,GPT-4V for material recognition and unleashing their potential in applying real-world
materials to extensive 3D objects with albedo-only.

• We create a material library containing thousands of materials with highly detailed descrip-
tions readily for MLLMs to look up and assign.

maps generation, enabling the high-quality application of materials to 3D assets.

Related Work

3D Object Generation. The generation of 3D models using deep learning methods has experienced
rapid development in recent times. The mainstream research can be primarily divided into two
categories. The first category relies on techniques that optimize a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [43]
or 3D Gaussian [30] guided by 2D diffusion model through score-distillation-sampling(SDS) loss [48,
42, 39, 8, 64, 53, 56, 67]. The second category aims at obtaining 3D representation via direct
inference model, e.g.„ Point-E [44], Shap-E [28], and LRM [25], proven fast with high quality
through large-scale pretraining [24, 22, 57, 35, 55, 71, 58, 63, 65]. Although the capabilities of
these methods are continuously improving, they still lack a high degree of realism in textures. More
importantly, since the textures of 3D objects obtained by these methods are shaded, they cannot
directly respond to lighting changes under different lighting conditions, leading to less realism.
Although some works attempt to generate PBR textures, their results are considerably limited to
generate physically realistic materials due to the low robustness of SDS [75, 8]. Our work is the
first to introduce the prior knowledge of MLLMs into the texture synthesis process. We verifies
that our method can be seamlessly and effectively applied to generated 3D objects, facilitating their
downstream applications under different lighting condition.

Material Capture and Generation. Recent studies such as Material Palette [40], MatSim [20],
TwoshotBRDF [4] have made progress in the recognition and extraction of 3D object materials,
allowing for the retrieval of SVBRDF information from images of real materials [40] and combining
object shape and illumination [4], but they fail to extract and infer the materials of 3D objects with only
albedo. On the other hand, works like Paint-it [75], Matlaber [70], Collaborative [60], Fantasia3D [8],
and TANGO [11] focus on generating text-controllable 3D meshes with physically-based rendering
material properties. However, these methods require either extensive training time on BRDF datasets
or long inference time for generating materials. Additionally, they are limited to synthesizing only a
subset of PBR textures and cannot generate the full range of material properties, such as height and
displacement, which are essential for the fine tactile perception of object surfaces.

Multimodal Large Language Models. In the wake of the advancements achieved by large language
models (LLMs) [5, 46, 12, 2, 23, 59], domain of research has increasingly turned its attention towards
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent advances in this field focus on the integration
of vision understanding capabilities with LLMs [76, 1, 37, 36, 26, 21, 3, 18, 54, 49, 6].The advent
of GPT-4V [45] has marked a significant milestone in the evolution of MLLMs, demonstrating
groundbreaking 2D comprehending capabilities and open-world knowledge. Although GPT-4V
cannot directly process 3D data, a pioneering work , GPTEval3D [68], first exploited GPT-4V’s
ability in evaluating the quality of generated 3D objects, and found that GPT-4V’s judgement was in
line with human evaluation. In this work, we delve into a new application of GPT-4V for material
assignment of 3D objects.

Given the advancements in generating high-quality 3D shapes with albedo maps, the restoration of
realistic material properties remains a challenge. We highlight a novel problem: given a 3D mesh ( ˜O)
and known Albedo ( ˜A) map, which reflect the object’s intrinsic appearance, the goal is to extract and
restore all other SVBRDF attributes of the object, i.e. Make-it-Real( ˜O, ˜A) = {R, M, N, S, H, D}.
Our setup supports the popular Cook-Torrance analytical BRDF model [13]. In this parameterization,
the BRDF includes components for albedo ba ∈R3, metallic bm ∈R, and roughness br ∈R. For
more complex surface simulations, such as displacement and height modeling, we use the Blender
rendering engine to simulate the BRDF function fr(ωo, ωi; x).

3.2
Make-it-Real: A Framework for Material Matching and Generataion

In this section, we outline our material matching and generation pipeline, illustrated in Figure 2,
which encompasses three stages: rendering and segmenting 3D meshes, retrieving matching materials
using MLLM, and generating spatially varying BRDF maps from coarse to fine.

3.2.1
Rendering and Material Segmentation

To accurately segment different material regions on 3D meshes with albedo maps, we propose an
innovative segmentation strategy based on 2D image rendering in Figure 2 (a). Initially, we use
rasterization to render the input albedo mesh from various viewpoints to obtain a series of images:

I(x, y) = R

UVmap

rasterize( ˜O, vt, x, y)

, T

.
(2)

where I(x, y) is the pixel value at image coordinates (x, y), rasterize( ˜O, vt, ·) maps the 3D mesh
˜O from viewpoint vt to 2D screen coordinates, UVmap(·) converts rasterized coordinates to UV
coordinates, T is the albedo map, and R(·, T ) samples color from the T using the UV coordinates.

For the rendered images, we employ the Semantic-SAM [33] to perform preliminary semantic
segmentation. Empirically, we select the main viewpoint with the largest projected area of the
mesh, as it is more likely to contain more details. To address potential over-segmentation, drawing
inspiration from [74], we extract non-overlapping segments from the masks to form distinct patches,

as detailed in our approach in Figure 4 (a). These patches are then merged based on similar colors to
obtain the final material grouping. We incorporate Set-of-Mark [72] method to annotate each material
segment with a unique identifier, sorted by area size from largest to smallest. This annotation acts as
a visual cue, enhancing the visual comprehension capabilities of large multimodal language models.

3.2.2
MLLM-based Material Retrieval

Material library with fine-grained annotations.
To enable large multimodal language models to
accurately retrieve and match materials, we construct a finely annotated material library, as shown
in Figure 3. It is composed of three main components: comprehensive PBR texture maps, highly-
detailed records, and a category tree. It comprises 1,400 unique, tileable materials spanning 13 primary
categories and 80 subtypes. The data primarily derives from the [61], which offers comprehensive
PBR material textures under a CC0 license with 4K resolution. Each material is represented by seven
maps: albedo, roughness, metallic, specular, normal, displacement and height. Accompanying each
material are highly-detailed annotations by GPT-4V, offering thorough descriptions of the material’s
visual characteristics and rich semantic information for the subsequent retrieval process. Created
by crawling material sphere images and constructing prompts, these annotations capture subtle
differences between materials, facilitating precise retrieval by GPT-4V, as detailed in Appendix B.4.

Hierarchical prompting for material retrieval.
Due to the vast size of our material library, feeding
all prompts to GPT-4V simultaneously proves inefficient and challenging for memory retention. To
ensure efficient and accurate material allocation in segmented areas of 3D meshes, we adopt a
hierarchical text prompting approach. The schematic of the designed prompt is shown on the left
side of Figure 3, and a complete querying process unfolds in Appendix B.4. This method starts
by identifying the primary material types corresponding to each labeled region. Subsequently,
hierarchical prompts guide GPT-4V to distinguish specific subclasses within the main material
categories. We retrieve all descriptions under these subclasses to ascertain the most fitting descriptions
for the segmented blocks. This hierarchical processing enables a more granular search of our material
library, identifying the optimal description for each material segment. This approach aids in assigning
the most suitable materials to each region and reduces memory and time consumption.

3.2.3
SVBRDF Maps Generation

We propose a method to generate SVBRDF maps on a region-to-pixel scale in Figure 2 (c). Initially,
we segment texture map in uv space based on queried material regions on 2D image space. We then
estimate BRDF values in pixel space using the object’s original albedo map for reference, ensuring
consistency with the albedo map. This approach effectively enhances the realism of rendered surfaces.

Region-level texture map partitioning.
Upon acquiring segmentation masks for material regions
within the 2D rendered space of a 3D mesh, our objective transitions to transposing these segmen-
tations from the 2D image space to the corresponding UV space. As described in Section 3.2.1,we
extract 2D image features from 3D mesh points via rasterization, and then we apply the material
masks to these features, facilitating the accurate transfer of segmentation to UV space. To project the
image feature It back to the texture atlas Tt with segmented image mask mt at the viewpoint vt, we
apply gradient-based optimization for Lt over the values of Tt when rendered through the differential
renderer R, as presented in Equation (3). In Equation (4), we then compute the difference between
T mask
t
and the initialized Tt to transfer the mask image feature mt into the texture space, represented
by muv. The term σ denotes the difference coefficient. Due to the limited perspectives available in
rendering, we avoid using a naive median-filling approach to ensure that there are no missing areas
on the texture map. Instead, we employ a block-centric clustering based on albedo, as illustrated in
Figure 4 (b), to obtain cohesive and refined region masks. The process is shown in Appendix B.1

Pixel-level albedo-referenced estimation.
To achieve precise estimation of spatially varying BRDF
(SVBRDF) at the pixel level, we draw inspiration from techniques commonly utilized by artists in
creating texture maps. Artists typically use albedo maps as a reference for constructing ambient
occlusion masks and further generating SVBRDF maps for material properties, which occupies a
significant time portion of appearance modeling. Our method involves using the albedo map of the
original object as a reference to refine the retrieved materials. We enhance the querying process using
a KD-Tree algorithm, which searches for the nearest neighbor pixel index in the key albedo(retrieved
map) for each RGB value of the queried albedo(input map) pixel, detailed in Appendix B.2. This
process ensures that areas with similar colors exhibit similar BRDF values, avoiding abrupt changes

Experiments

4.1
Experiment settings

To verify the effectiveness of Make-it-Real, we conduct refinement experiments mainly on two types
of objects. The first type is artificial 3D assets, with the primary model from Objaverse [15] filtered by
[55]; The second type is objects generated by state-of-the-art 3D generation methods. For existing 3D
assets, we pick 200 objects with diverse textures from Objaverse by human experts. For 3D generative
models (InstantMesh [69], TripoSR [58], MVDream [53], Instant3D [34] and Fantasia3D [8]), we
also generate 200 objects for each methods use prompts designed in GPTEval3D [68]. We use
Make-it-Real to refine the objects and compare the texture quality before and after refinement. We
perform both GPT-4V [45] based evaluation and user study on the above objects (Detailed guidence
and prompts for evaluation are available in Appendix B.5).

In addition to evaluation details, we also provide information about the rendering procedure in
Appendix B.3 for reproducibility. This includes the rendering tools used in the experiments, hyper
parameters related to back-projection, and the basic performance metrics of the model during the
experiments, such as time, memory, and number of queries.

Experiment results

Texture refinement for existing 3D assets. As shown in Figure 5, assets processed through Make-
it-Real demonstrate the capability to accurately segment objects, assign various suitable materials,
and synthesize high-fidelity, photorealistic textures. Some materials exhibit notable highlights, such
as a marble bathtub and a globe made of gold. The interaction of these different materials with light
varies significantly, leading to diverse reflective effects under the same environmental lighting, thus
presenting a range of textures. Additionally, material properties vary across different regions; for
instance, the globe’s landmass and handle exhibit gold characteristics, while other parts are identified

as plastic. Furthermore, the texture and appearance of materials also vary, such as the subtle wrinkles
on the red box in the second column and the more pronounced color contrast at the base of the blue
box, which enhances realism and reflects signs of use. Due to the albedo-referenced algorithm design
in Section 3.2.3, regions with similar colors have similar BRDF values, avoiding abrupt changes in
material properties, such as the continuous gold surface of the globe and the silver body of the kettle.
Regions with significant color differences display consistent differential distributions with the key
map, such as the embossed textures on the lower left corner of the water bottle in Figure 5 and the
subtle particle variations on the surface of the red oil drum. Additionally, visualization of texture
maps demonstrates reasonably consistent textures with albedo, shown in Figure 6. Quantitive results
are shown in Table 1, and more qualitative results can be found in Appendix E.

Texture refinement for generated 3D objects. Figure 7 displays the qualitative results. By leveraging
our model for enhancement, we observe that Make-it-Real successfully generates appropriate material
maps for both image-to-3D and text-to-3D models.

Similarly, our Make-it-Real successfully paint these models with materials. As reported in Table 1,
human experts consistently favor the objects post-refinement across all evaluated 3D content creation
methods. This preference aligns with the evaluations performed by GPT-4V, indicating a general
consensus on the enhancement in quality achieved through Make-it-Real refinement process.

Ablation Study

Effects of mask refinement module. In Section 3.2.1, we performed additional material post-
processing on the segmentation outcomes, as depicted in Figure 8. The refined results in the last row
indicate that our module achieves precise material segmentation for most standard objects, thereby
enabling more accurate queries by GPT-4V. In Section 3.2.3, we addressed the completion of missing
regions in the texture map within the UV space at the regional level, as illustrated in Figure 9. This
method not only increases texture coverage but also enhances the visual quality and consistency of
the refined 3D model. More ablation studies can be found in Appendix D.

Effects of different texture maps. We validate the impact of various texture maps generated by
Make-it-Real on the appearance of 3D objects, as illustrated in Figure 16 of Appendix D.1. We
provide a detailed qualitative analysis of how different maps enhance the visual texture of materials.
For example, increasing metallic results in dampening of the base albedo and increasing in the shine
on the surface, while reducing roughness gives the surface a smoother appearance and enhances
highlights. Meanwhile, displacement and height maps contribute to the fine-grained bump details on
the object’s surface.

Effects of different UV mappings. Since UV mapping is a crucial step in the 2D-3D alignment tech-
nique of our method, we conduct experiments to assess how its quality impacts model performance.
The results, shown in Appendix D.2 and in the second column of Figure 17, indicate that UV map-
pings with excessive fragmentation and color entanglement can cause issues. However, our method
still performs well with artist-created UV mappings and Blender’s built-in mapping techniques. This
indicates our method still demonstrates good robustness with many mapping techniques.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel framework leveraging MLLMs prior of the world to build a material
library and proposing an automatic pipeline to refine and synthesize new PBR maps for initial 3D
models, achieving highly photo-realistic PBR textures maps synthesis. Experimental results confirm
that our approach can automatically refine both generated and CAD models to achieve photo-realism
under dynamic lighting conditions. We believe Make-it-Real is a new and promising solution in the
last few procedures of AI based 3D content creation pipeline with the development of MLLMs like
GPT-4V [45] as well as the roaring field of deep learning based 3D generation from scratch.

Appendix Overview

In this appendix, we provide additional details and results that are not included in the main paper
due to the space limit. The attached video includes intuitive and interesting qualitative results of
Make-it-Real.

B
Details of Make-it-Real

In this section, we detail the pipeline that briefly outlined in the main paper. We commence by
elaborating on the generation of SVBRDF Maps, incorporating illustrative figures to detail the
process involving operations in computer graphics. Appendix B.1 is dedicated to explaining the
acquisition of region-level texture map partition. Following that, in Appendix B.2 we discuss the
method of pixel-level albedo-referenced estimation. Then, in Appendix B.3 we declare some details
of rendering procedure. Appendix B.4 details the prompt design for material captioning and matching.
Appendix B.5 reports the details of the GPT-4V based evaluation.

B.1
Texture Partition Module Design

As illustrated in Figure 10, our process initiates with the rendering of a 3D object incorporating
the original albedo (i.e. query albedo) from multiple perspectives. Following this rendering phase,
we employ GPT-4V alongside a segmentor to derive segmented masks for the materials associated
with each viewpoint. The subsequent step involves the extraction of regions masked in these images
and their back-projection onto the mesh of the object. By examining the object from all acquired
viewpoints and applying UV unwrapping techniques, we achieve preliminary segmentation of all
materials. Subsequently, each material’s segment is refined using a albedo-based mask refinement
operation. Ultimately, by combining the segments of all materials, we obtain a region-level texture
partition map, which serves to guide our subsequent, more detailed operations.

B.2
Albedo-referenced Module Design

As illustrated in Figure 11, we developed a pixel-level albedo-referenced estimation module, building
upon the foundations laid out in Appendix B.1. This module is inspired by a technique frequently
employed by 3D artists, who often utilize albedo maps as a reference to generate images of other

Albedo RGB KD-Tree

maps by referencing albedo maps, employing KD-Tree algorithm for efficient nearest neighbor
searches, and normalizing colors via histogram equalization.

material properties. Accordingly, we designate the known albedo map as the query albedo, and the
albedo corresponding to the region of interest in the material as the key albedo.

The process to precisely obtain the final SVBRDF maps is divided into four steps: 1) Initially, to
address potential gaps in color intensity between the two albedo maps, histogram equalization is
employed to achieve a more uniform color distribution across the image. 2) Subsequently, for each
pixel on the query albedo—termed a reference pixel—we seek the most similar neighboring color
index on the key albedo. Given the high dimensionality of both maps (typically 1024x1024 pixels), a
brute-force approach to this search would be computationally prohibitive. To this end, we accelerate
the pixel query process using a KD-Tree algorithm, which organizes the RGB values of the key map’s
albedo into a KD-Tree for efficient nearest neighbor searches, reducing the computation time to under
ten seconds. 3) The third step involves using the obtained indices to obtain corresponding values from
the rest of the material maps. 4) Finally, by aggregating the query results for all material segments,
we are able to generate the comprehensive spatially variant SVBRDF maps.

Rendering Procedure Details

In the context of computer graphics, “albedo” typically denotes the primary color of a material, a
concept analogous to “base color” and “diffuse” in Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) paradigms,
both representing the inherent color of the material under uniformly scattered illumination.

In accordance with workflow requirements, the inclusion of height maps, displacement maps, specular
maps, and combinations of additional maps is optional. For objects demanding high surface details,
such as the oil barrel in Figure 5 and the stone horse in Figure 16, displacement or height maps
are incorporated and rendered using the mature 3D computer graphics software Blender engine.
Regarding 2D-3D alignment techniques, including rasterization rendering, back-projection, and UV
unwrapping detailed in Section 3.2.1, we adhere to the methodologies outlined in [51]. Specifically,

we utilize the Kaolin package (Kaolin [27]) and back-projection with masks [51], with the model
learning rate set to 0.02 in Equation (3) and the difference coefficient σ set to 0.1 in Equation (4).

This approach facilitates the systematic generation of various material texture maps in the presence of
only an albedo map, thereby ensuring consistency and realism within the Physically Based Rendering
(PBR) workflow. Moreover, the flexible application of different map types and 2D-3D alignment
techniques significantly enhances the detail and realism of rendered objects, effectively meeting the
demands of diverse rendering scenarios.

We evaluate the basic performance of the model by testing on a subset of 70 objects. Specifically, we
measure the average runtime, the number of material parts per object, the number of GPT-4 queries
per object, and GPU memory usage, as shown in Table 2. Additionally, we provide a detailed time
consumption analysis for each step, presented in Table 3.

Assuming you are an expert in determining whether the textures of 3D models meet Photorealistic 
standards (mainly focus on the quality of texture), we have generated some 3D objects using two 
different methods. These objects have the same shape but different textures. Above are the four-view 
images of a model generated by the two methods (the upper half is the four views of the object 
generated by method one, and the lower half is the four views of the object generated by method two). 
Please help me evaluate which of the two objects is more Photorealistic in terms of texture. Respond 
with 1 if you think the upper half object is more realistic. Respond with 2 if you think the lower half 
object is more realistic. Also tell me the reason in a new paragraph.

Based on the provided images, my evaluation would favor object 2 (the lower half object) as 
being more photorealistic in terms of texture.

The textures on object 2 have a more complex and nuanced appearance. The material of the 
uniform exhibits subtle variations in reflectivity and surface detail that suggest a more 
realistic fabric texture.  Additionally, the skin texture appears more lifelike with variations 
in tone and reflectivity that are characteristic of human skin. The metal police badges on 
object 2 has a more nuanced reflection, which suggests a more realistic interaction with 
environmental light. In contrast, the textures on object 1, while still detailed, lack the same 
level of subtlety and variation. The uniform looks somewhat flat and less fabric-like, and the 
overall surface details are less convincing as natural variations.

Figure 14: GPT-4V based evaluation prompts. We define a prompt for GPT-4V to generate human-
aligned comparison over objects before and after our texture refinement.

Material captioning. Due to limit context length for image tokens, it is currently impossible for
MLLMs to directly memories thousands of images of material balls. To address this, we use GPT-
4V to generate detailed captions for each material ball. As demonstrated in Figure 12, we input
concatenated images of material ball from same subcategory with prompt specifically tailored to
highlight texture properties. This strategy guides GPT-4V to generate detailed caption for each
material ball, distinguishing the subtle differences between them. These detailed captions are then
registered into material library.

Material matching. The MLLM-based material query process is exemplified through a simplified
case, as illustrated in Figure 13. Initially, GPT-4V is queried to identify the basic material for
matching. Following this preliminary matching, GPT-4V is queried for more specific materials using
the names of subcategories as filters, which narrows down the selection to a few candidates within the
same subcategory. For final material selection, GPT-4V is prompted with detailed captions from the
library, directing it to allocate the most suitable material. This is accomplished in conjunction with a
meticulously engineered segmentation process in UV space, ultimately facilitating MLLM-based
material matching. It is noteworthy that prompting GPT-4V to navigate through a three-level tree
structure has been proven to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of the matching process, as
opposed to directly selecting from thousands of materials directly.

B.5
Evaluation Details of Quantitative Results

Evaluation details. For the purpose of evaluating objects pre- and post-refinement, we render four
view images of each object and concatenate them vertically to facilitate a comprehensive assessment.
We craft a specific prompt to guide GPT-4V in conducting an impartial comparison of the texture
quality between two objects. As demonstrated in Figure 14. GPT-4V’s advanced capabilities enable
it to differentiate between the two objects, providing comparison results that closely align with
assessments made by human experts. In the scenario evaluated, GPT-4V successfully identifies all
enhancements (metal badges, human skin, and fabric textures).

Our overall pipeline presents a more challenging task, where the input is a rendered image with only
albedo information, and the output consists of textures for the entire object.

For human evaluators, we engage 16 volunteers with strong backgrounds in computer science, specif-
ically in 3D modeling and generation. To ensure unbiased evaluations, we maintain gender balance
through random selection. The assessment focuses on determining object material photorealism, as
shown in Figure 14. Volunteers train on 40 Objaverse cases, with and without materials, to enhance
their realism judgment for accurate test data evaluation.

Additional Related Works

In the context of extracting real-world materials from single images, the methodologies most closely
related to our work are Material Palette [40] and Photoshape [47]. Material Palette enables the
extraction of materials at the region level from a single image, generating tilable texture maps for
corresponding areas. Photoshape, on the other hand, automates the assignment of real materials to
different parts of a 3D shape by training a material classification network. However, this approach
needs the training of a material classifier, which is constrained to a limited set of object categories
(e.g., chairs) and material types. Besides, both methods require rendered images of objects with real
materials as input.

Our problem setting poses a more challenging task, as illustrated in Figure 15, which involves
identifying and recovering the original material properties from images of objects that only have a
albedo map, in addition to generating different material maps for the entire object. Humans have
the capacity to intuitively infer the underlying material properties of 3D objects from single images
containing only shape and basic colors. This capability is attributed to our robust material recognition
abilities and comprehensive prior knowledge of object categories, colors, and material attributes.
Building on this concept, our approach harnesses the potent image recognition capabilities and prior
knowledge inherent in large-scale multimodal language models to efficiently execute region-level
material extraction and identification, which is further enhanced by subsequent 2D-3D alignment
and albedo-referenced techniques to generate and apply material texture maps for physically realistic
rendering of 3D objects. Furthermore, [40] extracts the material takes 3 to 4 minutes, and process
an image containing three materials takes more than 10 minutes. In contrast, our method takes only
about 1 to 2 minutes to match and generate all the materials.

In more recent work, both MaPa [77] and our paper aim to enhance 3D objects with materials, but the
key difference lies in material retrieval methods. MaPa [77] relies on CLIP, while we use MLLM, a
distinction that we believe significantly boosts retrieval effectiveness for these reasons: 1) Enhanced
Global Context: CLIP focuses on one area at a time, requiring other parts to be masked, which
limits global semantic information. MLLM, however, retains this context by simply highlighting
the relevant area. 2) Hierarchical Material Dictionary: We introduce a hierarchical dictionary in
MLLM, providing descriptions and images of material spheres, enabling access to a more extensive
library of 1,394 materials compared to MaPa’s 118. 3) Advanced Explainability: With MLLM’s
rapid development, transitioning from CLIP to a multi-step hierarchical inference process with LLM
offers improved performance and clearer decision-making.

Additional Experiments

D.1
Effects of Different Texture Maps

We validate the impact of various texture maps generated by Make-it-Real on the appearance of
3D objects, as illustrated in Figure 16. For each example, the first column lacks the corresponding
map enhanced by Make-it-Real, while the second column includes the same conditions with the
specific material map. Initially, we compare the effect of metalness on object appearance. We observe
that the objects on the right, with a higher metalness map value, exhibit higher reflectivity, and the
reflected light’s color is similar to the material’s own color, closely resembling real-world objects and
appearing more aesthetically pleasing. In contrast, the objects on the left without the metalness map
have lower reflectivity, and the reflected light tends to be white.

Next, we examine the impact of the roughness map, which controls the smoothness of the material’s
surface. We observe that the silver chess piece on the right, with a low roughness texture map,
becomes smooth, and together with metalness, produces a mirror-like reflection effect. On the other
hand, the box on the left with a roughness map exhibits changes in light dispersion on its surface,
with some areas showing highlights, while also adding and enriching scratch texture details on the
surface.

Furthermore, we compare the effects of displacement and height on objects, both of which are usually
optional and can also impact object appearance. Height maps typically use grayscale values to
represent the surface’s relative height, simulating a relief effect through changes in lighting and
shadows. As shown in the last row on the right, the object with a height map has an uneven surface,
enhancing the sense of depth. Displacement mapping is a more powerful technique that changes the

vertex positions of the geometry based on the map’s values, creating realistic relief effects. As shown
on the left, the stone sculpture with displacement mapping exhibits very realistic details and a sense
of relief. We acknowledge that the generated PBR maps are not true representations of physical maps,
but our algorithm generates PBR maps that closely approximate the visual characteristics of true PBR
properties, which significantly enhances the realism of 3D objects.

D.2
Effects of Different UV Mappings

We conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of UV mapping on our method. As shown in the
second column of Figure 17, UV mappings with excessive fragmentation and color entanglement can
cause the 2D segmented images to mix with other regions when reprojected into the UV space, leading
to material blending issues. However, our method shows good results with original artist-created UV
mappings and Blender’s built-in mapping methods in Figure 17, such as smart, sphere, and unwrap.
This indicates that our method still demonstrates good robustness with many mapping techniques.

In practice, we observe that most objects in Objaverse have UV mappings with good properties,
meaning they are not excessively fragmented into small pieces. Additionally, we can control the UV
mapping process: For some low-quality UV maps and generative objects that originally lack UV
maps, we can re-unwrap them to achieve higher quality.

We show more qualitative results of Make-it-Real for existing 3D assets from [16]. Results are shown
in Figures 20 and 21. The first row presents the original 3D object with only a albedo map, while the
second row showcases the object enhanced by our method with various material maps.

Comparisions with Artist-Created Materials. We conduct a user study comparing materials gener-
ated by our Make-it-Real with those created by artists, visualizing some results in Figure 18 for close
examination. For objects like pistol, wooden chair, speakers, and saxophone, Make-it-Real showed
strong similarity to artist-made materials, maintaining consistent metallicity, roughness, highlights,
and coloration. In cases such as shield, boots, landline phone, and oil drum, our method produced
materials that, while different, are realistic and sometimes visually superior. Our pipeline approaches
the level of refinement seen in some artist-created materials, which often require significant time and
effort, and clearly outperforms more basic and crude artist-generated materials. This highlights its
effectiveness and potential for practical applications.

E.2
Visualization of generated texture maps.

In this section, we show visualization of generated texture maps in Figures 22 and 23. Our approach,
guided by the query albedo reference, produces material maps with distinct material partitions and
maintains a distribution consistent with the albedo map. As a result, the enhanced object exhibits
both realism and texture consistency.

F
Limitations and future work

While promising results have been achieved by MLLMs for texture assignment through Make-it-Real.
Our work still faces several challenges.

Lighting Effect and Addressed Solutions. First, although our method can achieve appropriate
texture assignment for albedo-only model, it does not support reverse transform from shaded texture
map to albedo map for generated 3D objects. This causes problem of assigning different materials
to the dark shadow and highlight area when generated object with mesh already shaded in different
lighting conditions.

This issue is less pronounced in artist-created models, where albedo maps have less shadows and
lighting effects. Our tests show that the albedo obtained from inverse rendering methods [9] closely
matches the original artist-created albedo maps from the Objaverse dataset, as illustrated in the first
row of Figure 19. For generative models, baked-in shading effects are more pronounced. Our method
addresses this by integrating mature derendering algorithms [9, 14, 31, 66], specifically the Intrinsic
Anything [9], into our pipeline with minimal complexity. This integration derenders from four

25


---Page Break---
viewpoints and back-projects to obtain a better albedo map, then applies our Make-it-Real method
for material painting. As shown in the last row, this approach reduces lighting noise and supports a
wider range of inputs.

Impact of Model Quality and Segmentation. Second, we find base model quality is essential for
MLLM to assign correct materials. When base 3D object is of low quality(e.g., uneven surfaces
or mixed colors across different parts), it is difficult for MLLMs to identify object properties when
ground truth text prompt describing the object is not available. Additionally, there has been limited
progress in material segmentation in 2D and 3D demoain [52, 38]. The material segmentation
algorithm included in our proposed pipeline can serve as a useful baseline and provide inspiration for
future work. We also explore the integration of the pipeline with 3D segmentation networks, which
shows promising results. For future work, we consider methods mitigating these challenges as well
as adding user friendly control into our fully-automatic pipeline.

G
Data Ethics

The datasets utilized in our work, specifically Objaverse, is composed entirely of inanimate objects.
Importantly, the Objaverse dataset we used have undergone rigorous ethical filtering as part of the
Cap3D [41]. Cap3D’s ethical filtering process removed all potentially problematic data, including
any identifiable human elements and NSFW content (detailed in Sec 3.2 of Cap3D). This process
included the removal of objects with licenses that do not permit commercial usage, the exclusion
of objects lacking sufficient camera information for rendering, and the application of face detection
and NSFW classifiers with high thresholds to ensure thorough filtering. The final dataset used in our
work, therefore, does not contain any human-derived data or data related to human subjects.

We recognize the potential risk of misuse associated with this technology, particularly in the creation
of realistic fake human representations. However, since our dataset fully excludes human data, this
risk is substantially mitigated.

H
Broader Impacts

Potential positive societal impacts. The proposed method facilitates more realistic and accurate
representations of materials in 3D models, benefiting industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and
film, leading to more immersive and engaging experiences. By automating the material assignment
process, Make-it-Real significantly reduces the time and effort required for 3D content creators,
allowing for more efficient workflows and enabling creators to focus on more creative aspects of their
work. This approach can democratize high-quality 3D content creation by making advanced material
application techniques accessible to a broader range of users, including those without specialized
skills in graphic software.

Potential negative societal impacts. The improved realism in 3D assets could be exploited for creat-
ing highly convincing fake visuals or deepfakes, which might be used in disinformation campaigns or
to mislead audiences. There is a risk that the materials generated could inadvertently perpetuate biases
or stereotypes if the training data for GPT-4V includes biased representations of certain materials
or objects. As the method involves processing and recognizing visual data, there could be concerns
regarding the privacy of any real-world images used as inputs, particularly if they contain sensitive or
personal information.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All claims of the improvements are supported with extensive quantitative
experiments with a great amount of qualitative cases. The proposed method is tested
on many objects both sourced from Objaverse and generated by many edge-cutting 3D
generative models and proven to be effective and robust.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed discussion of limitations in Sec. F
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For main results, we detail the full test settings in Sec. 4. For GPT-4V [45]
based preference study, we provide detailed test prompts and test settings in Sup. B.5.
Readers can easily follow the same setting and reproduce all of our experiment results.

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

32


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Full experiment details is available in Sec. 4

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The full test with is time consuming mainly due to the rate limit of GPT-
4V [45] (each conversation takes around 1 minute). We improve the experiment confidence
by increasing the amount of test to hundreds of objects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

33


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our paper mainly reliance on API access to GPT-4V [45] and Blender. The
segmentation model can be deployed on any computing resources with most mainstream
GPUs with CUDA and ≥8G memory.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The authors have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics carefully and find no
conflicts with it. Potential societal impacts are answered in the next question.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Detailed discussions available in Sup. H
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

34


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Existing assets we use is a quality library of selectable real materials—we
build upon the MatSynth [61] dataset, which contains over 4,000 high resolution tileable
materials under CC0 license.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

35


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer:[NA]

Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

36


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
