Abstract

Accuracy is a commonly adopted performance metric in various classification tasks,
which measures the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples.
It assumes equal importance for all classes, hence equal severity for misclassifica-
tions. However, in the task of emotional classification, due to the psychological
similarities between emotions, misclassifying a certain emotion into one class may
be more severe than another, e.g., misclassifying ‘excitement’ as ‘anger’ apparently
is more severe than as ‘awe’. Albeit high meaningful for many applications, metrics
capable of measuring these cases of misclassifications in visual emotion recogni-
tion tasks have yet to be explored. In this paper, based on Mikel’s emotion wheel
from psychology, we propose a novel approach for evaluating the performance in
visual emotion recognition, which takes into account the distance on the emotion
wheel between different emotions to mimic the psychological nuances of emotions.
Experimental results in semi-supervised learning on emotion recognition and user
study have shown that our proposed metrics is more effective than the accuracy
to assess the performance and conforms to the cognitive laws of human emotions.

Introduction

"The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.
They must be felt with the heart."
-Helen Keller

Emotion, as a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes and in-
fluences thoughts and behavior, involves subjective experiences, physiological arousal, cognitive
appraisal and behavioral expressions [33]. Emotional similarity is a significant characteristic of
emotions, revealing the commonalities among diverse emotional states in their essence, modes of
expression, and influencing factors. And the essence of emotion can be explored through under-
standing the hierarchical nature of human cognitive processes. The Reverse Hierarchy Theory [14]
in neuroscience suggests that, instead of exhibiting absolute object classification ability, humans
first recognize coarse-grained categories and then proceed to identify finer-grained detailed infor-
mation [21, 22]. This process involves comparing with prior information to make a comparative
classification [10]. Under the same cognitive mechanism, both emotion recognition and object
recognition follow a similar pattern of recognition [24], i.e., progressing from global to local, and
from coarse-grained to fine-grained identification processes. And such emotional cognitive process
is often characterized by the term Emotion Granularity in psychology [31, 18], where it involves
the degree of nuance with which individuals can perceive. It also implies that there exists relative

Figure 1: (a) Different misclassification situations can not be treated equally. It is better to misclassify
an image labeled as ‘excitement’ as ‘awe’ than to misclassify it as ‘anger’. (b) Although the ACC of

proximity between different emotions. For instance, belonging to positive emotions, the similarity
between excitement and awe is greater than that between excitement and anger. This proximity is
often associated with a misclassification-similar phenomenon in psychology referred to as ‘affective
biased attention’, which is the tendency to pay more attention to some emotions than others. In
complex psychological conditions, people tend to show negative bias compared to positive informa-
tion, that is, they tend to use more negative information [36]. Though the emotion similarity and
affective bias have been considered when evaluating cognitive ability for humans in psychology,
the measurement of such ability for emotion recognition methods [19, 8, 25] in computer vision
field still remains within the framework of the ordinary classification task. They primarily focus on
employing global representation of objects [19], language prompts [8] or a multi-stage perception
(entity, attribute and emotion) model [25] to improve the number of correctly classified samples,
but totally ignore the influence (or severity) of different misclassifications caused by the similarity
between emotions. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the relative distances between emotions are different. And
after testing with the recent representative emotion classification methods in terms of both accuracy
and severity of misclassification in Fig. 1(b), we observed that, although the classification accuracy
has been improved to a high level, the severity of misclassification stayed at the same level or even
worse. Therefore, metrics that aligns more closely with psychological models by taking the emotional
similarity and the severity of misclassification into account are necessary for the visual emotion
recognition task.

Studies on the misclassification for other tasks can be traced back to the early ‘cost-sensitive’ problem,
where researchers employ the cost matrices to assess and enhance classifiers, but they care more
about the class imbalance in datasets rather than the costs led by misclassification. In the field of
object classification, some researchers began to pay attention to the problem of misclassification
and devised methods to measure and reduce mistake severity based on the hierarchical information
of labels [1, 12, 4]. For instance, Bertinetto et al. [1] devised the hierarchical distance of a mistake
and average hierarchical distance of top-K to quantify the severity of mistakes, and proposed the
hierarchical cross-entropy loss to reduce the severity of mistakes. Garg et al. [12] proposed to learn a
hierarchy-aware feature space to explicitly learn the hierarchy of labels during the training phase.
All these works are based on the cost definition composed of semantic hierarchical information and
lowest common ancestor, which can be traced back to WordNet [11].

However, directly applying the experience from hierarchy-based severity learning to the visual
emotion recognition task is challenging, because the multi-hierarchy relationships in object categories
do not exist in emotional categories, thus we can not utilize hierarchy information to define the
severity of misclassification. And we could not adopt additional classifier to capture the structure
available in the label space [12, 3]. While this severity is essential for designing a robust measure and
effective loss function for the visual recognition task. And prior works have pointed out that making
the classifier to learn both ground truth information and label structure will degrade the classification
accuracy [12].

To address the above-mentioned issue, we define the concept of emotional distance (or cost) for
misclassification based on the Mikel’s wheel [23, 57], and further propose novel metrics for evalu-

ating the performance of emotion classification methods using this concept as a foundation. More
specifically, we first define the cost matrix for different misclassification cases according to the
definition of the distance in [57] and of the affective polarity in Mikel’s Wheel. On the basis of the
confusion matrix between the cost matrix and the classification results, we then propose a new visual
emotion recognition evaluation measure ECC to measure all possible classification results, as well as
a measure EMC focusing more on the cases of misclassification. We verify the effectiveness of the
measures via the semi-supervised emotion recognition task, demonstrating that our metrics provide a
more robust assessment of method performance than accuracy alone. And we prove through user
study that the design of our metrics are in line with human cognition. As far as we know, both EMC
and ECC are the first metrics that evaluate the performance of visual emotion classifiction algorithms
by taking the influence of misclassifiction into consideration.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1). We are the first to introduce the concept
of mistake cost into visual emotion recognition, and propose new measures based on Mikel’s wheel
to better assess the performance of emotion classification methods. 2). In semi-supervised emotion
classification tasks, from the perspectives of threshold adjustment and model selection, on one hand,
compared to complex confidence threshold adjustment mechanisms, our measures can be more
simply yet effectively applied in the pseudo-labeling process, enhancing the model’s classification
performance. On the other hand, we demonstrate that our metrics can help select the model capable
of generating higher-quality pseudo-labels that are beneficial for training. 3). Finally, we discussed
the relationship between our metrics and ACC2, and we further validate our metrics through user
study, confirming that they provide results consistent with human emotional cognition in evaluating
the severity of sample misclassification by the model.

Visual Emotion Recognition

With the advent of deep learning, many methods [60, 30, 53, 38, 49, 29, 46, 42, 56, 54, 55] have
begun to use convolutional neural network (CNN) for visual emotion recognition. Many of these
researchers have explored the relationship between emotions. Based on Plutchik’s [28] theory that
different emotions have different similarities. Zhao et al. [57] proposed the emotional distance for
the first time based on Mikel’s Wheel, which is used to calculate the emotional similarity between
two pairs of pictures. In addition, Yang et al. [46] designed affective polarity on Mikel’s wheel and
proposed a new hierarchical cross-entropy loss to distinguish between difficult and easy cases in
a specific emotional way. Inspired by the large-scale pretrained language models, Deng et al. [8]
propose a fine-tuning strategy based on prompts. Pan et al. [25] generate pseudo labels through
visual language models as auxiliary guidance for multi-stage visual perception. However, due to the
ambiguity and subjectivity of emotions, a single image often elicits multiple emotional responses,
when dealing with visual emotion recognition tasks, it is more reasonable to use label distribution
than single label classification. In [48], they generate sentiment distributions from a single emotion
dataset based on emotional distance to solve this problem. Moveover, inspired by the inherent
relationship between emotions in psychology. Yang et al. [45] propose a well-based circular structure
representation to use prior knowledge to learn visual emotion distribution. However, these efforts
mainly focused on improving accuracy, ignoring the fact that the severity of misclassification is not
the same for different classification results, and at the same time, the constraints of fitting the label
distribution may be strict, which often have the opposite effect.

2.2
Cost-Sensitive Classification

The importance of studying misclassification has attracted a lot of attention in the era of machine
learning, but it has been neglected in the era of deep learning. In the field of machine learning, Wei et
al. [40] proposed the measure of confusion entropy to evaluate the performance of classifiers, which
utilizes the distribution information of misclassified categories for all categories. This problem is also
described as ‘cost-sensitive’ by introducing the cost imbalance between different misclassifications in
real-world applications, and providing solutions that meet practical needs. Classic problems include
bank lending issues, disease diagnosis issues [9, 51, 4], etc. The most common cost-sensitive solution
is rescaling, which mainly preprocesses the training set to improve the sensitivity to classification
results. Specifically, Turney [35] studies how to choose the correct cost assignment in cost-sensitive

---Page Break---
classification problems, and further explores the meaning and impact of cost values. Metacost [9]
calculates the ideal class for each training sample by estimating the posterior probability density of
the training samples and modifies the class of the original training sample to change the new data set.
Different from the previous approaches, Zhou et al. [59] pointed out that in addition to the correction
of the classification algorithm and dataset, the cost matrix needs to be corrected, which solves the
problem that it is often ineffective for multi-class cost-sensitive learning. However, this kind of
problem focuses more on the class imbalance of the dataset, and gradually loses interest in the cost of
misclassification.

2.3
Hierarchy Aware Classification

In recent years, a small part of the work has begun to focus on the problem of the mistake severity
and devised methods to reduce it. Deng et al. [6] pointed out that classification can be improved by
using semantic hierarchical information from WordNet [11], which laid the foundation for future
research. Furthermore, Bertinetto et al. [1] summarized and analyzed the issue of mistake severity,
and proposed hierarchical cross-entropy loss to reduce the severity of mistakes. They also introduced
two measures, hierarchical distance of a mistake and average hierarchical distance of top-K, to
quantify the severity of misclassification. However, reducing the severity of misclassification is
premised on reducing accuracy. Karthik et al. [17] use Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) to
improve this shortcoming, reducing the severity of mistakes without compromising accuracy. But
CRM doesn’t change the model, it’s about making the best choice of the moment during the testing
phase. In order to solve this problem elegantly, Garg et al. [12] propose to learn a Hierarchy Aware
Feature(HAF) space to explicitly learn the hierarchy of labels during the training phase. In [15],
they train two separate models for coarse-grained and fine-grained, and make the final prediction
by calculating the normalized scores of the two models in the reasoning process. Although some
progress have been made in these studies in the direction of hierarchical labeling, there is still a
lack of research in visual emotion recognition. Different from they use lowest common ancestor
(LCA) measure to assess the severity of mistakes, we define our measures based on Mikel’s wheel
and confusion matrix, and demonstrate their effectiveness.

Misclassification-Aware Measure Design

3.1
Definition of Emotional Distance

In almost classification tasks, accuracy serves as an important evaluation metric, measuring the
model’s capacity of predicting categories. However, this measure is built on a binary philosophy, i.e.,
only considering whether or not the predicted category matches the true label. In fact, distinguishing
between different types of mismatch is meaningful, particularly in the field of emotion classification.
For example, due to the similarity between emotions, misclassifying ‘excitement’ as ‘awe’ may be
acceptable in certain diagnose, while misclassifying it as ‘sadness’ could lead to severe diagnostic
errors in clinic psychology. Based on this reasoning, we therefore define emotional distances to
characterize their relative relationships, and further to aid in quantifying the degree of severity of
misclassification. Existing psychological models such as CES and DES, either model emotions as
completely independent categories or represent them as multidimensional continuous vectors. The
former ignores the similarity between emotions, while the latter requires precise measurement of
emotions by experts, which can be hard to achieve for visual emotion recognition task. In [57], authors
provide a definition between emotional labels based on Mikel’s wheel, where the paired emotional
distance is 1+ ‘wheel distance’. The ‘wheel distance’ means the number of steps when moving from
one category to another on the wheel like shown in Fig. 2 (a). However, this definition of emotion
distance neglects the emotional polarity [47], e.g., the distance between ‘fear’ and ‘excitement’ being
the same as the distance between ‘fear’ and ‘sadness’. But the distance between categories with
opposite polarity should be greater than those with the same polarity, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). We thus
define the emotional distance as follows:

Wi,j =
1 + dist (ei, ej)
ei, ej ∈Cp
C + dist (ei, ej)
ei, ej /∈Cp
,
(1)

where dist (ei, ej) represents the number of steps on the Mikel’s wheel, C is a constant to adapt the
importance of polarity, and a larger C means misclassifying one emotion into the opposite polarity

‘excitement’. (c) The correspondence between the three measures of ACC, ECC and EMC in the

is more severe, and we define C as 4 in order to ensure that the emotional distance within the
same polarity is always less than the emotional distance between different polarities. Cp represents
the classes that have the same polarity. We can finally obtain a symmetric cost matrix with each
element being the distance between the corresponding emotions. Although our emotional distance
is defined based on Mikel’s wheel for classifying eight emotions, it is important to note that when
calculating the classification of six emotions based on Ekman’s model, we can still use a similar
method for determining emotional distances. To achieve it, we can initially follow the definition used
by Mikel’s wheel, calculating the emotional distances for the same emotions present in both models.
Subsequently, we can adjust the distances between opposite emotion labels based on emotional
polarity. Due to the inherent nature of the distance definition in Mikel’s Wheel, our main focus here
is on the issue of classifying the eight categories of emotions.

3.2
Emotion Confusion Confidence (ECC)

Wei et al. [40] used the category distribution information of all categories of misclassification to
propose the concept of confusion entropy to measure the standard. Inspired by them, we design our
measures based on a confusion matrix. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), the confusion matrix is defined as a
N×N matrix, where N represents the number of classes. The rows of the confusion matrix represent
the true labels, while the columns represent the predicted ones. Each element in Si,j represents the
number of samples classified from the correct category i to the category j. The diagonal elements of
the confusion matrix represents the number of samples correctly classified for each class. Hence the
sum of diagonal elements of confusion matrix Nc divided by the total number of samples N represents
ACC. While other elements represent the number of samples belonging to the category i that are
wrongly classified into category j. The drawback of accuracy lies in its exclusive consideration
of correct classifications along the diagonal of the confusion matrix, while disregarding equally
important misclassifications elsewhere in the matrix. This implies that accuracy may be misleadingly
high in scenarios of class imbalance. Although directly using the confusion matrix as a metric
allows for the consideration of both correct and incorrect classifications (misclassifications), this
metric overlooks the distance between emotions in psychology. To take both correct classifications,
misclassifications and emotional distance into evaluation, we propose to use emotional distance to
modulate the confusion matrix. Based on this design philosophy, the ACC can be re-formulated as
the product of the confusion matrix and a modulation factor Mi,j as:

ACC = Nc

N =

Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1 Si,j × Mi,j

N
, Mi,j =
1
i = j
0
i ̸= j ,
(2)

where c denotes the number of all classes, Nc represents the count of correct classifications. It implies
that one sample is counted as 1 only if it is correctly classified, other misclassified samples are not
distinguished and are all recorded as 0. However, as we explained previously, misclassifications can
be acceptable to some extent when the emotional classes are similar. Thus we tackle these samples

5


---Page Break---
as ‘quasi correctly classified samples’ and weighted with a value between (0, 1). The smaller the
similarity of emotions, the less acceptable the misclassified sample becomes, hence the smaller
the corresponding value it will have, and vice versa. To achieve this, we rely on the reciprocal of
the emotional distance Wi,j defined in Eq. 1 to replace the modulation factor Mi,j in Eq. 2 for the
misclassified samples to obtain ECC in Eq. 3.

ECC =

Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1 Si,j ×
1
Wi,j
N
= ACC +

Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1,i̸=j Si,j ×
1
Wi,j
N
(3)

In this way, misclassified samples are no longer simply neglected like in ACC, but have weights
in terms of emotional distances, which also means that our measure ECC make use of the entire
confusion matrix, including elements both inside and outside the diagonal as shown in Fig. 2(c).

3.3
Emotional Misclassification Confidence (EMC)

In some practical scenarios, people pay more attention to cases of misclassification, like estimating
the severity of misdiagnosis of a certain mental diease, while both ACC and ECC include the cases
of correct classification, hence failing to provide information about misclassification. Therefore, in
order to only consider the cases of misclassification, one can extract the term (Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1,i̸=j Si,j ×
1
Wi,j )/N that excludes ACC from Eq. 3 as an indicator for evaluating misclassification. However,
directly using this terms as a misclassification measure is inappropriate for two reasons: 1). The
denominator of this term is N, indicating that its value is still influenced by correct classified samples,
rather than solely considering the misclassified samples. 2). The maximal value of this term is 0.5,
which we hope to be 1 as ACC and ECC. We accordingly modify this term and propose a novel
measure for misclassification description in Eq. 4, named Emotional Misclassification Confidence
(EMC):

EMC =

Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1,i̸=j Si,j ×
1
Wi,j−1
N −Nc
(4)

This metric considers only misclassifed samples Si,j, i ̸= j and their number N −Nc, meanwhile
modifying the modulation factor from
1
Wi,j to
1
Wi,j−1 to ensure a maximum value of 1.

In this way, we have an ECC that measures the overall classification results, as well as EMC that is
specially designed to measure the severity of misclassification. The cooperation of two measures can
better evaluate the visual emotion recognition task.

Experiments and Results

4.1
Datasets

We evaluate our metrics on two widely applied datasets EmoSet [44] and FI [50]. EmoSet is based on
Mikel’s eight-categorical sentiment model, which uses 810 keywords and collects from four different
sources, including openverse, pexels, pixabay and rawpixels. It covers different emotional attributes,
i.e., low-level (brightness and colorfulness), mid-level (scene type and object class), and high-level
(facial expression and human action). Finally, 60 annotators who passed the test annotated a total of
118,102 images. The FI dataset was collected from Flickr and Instagram through eight sentiment
keywords, and was built based on Mikel’s eight-category sentiment model, which contains about
23,308 images.

4.2
Applications to Semi-Supervised Emotion Recognition

Because of the ambiguity of emotions [16], annotating high-quality and large-scale datasets for visual
emotion recognition is arduous and challenging. Semi-supervised learning is an effective solution
which consists of training the model based on both labeled and unlabeled data, then annotating
unlabled examples by this trained model. While for pesudo labeling based semi-supervised learning
methods, selecting appropriate models and labeling confidence thresholds play key roles in determin-
ing the final performance. In this section, we carry out experiments on two perspectives: the model
selection and the adjustment of labeling threshold, to demonstrate how our proposed measures can
benefit this task.

4.2.1
Adjustment of Confidence Threshold

For pseudo label-based semi-supervised learning methods, a confidence threshold is used to determine
whether current labeled samples are filtered will directly affect the number of training samples and
the proportion of correct labels in each epoch: a high threshold will excessively filter out high-quality
unlabeled data, leading to insufficient training data, while a low threshold will allow more low-quality
unlabeled data, making the model converge to a poor local minima. How to select an appropriate
threshold of pseudo-labeling in the training process has always been a hotspot for semi-supervised
learning [5]. Existing methods either use an intuitive constant threshold [32] that is widely adopted
in other semi-supervised learning tasks, or a dynamic threshold that varies in terms of the estimated
learning status [52]. Considering that EMC can measure the severity of misclassification, we therefore
recommend using EMC to dynamically adjust the confidence threshold before each epoch. This is
similar to how, in a clinical scenario, a patient not only refers to the doctor’s current confidence in the
diagnosis but also takes into account the doctor’s historical reputation (frequency of misdiagnoses
and medical errors) to ultimately judge the reliability of the current diagnosis. For semi-supervised
emotion recognition tasks, since there are only a few labeled samples available for training, the model
can easily overfit these samples, resulting in all correct predictions and thus making it impossible to
calculate EMC. To address this situation without introducing additional training data or increasing
computational payload, we treat the pseudo-labels generated from weakly augmented unlabeled
samples as the ground truth, and use the predicted labels from strongly augmented samples as the
model’s predictions to calculate EMC. Since the labels of the same sample should remain consistent
under different data augmentation methods, a large EMC indicates that the model provide similar
emotional predictions with different augment methods. This suggests that the model has grasped
the underlying visual elements that represent emotions in images, which reflects the reliability and
high quality of the pseudo labels. Therefore, we can lower the confidence threshold, allowing more
pseudo-labeled samples to participate in the training process. On the contrary, when the EMC is
small, we can raise the threshold and filter out the low-quality samples. We can realize the above
confidence adjustment mechanism by simply setting:

τ ′
t = τ ·
e
EMCt
,
(5)

where τ is the pre-defined threshold, τ ′
t is the new threshold at time step t, EMCt represents the
EMC at time step t, e is a constant for different datasets. We define τ as 0.95. For FI, we define e as
0.5, and for EmoSet, we define e as 0.4. And we set the upper and lower bounds of τ ′
t to 0.98 and
0.7 [16] respectively to ensure stability of the training process.

To test the effectiveness of our proposed confidence adjustment mechanism built on EMC, we com-
pared it with two representative pesudo labeling based methods, Fixmatch [32] and Flexmatch [52],

where Fixmatch directly provides a fixed threshold, while Flexmatch assigns dynamic thresholds
to each class according to corresponding learning status. Experimental results in Tab. 1 show that,
thanks to our EMC-based threshold mechanism, our method is over 1% better than Flexmatch and
Fixmatch. Additionally, let us note that unlike the method Flexmatch that adjusts the threshold for
every category, we evaluate the entire ublabeled data based on a statistical perspective, and adjust the
overall threshold after measuring the EMC, which is computationally low-cost. And the experiment
is followed by [32].

4.2.2
Selection of Better Pseudo Labeling Models

Existing methods that typically use ACC to measure the model’s capability of discriminating between
categories of unlabeled samples, i.e., models with higher ACC can provide more reliable pesudo label.
However, such models often suffer from the problem of confirmation bias [34], where the model
will gradually deepen this error during the learning process. Accumulation of these errors eventually
leads to the final model being unable to achieve good classification performances. As both ECC and
EMC are designed based on the consideration of the cases of misclassification, which means they can
better distinguish the ambiguity of labels, and models selected in terms of ECC or EMC will less
effected by the cumulative confirmation bias, providing high-quality labels than those based on ACC.

To prove that model with higher ECC or EMC is better for pesudo labeling, we train the same network
with different loss functions: cross-entropy loss LCE and the combination of cross-entropy loss and
order-based loss ListMLE [41] as Lc = LCE +αLListMLE, where α is 1 and LListMLE aims to constrain
the final prediction probability of the samples to follow a preset order, thus favoring higher ECC
and EMC (proved in Appendix A). This constraint will reduce the severity of misclassification, at
the same time, the cost is to reduce ACC [1], specific experiment is in Appendix B. More precisely,
we first train the model with LCE, once it starts to converge (the model has preliminary ability of
recognition), we then keep the same loss function or replace LCE with Lc to make it continue to
focus on the correct classification or focus more on the cases of misclassification. Therefore, models
trained solely using LCE exhibit better ACC but limited capability to distinguish error samples, and
the quality of the pseudo label is poor. Although the pseudo labels might still be incorrect compared
to the ground truth when using a combined loss function for training the model, the pseudo-labels
become closer to the ground truth. In such cases, these pseudo labels can still have a positive impact
on the training process and thereby improve the model’s accuracy. As we show in Tab. 1, we adopt the
state-of-the-art method S2-VER [16] as our baseline, as it generates more reliable pseudo labels by

calculating the similarity between emotional prototypes and samples, but ignores the error of pseudo
labels. We follow the experimental setting of [16] and vary the proportions of the labeled samples
as 0.5%, 5% and 10% (corresponding to 80, 800, 1600 label number for FI, and 400, 4000, 8000
label number for EmoSet), it can be observed that under the different settings of the two datasets,
our method performs favorably against S2-VER by 1% in accuracy. Meanwhile, our method also far
surpasses multiple state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised learning. It indicates that choosing a
model with better misclassification ability (better ECC and EMC) can produce pseudo labels of better
quality and beneficial to the training process, thus achieving better semi-supervised performance.

4.3
Compare with Other Measure

ACC2 is a very important binary classification metric in the field of emotion recognition [43, 8, 26, 44],
used to measure whether the classification to the same emotional polarity is correct. More specifically,
when a sample labeled as ‘excitement’ is classified as ‘awe’, it is incorrect to use accuracy for
evaluation. However, for metrics like ACC2, such a classification is considered correct. In a
certain sense, metrics like ACC2, which involve coarse-grained classification, take into account the
proximity of labels and consider misclassified cases. This approach aligns with the objectives of
our measures. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics, As mentioned above, we
conducted experiments using both the cross-entropy loss LCE and the combined loss Lc. As shown in
Tab. 2, although the accuracy of the combined loss is lower than that of the cross-entropy loss, its
ACC2 is higher. This indicates the shortcomings of using accuracy alone in certain situations, as it
fails to measure for misclassifications. Although the ECC also decreased due to the influence of the
ACC, since the ECC takes into account the situation of misclassification, the gap between the two
models in terms of ECC is not significant. As EMC considers metrics for misclassification alone, the
EMC of the combined loss is significantly higher than that of the cross-entropy loss. In this regard,
the trend of EMC aligns with that of ACC2, which also demonstrates the correlation between the
two metrics. In the confusion matrix, ACC2 actually represents the proportion of correctly classified
samples in the top-left and bottom-right sections. This also indicates that our measures are actually
more refined measures that lies between Accuracy and ACC2.

4.4
User Study

Since our metrics is founded on principles of human cognition, we aim to further demonstrate that
our measures align with human judgments in emotion classification results via user study.

Data preparation In order to have models having different levels of ECC, we take ResNet50 as
our network backbone and train it respectively with cross-entropy loss and combined loss Lc =
LCE + αLListMLE on the FI dataset, where α is 0.2. Then we perform predictions on the test set
and select the images that are misclassified by both two models into different classes. Finally we
randomly select 50 eligible images, and filter out the images with no obvious emotion or ambiguous
emotion, getting 30 carefully selected images as our tested images for user study.

Preference Study We invite 30 participants having different social backgrounds to our user preference
study, and the test for every participant lasts about 15 minutes. During the test session, each
misclassified image will be presented to participants with three options: the incorrect class predicted

Results In all 900 collected votes, 487 votes are cast for the results produced by the model with
higher ECC, while 242 votes opt for the results generated by the model with higher ACC. There are
171 votes that opted for unidentifiable choices. Fig. 3 further shows the distribution of the votes for
each image, where we can observe that among 30 tested images, users preferred the classification
results provided by the model with higher ECC over the model with higher ACC for 24 images,
representing 80% of the total tested images.

Validity of Emotional Distance Definitions

We want to further explore the rationality of the defined emotional distance and determine whether it
can help models learn the semantic structure of labels. To answer the above question, we transform
emotional distance into ranking, and designed three sets of experiments based on Lc and α is 1. The
specific experiments are shown in Table 3. And the specific experimental settings are detailed in
Appendix C. Since we are only focusing on the impact of emotional rank (emotional distance) on
the model, and changing the rank of ground truth label would prevent the model from training on
correct classification categories. So we randomly shuffle and reverse the rank of the other labels
while keeping the category with the first position in the emotional rank as the ground truth. Then,
according to the changed order, use ListMLE for training. As shown in Table 3. Our rank achieve
advanced performance in three measures. And the results are worse in reverse rank than random rank,
and they are significantly worse than our rank. This shows that our rank is better, in line with human
cognition of label rank, and our label rank will help the model learn the emotion category structure.
Although the ranking of ground truth has not changed, a reasonable label ranking can often reflect
the emotional and visual element relationship between images, which will enable the model to mine
the visual and semantic correlation between similar categories, so as to learn a better label semantic
structure. We have proven the rationality of emotional distance through above experiments. Since
the new measures ECC and EMC are designed based on emotional distance, it also validates the
rationality of our measures.

Conclusions

In this work, we define the concept of misclassification in the field of visual emotion recognition,
and propose new measures to evaluate the mistake severity in visual emotion recognition based on
Mikel’s Wheel distance. We define our emotional distance using the Mikel wheel and adopt it to
build cost matrix, then exert it to confusion matrix to compute emotion confusion confidence (ECC)
and emotional mistakes confidence (EMC). And we demonstrate that our measures are more robust in
semi-supervised learning. Our measures can not only help to select the model that can produce high-
quality pseudo labels, but also can be used as a reference standard to adjust the threshold adaptively.
Moreover, we verify that our new measures are consistent with human emotional cognition through
user study. Finally, we verify the validity of our emotional distance.

Appendix

A
Proof of the Relationship between New Measures and ListMLE

In this chapter, we mainly analyze the relationship between ACC and cross-entropy, ListMLE and
ECC. To prove that the relationship between ListMLE and ECC is equal to the relationship between
cross-entropy and ACC. so as to explain why ListMLE can be used as a backbone between ECC.
First of all, let’s review the formula of cross-entropy loss:

Lce = −1

n

n
X

i=1

c
X

j=1
yij log fj(xi; θ),
(6)

where n represents the number of samples and c represents the number of categories. yij represents
the jth element of one-hot encoded label of the sample xi. θ is the parameter set of the classifier.
fj(xi; θ) represents the probability that the prediction of the ith sample is of category j.

For a single sample, the formula becomes:

Lce = −

c
X

j=1
yj log fj(x; θ)
(7)

However, the formula of ACC is:

ACC =

Pc
j=1
Pc
i=1 Si,j × Mi,j

N
(8)

In fact, the effect of yj is the same as that of Mi,j. the optimization goal of cross-entropy is to
maximize the prediction probability of real categories, while ACC only calculates the number of
samples predicted to the correct category.

In fact, the cross-entropy loss is also sensitive to the order. According to the paper [2], the cross-
entropy loss can be written in the form of likelihood loss. Suppose that π is a permutation of n objects,
and ϕ is a strictly increasing positive function, then the probability of permutation π of a given score
list s is defined as

Ps(π) =

n
Y

j=1

ϕ
 
sπ(j)


Pn
k=j ϕ
 
sπ(k)

(9)

In addition, Top One Probability is defined as:

Ps(j) =
X

π(1)=j,π∈Ωn
Ps(π)
(10)

If the predicted ranking score for a given category is given, then the cross-entropy is equal to the row
that wants to put ground truth first in the ranking:

Lce = −

c
X

j=1
yj log fj(x; θ) ≈−log Ps(j),
(11)

If we want to consider the label correlation in the following sorting function, we only need to change
the permutation probability of Packers (j) to the sorting expectation for all categories. If we want to
consider the label correlation in the later sorting function, we only need to change the permutation
probability of Ps(j) to the sorting expectation for all categories.

LListMLE = −log Ps(π)
(12)

Here, we get the expectation permutation π, which is the emotional distance that we define. The
transformation of the likelihood function form of cross-entropy into ListMLE form is actually the
probability arrangement of prediction, from what is expected to be the first element to expecting all
elements to satisfy our defined element arrangement. So in terms of formula, the difference between
ECC and ACC is the difference in weight Mi,j and
1
Wi,j . So in terms of formula, ACC is transformed

Figure 4: In EmoSet, Eq. 14 is compared with the t-SNE graph [37] between alpha equals 0 and 1,
where the left two pictures are the results of Resnet18 [13], and the right two pictures are the results
of Resnet50.

In this way, we clearly explain the relationship between ACC and cross-entropy, and put forward the
expectation of emotional label arrangement on the basis of emotional distance, so as to transform
ACC and cross-entropy into ECC and ListMLE, that is, why ListMLE can be used as the backbone
of ACC.

B
Experiment Analysis

Here we further explore the performance of ListMLE in visual emotion recognition tasks. The
ListMLE loss function is designed to constrain the final prediction probability of the sample to
conform to a given rank arrangement. According to the emotional distance in Eq. 1 defined
in the measure, we convert it into the label order to cooperate with ListMLE for training. For
example, if a image is labeled excitement, the defined labels are sorted from front to back as
excitement,awe,contentment,amusement,fear,sadness,disgust and anger. We mix ListMLE with
cross-entropy loss, where α is a hyperparameter to adjust the proportion of ListMLE.

Lc = LCE + αLListMLE,
(14)

We compare ListMLE and cross-entropy loss on three backbone. The details are in Tab. 4. Similar to
the conclusion of previous work [1], when focusing on the results of misclassification, accuracy will
be reduced to some extent. When alpha is 1.0, because accuracy decreases more, ECC is worse than
only using cross-entropy loss, but EMC performs best. When alpha is equal to 0.2, a better trade-off
is reached between ACC and EMC, and ECC reaches the highest. In order to further emphasize
the difference between ListMLE and cross-entropy, we present the visual comparison diagram in
Fig. 4. It can be seen that the visualization result of ListMLE has a better clustering effect, and the
relationship between categories is easier to distinguish, and it is more consistent with our defined
emotional distance, indicating that ListMLE has learned the label structure information of emotion.
Furthermore, this indicates a high correlation between our measures and tasks involving clustering,
such as emotional image retrieval.

Implementation Details

The above experiments Tab. 4 and Tab. 3 are carried out on three backbone, including ResNet18,
ResNet50 and ResNet101 [13]. All models used pretrained weights in ImageNet [7] before training.
For FI , all train images were resized to 256 * 256. To reduce overfitting, we randomly crop the
image to 224 * 224 and flip it horizontally randomly. For test images, we also resize the image to
256 * 256, then make a 224*224 crop in the center of it. For EmoSet, we follow the experimental
setup of the author [44] for the transform of the dataset. We use SGD with a momentum of 0.9 to
optimize the network and we use a learning rate of 0.001. After 60 epochs, we decay the learning
rate to 0.0002. Specifically, We warm up in the first epoch, which means the learning rate gradually
increases to 0.001 in each iteration. The batch size of training data is 64. We are based on Pytorch for
our experiments [27].

All experiments 4 3 1 are performed on two RTX 3090 GPUs. Each of these GPU has 24 GB of
memory. For each set of experiments, it takes one to two days to use an RTX 3090.

D
Limitation

Finally, we would like to discuss the limitations of this work. For the threshold adjustment method in
semi-supervised learning, we only introduce a simple and direct method. However, using our measures
to guide the adjustment of thresholds in semi-supervised learning provides a novel perspective that
deserves further investigation. Moreover, we should explore the application of our new measures in
more fields, such as pre-training models and large language models, to fully validate the effectiveness
of our measures.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We propose new measures in visual emotion recognition, and verify the
effectiveness of our measures through semi-supervised experiments and user study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the limitation of our work in Appendix D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors

17


---Page Break---
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: the paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly describe the process of constructing the measures and conduct-
ing the validation experiments. In addition, a complete set of code is provided in the
supplementary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

18


---Page Break---
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We submitted the complete code in the supplemental material and the code
will be publicly available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

19


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The details of all semi-supervised experiments follow S2-VER [16] and
FixMatch [32], and other experimental details are explained in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: As shown in Tab. 1, we conducted three sets of experiments each and reported
their mean values and standard deviations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We explained in Appendix C that all the experiments were carried out on two
RTX 3090 GPUs and each set of experiments need use one GPUs for one to two days.And
our research doesn’t need more computing resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

20


---Page Break---
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, our research conduct in our paper conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics
in every respect.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve privacy disclosure or any other contents that may
cause social impact.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no such risk in our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

21


---Page Break---
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We clearly marked the work of follow in the paper, and these works
are all open source according to the rules.
Where Fixmatch
[32] is in
https://
github.com/google-research/fixmatch and S2-VER [16] is in https://github.
com/exped1230/S2-VER
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have released our new measures ECC and EMC, and provided the code in
the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

22


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the paper, we explain the specific way of user study in subsection 4.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There are no potential risks in our research.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
