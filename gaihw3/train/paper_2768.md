Abstract

Large numbers of synthesized videos from diffusion models pose threats to infor-
mation security and authenticity, leading to an increasing demand for generated
content detection. However, existing video-level detection algorithms primarily
focus on detecting facial forgeries and often fail to identify diffusion-generated
content with a diverse range of semantics. To advance the field of video forensics,
we propose an innovative algorithm named Multi-Modal Detection(MM-Det) for
detecting diffusion-generated videos. MM-Det utilizes the profound perceptual
and comprehensive abilities of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) by generating
a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) from LMM’s multi-modal space,
enhancing its ability to detect unseen forgery content. Besides, MM-Det leverages
an In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism for feature augmentation in
the spatio-temporal domain. A dynamic fusion strategy helps refine forgery repre-
sentations for the fusion. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive diffusion video
dataset, called Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF), across a wide range of forgery
videos. MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance in DVF, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our algorithm. Both source code and DVF are available at link.

Introduction

Figure 1: Multi-Modal Detection (MM-Det)
leverages features from spatiotemporal (ST)
information ( ), a CLIP encoder [39] ( ), and
an LMM ( ). The Fused feature ( ) achieves
state-of-the-art performance in our Diffusion
Video Forensics (DVF) dataset.

Recent years have witnessed significant advance-
ments in diffusion generative methods, which have
led to the creation of extraordinarily visually com-
pelling content in video generation [5, 4, 61]. Al-
though the latest generated videos impress society
with their versatility and stability, synthetic media
also poses a risk of malicious attacks, such as coun-
terfeit faces created by deepfakes [49] and falsifi-
cations in business, raising public concerns about
information security and privacy. In response to such
issues, researchers have made significant progress in
forgery detection, addressing problems on image edit-
ing manipulation [60, 30, 17] and CNN-synthesized
images [53, 40, 55, 36, 18]. To enhance the trustwor-
thiness and reliability of current detectors in the face
of evolving generative video methods, we aim to de-
velop a generalizable detection method for diffusion-
based generative videos.

Figure 2: LMMs detect visual artifacts and anomalies, offering detailed textual reasoning that
explains whether the image is generated using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The powerful
representation in the visual domain enables LMMs to understand complex contexts within frames.
Furthermore, their advanced language reasoning capability implicitly reveals image authenticity
and provenance. For instance, the term like “consistent shape” refers to common features in
authentic content, while “unrealistic color” signifies typical artifacts in forged content. This
linguistic proficiency stems from the superior perception and comprehension abilities of LMMs,
contributing to a generalizable multimodal feature space. By leveraging the visual understanding and
textual reasoning abilities of LMMs, we construct a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR).

Previously, the video forensics community emphasized more on developing facial forgery detection
algorithms [57, 73, 10, 62, 70], which may struggle to address recent fraudulent videos (e.g., sora, pika,
etc.). Compared to facial forgery, diffusion-based generated content contains more diverse semantics,
making it more challenging to distinguish diffusion forgery contents from real ones. Towards these
challenges, a new thread of research on CNN-generated image detection has emerged [53, 40, 55, 36,
18]. These works aim to learn common generation traces in image-level content, but do not design
specific mechanisms to capture temporal inconsistencies in videos.

Therefore, previous defensive efforts might not be able to provide a video-level detection algorithm for
newly emerged generated videos with diverse manipulation artifacts and visual contexts. Meanwhile,
Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) show unparalleled problem-solving ability [2, 24, 23, 75, 69, 28],
thanks to its powerful multi-modal representations. However, such representations are barely studied
in the video forensics task.

Motivated by the limitation of previous work and the unprecedented understanding ability of LMMs,
we propose a video-level detection algorithm, named Multi-Modal Detection (MM-Det), to capture
forgery traces based on an LMM-based multi-modal representation. MM-Det takes advantage of the
perception and reasoning capabilities of LMMs to learn a generalizable forgery feature, as depicted
in Fig. 2. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use LMMs for video forensic work.

Aside from multi-modal representations, two common sources of generative errors that can be
leveraged for video discrimination are spatial artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach
aims to effectively identify these two types of errors as an auxiliary feature in forgery detection.
Inspired by the previous work [55, 33, 41] that shows the effectiveness of reconstruction for detecting
diffusion images, we extend this idea into the video domain, amplifying diffusion artifacts both
in spatial and temporal information. To capture such artifacts efficiently, we leverage a Vector
Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) [51] for a fast reconstruction process, as detailed in
Fig. 3. Moreover, we design a novel In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) into a Transformer-
based network, which balances frame-level forgery traces with information flow across frames, thus
aggregating local and global features.

Although diffusion methods demonstrate strong capabilities in video generation, the lack of public
datasets on diffusion videos hinders research efforts in the video forensic community. In light of this,

we have established a comprehensive dataset for diffusion-generated videos, named Diffusion Video
Forensics (DVF). DVF includes generated content from a variety of diffusion models, featuring rich
semantics and high quality, serving as a general benchmark for open-world video forensics tasks.

Given an encoder E and a decoder D of a VQ-VAE
and taking the input video v, the reconstructed
video v′ is obtained as v′ = D(E(v)). The VQ-
VAE reconstruction of real images exhibits obvi-
ous edges and visible traces, whereas diffusion-
generated ones are reconstructed more effectively,
offering residual difference images with fewer vis-
ible traces.

The main contributions of this paper are as fol-
lows:

⋄We propose a detection method called MM-
Det that leverages a Multi-Modal Forgery Rep-
resentation from LMMs to effectively detect
diffusion-generated videos with strong gener-
alization capability.

⋄A powerful and innovative In-and-Across
Frame Attention (IAFA) mechanism is intro-
duced to aggregate global and local patterns
within forged videos, enhancing the detection of
spatial artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.

⋄We introduce a large-scale dataset, named the
Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset, com-
prising high-quality forged videos generated us-
ing 8 diffusion-based methods. The DVF dataset
contains diverse forgery types across videos of
varying resolutions and durations, effectively
serving as a benchmark for forgery detection in
real-world scenarios.

⋄Our MM-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the DVF dataset. Also, a detailed
analysis is provided to showcase the effectiveness of multi-modal representations in detecting
forgeries, paving the way for compelling opportunities for using LMMs in future multi-media
forensic research.

Related Works

Frame-level Detector Early work [53, 22, 13, 47, 65, 16] observed that forgery traces exist in images
generated by AI techniques, and such traces are commonly used as evidence to distinguish diffusion-
generated content [40, 6, 7] and attribute if two images are generated by the same method [66, 37].
However, identifying unseen and diverse frequency-based clues in real-world scenarios is challenging.
For that, existing frame-level forgery detectors concentrate on improving the generalization ability.
For example, some works [36, 8, 17, 26, 29] introduced features from pre-trained CLIP [39] encoders
for the forensic task to help reduce the overfitting issue on specific forgery types and increase
the robustness towards detection [36, 8] and localization [17]. [64] and [12] proposed proactive
methods to protect images from manipulation based on image watermarking and steganography. Also,
reconstruction errors through the inversion process of DDIM [44] are studied by prior works [55,
33, 41, 32] for diffusion generative content detection. Moreover, the previous work [63, 46, 34, 18]
develops specific techniques that increase the generalization to unseen forgeries. For example, HiFi-
Net [18] proposes a tree structure to model the inherent hierarchical correlation among different
forgery methods, NPR [46] devises a special representation as generative artifacts, and the training set
diversity can also contribute to generalization ability [34]. Unlike prior works, our MM-Det leverages
multi-modal reasoning to achieve a high level of generalization ability.

Video-level Detector Early video-level methods primarily focused on detecting facial forgery. For
example, [25] learned the boundary artifacts between the original background and manipulated
faces. [19] discriminated fake videos from the inconsistency of mouth motion. [73] designed a
multi-attentional detector to capture deepfake features and artifacts. F3Net [38] captured global and
local forgery traces in the frequency domain. [10, 15, 74, 56] explored temporal information and
inconsistency from fake videos. Most recently, DD-VQA [70] formulates deepfake detection as a
sentence-generation problem, largely improving the interpretation of deepfake detection. However,
these studies are restricted to facial forgery methods, which are insufficient for the current defensive
systems that address diverse content produced by diffusion models. Therefore, we develop MM-Det
to detect diffusion video content, pushing forward the frontier of forgery video detection.

Figure 4: Multi-Modal Detection network (MM-Det) architecture. Given an input video X, the
Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) branch takes the frame and instructions to generate Multi-Modal
Forgery Representation (MMFR). Hidden states from the visual encoder and large language model are
extracted to form the MMFR, denoted as FM, which helps capture the forgery traces among different
diffusion-generated videos. In the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch, videos are first reconstructed via
a VQ-VAE, and then fed into a CNN encoder, followed by In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA)
modules detailed in Sec. 3.2. IAFA is introduced to capture features based on spatial artifacts and
temporal inconsistencies, termed as FST . At last, a dynamic fusion strategy combines FM and FST
for the final forgery prediction.

Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) LMMs possess generalizable problem-solving abilities in
real-world tasks, including object detection[14], semantic segmentation[67] and visual question
answering[59]. [2, 23, 27, 28] studied feature alignment schemes to bridge visual and textual
domains for LMMs. [68, 72, 71] extended the boundaries of LMMs to multi-modal downstream
tasks. [45] aligns multi-modal features for capabilities on cross-domain behaviors. [58] developed a
Large Language Model (LLM)-based feature extractor for cheap-fake detection. Inspired by these
studies, we stimulate the powerful perceptual and reasoning ability of an LMM by introducing the
multi-modal feature space in video forgery detection.

Methods

In this section, we introduce the Multi-Modal Detection (MM-Det) framework for diffusion video
detection, as depicted in Fig. 4. More formally, Sec. 3.1 details a Large Multi-modal Model (LMM)
branch that learns a Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR). Then Sec. 3.2 reports a Spatio-
Temporal (ST) branch that utilizes In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) to capture spatial artifacts
and temporal inconsistencies in forged videos. Lastly, a dynamic fusion technique reported in Sec. 3.3
adaptively combines outputs from the LMM branch and ST branch.

3.1
Multi-Modal Forgery Representation

We propose a novel Multi-Modal Forgery Representation (MMFR) from the multi-modal space of
LMMs in LMM branch. This representation utilizes the powerful perceptual and reasoning abilities
of LMMs in the form of instruction-based conversations.

Specifically, LMM branch is built on the top of LLaVA [28], one representative LMM, which has two
key components: a visual encoder (e.g., Dv), instantiated by visual encoders from the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) [39], and the large language model DL (i.e., Llama 2 [50]).
Let us denote the input video as X ∈RN×H×W ×C that contains N frames, where each frame is
represented as x ∈RH×W ×C. First, x is fed to Dv to obtain the corresponding visual representation
FV ∈RZ. Such FV not only contains rich semantics but also shows impressive generalization ability
and robustness in the forgery detection task [36, 43, 9]. Then, a textual instruction T is sampled from

Figure 5: (a) In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA): Each input frame (or its feature map) is divided
into patches that are transformed into tokens, termed P-tokens (
). We introduce additional frame-
centric tokens FC-tokens (
) encapsulating the global forgery information of the video frame. In
each transformer layer, self-attention is applied alternately among all P-tokens from video frames as
well as among the same frame’s P-tokens and its FC-tokens. (b) The dynamic fusion strategy captures

representations for the fusion.

pre-defined templates Q to guide the LMM on forgery detection reasoning. Both visual representation
FV and instruction T are fed to DL, which generates enhanced visual representations (e.g., FL).
We convert FV into a sequence of visual tokens [28] (i.e., Hv = {hv,m}M
m=1 ∈RM×D), and T is
transformed into textual tokens Ht = {ht,o}O
o=1 ∈RO×D. Both Hv and Ht are taken as the input
to DL, generating FL ∈RS×D that can be tokenized into the language response providing reasoning
(Fig. 2) about the authenticity of the input x. This procedure is formulated as

FL = DL(Ht, Hv) = DL(T, FV ),
(1)

where T guides the pre-trained DL in comprehending visual content (i.e., FV ), discerning the
subset information from FV . This instruction T enables LMM branch to obtain the multi-modal
representation that leverages the generalization ability from the pre-trained large language model
Llama 2 (i.e., DL), being different to prior work [36, 9] that only relies on FE.

Lastly, we retrieve the final MMFR, denoted as FM ∈RM×Z, by concatenating FV and FL after a
linear layer(i.e., PROJ), as

FM = CONCAT({PROJ(FV ), PROJ(FL)}).

3.2
Capturing Spatial-Temporal Forgery Traces

Targeting capturing spatiotemporal artifacts in video tasks, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal (ST)
branch that learns effective diffusion forgery representation at the video level. Through a reconstruc-
tion procedure, we amplify the diffusion traces in the frequency domain, which is then captured by
In-and-Across Frame Attention (IAFA) to form an effective video-level feature.

Amplification of Diffusion Traces Similar to prior studies [55, 33] that discovered specific
generative traces of diffusion models through reconstruction on diffusion-generated images, we
utilize an Autoencoder to amplify diffusion traces in videos. The reconstruction procedure can be
expressed as follows.

More formally, denote the input video as X ∈RN×H×W ×C that contains N frames, in which each
frame is represented as x ∈RH×W ×C. We leverage a VQ-VAE [51] to obtain the reconstructed
version of x, which is denoted as ˆx ∈RH×W ×C. The difference between x and ˆx makes an effective
indicator of showing if the input is generated by diffusion models, as depicted in Fig. 3. Therefore,
we jointly proceed x and ˆx to the following proposed modules for learning an effective representation
of discerning forgeries.

It is worth mentioning that the prior approach [55] also adopts the idea of using the residual difference
between original and reconstructed inputs to help forgery detection, but the reconstruction method
requires multiple time-step denoising operations, which are computationally infeasible to reconstruct
all frames from X. In contrast, our VQ-VAE-based reconstruction method only requires one single
forward propagation to obtain reconstructed frame ˆx, meanwhile preserving the effectiveness in
indicating the discrepancy between real and fake inputs.

Integration of Spatial and Temporal Information Same as the previous work [3, 35] that utilizes
ViT to learn video-level information, we transform each input video frame (i.e., x) into L tokens, and
propose IAFA for information aggregation, as depicted in Fig. 5a. Let us denote frame-level tokens as
Patch-wise tokens (P-tokens), as they represent local information of one patch from x. More formally,
the ith frame, xi is divided into L patches, and all patches are projected into Ti = {tj
i}L
j=1 ∈RL×D,
where D represents the dimension of each P-token. Also, to capture the global forgery information
for each video frame, we introduce additional tokens called Frame-Centric tokens (FC-tokens). The
FC-token is denoted as pi ∈RD for frame xi and attends other tokens within the same frame xi.

During the forward propagation, we conduct IAFA based on a Transformer, with each block containing
two self-attentions and consecutively modeling the local and global forgeries at each video frame.
Specifically, the first self-attention captures dependencies among P-tokens that restore local forgery
clues. This is formulated by Eq. 3 that tj
i ∈RD attends the token tp
q ∈RD that represents pth
token from qth frame xq. Consequently, given the ith frame i.e., xi, the second self-attention is
conducted among the FC-token (i.e., {pi}) and P-tokens (i.e., {t0
i , t1
i , ... tL−1
i
}) from the same
frame, which encapsulates patch-wise forgery information into the global one for learning the more
robust representation. We formulate this procedure in Eq. 4.

3.3
Dynamic Fusion

We devise the dynamic fusion strategy (i.e., Df) that combines spatiotemporal information from
ST branch and MMFR (i.e., Ff and Fm) for the final prediction, by adjusting their contributions
based on forgeries from the input. More formally, Df (Fig. 5b) learns channel-wise dependencies
among forgery representations (e.g., FST and FM) via the attention mechanism, generating w ∈
RN+M as the output. This procedure can be expressed as w = Df(CONCAT{FST , FM}). Also,
w contains wST ∈RN and wM ∈RM, representing learned channel-wise weights for FST
and FM, respectively. Such channel-wise weights are important in the fusion purpose, as they
help emphasize useful information — we use wST and wM to refine forgery representations as
F′
ST = FST wST and F′
M = FMwM. Lastly, F′
ST and F′
M are concatenated into the fused
representation F0 ∈R(M+N)×D, which is used for the final scalar prediction s via the average
pooling (i.e., AVG) and linear layers(i.e., PROJ):

s = PROJ(AVG(F0)) = PROJ(AVG(CONCAT{F′
ST , F′
M}).

Diffusion, Stable Video, Sora, Pika), forgery videos are collected from official websites and social
media. In total, we collect 3, 938 fake videos and 2, 750 real videos in DVF. As shown in Fig. 7 b
and 7 c, our dataset contains multiple resolutions and durations. The video number of each dataset
varies from 0.1k to 2.8k, with the corresponding frame numbers from 4.2k to 784k. More details

Training Strategy

This section details our two-stage training strategy, in which we first finetune the LMM branch via
instruction tuning [28] and then optimize the entire framework in an end-to-end manner.

LMM Branch Instruction Tuning
We first adapt LLaVA [28] to the forgery detection downstream
task based on instruction tuning, an empirically effective way for various downstream tasks, which
leverages LoRA [21] to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models(LLMs). For that,
construct a large image-text paired dataset, named Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset. Please refer to
Appendix A.3.2 for more details. We use multi-turn conversations to fine-tune the LMM, enhancing
its ability to identify and judge the authenticity of input images. Following the instruction tuning
strategy of LLaVA [28], we only fine-tune the projection layers and LLM in LLaVA. More formally,
we formulate the objective function as the loss for an auto-regressive model, which is based on answer
tokens from the LLM, as:

L(θ1) = −

T
X

t=1
log(pθ1(st|si<t)),
(6)

where si refers to the ith prediction token, T refers to the length of total prediction tokens, and θ1
refers to the trainable parameters in the LMM.

End-to-End Training
After fine-tuning LLaVA, we use this model to form LMM branch of MM-
Det, and then the entire model is trained in an end-to-end manner. Please note that all parameters in
LMM branch are frozen to ensure the optimal multi-modal representation can be obtained. More
formally, we denote MM-Det’s final prediction scalar and the ground truth as s and y, respectively,
and the model is optimized by the cross-entropy loss L as follows:

L(θ2) = −(y log D(v) + (1 −y) log(1 −D(v))
(7)

where θ2 refers to trainable parameters in both ST branch and dynamic fusion modules.

Setup

In the experiment, we use the proposed DVF for the evaluation. In training, 1, 000 videos from
YouTube and 1, 800 fake videos generated by Stable Video Diffusion serve as the training set, in
which 80% are used for training and the remaining 20% for validation. Real videos from Internvid-
10M [54] and fake videos from 6 generative methods are used as testing samples. More details on
training and testing are provided in Appendix A.4.

For a fair comparison, we choose the following 10 recent detection methods as baselines. CN-
NDet [53] applies a ResNet [20] as the backbone for forgery detection. F3Net [38] utilizes frequency
traces left in forgery content. HiFi-Net [18] devise a specific hierarchical fine-grained learning
scheme to learn a wide range of forgery traces. Clip-Raising [9], Uni-FD [36] takes advantage of
a pre-trained CLIP [39] as a training-free feature space. DIRE [55] detects diffusion images based
on a reconstruction process of DDIM [44]. ViViT [3], TALL [62], and TS2-Net [31] take advantage
of spatiotemporal information in various visual tasks. DE-FAKE [43] adopts visual and textual
representations based on a CLIP encoder for image forgery detection. For the measurement, we
choose AUC since it is a threshold-independent metric.

6.2
Video Forgery Detection Performance

In Tab. 1, our proposed MM-Det achieves SoTA performance in detecting diffusion video, surpassing
the second-best method, i.e., HiFi-Net, by 6.7% in AUC scores. Specifically, for prior methods that are
based on pre-trained CLIP features, such as Raising [8] and Universal FD [36], they remain effective
on certain types of diffusion content (i.e., Sora, Pika, Stable Diffusion), but fail on most others.
Simple structures like CNN [53] exceed these CLIP-based methods after being fine-tuned on our
proposed DVF, which proves the necessity of such datasets. As for our method, MM-Det outperforms
other methods in most datasets. Compared with frequency-based forgery methods, e.g., F3Net [38]
and CLIP-based methods [8, 36], our method improves the performance from +0.7%(VideoCrafter1)
to +6.3%(Sora). It is worth mentioning that HiFi-Net makes the second-best performer in our DVF
dataset, achieving 89.0% AUC scores. We believe this indicates the multi-branch feature extractor
used in HiFi-Net carries versatile forgery traces at multiple resolutions, enhancing the learning of
the forgery invariant. The failure of frequency traces and CLIP features raises the need for more
effective features. As for spatiotemporal baselines [3, 62, 31], we outperform them by +7.6%(ViViT),
+24.1%(TALL) and +23.0%(TS2-Net), demonstrating the effective features of MMFR and IAFA.
At last, our detector improves by 22.6% to another multi-modal detector [57], which utilizes visual
information and corresponding captions for feature enhancement. It is shown that the introduction of
MMFR is more generalizable than a simple combination of visual features and text descriptions in
that the powerful perceptual and reasoning abilities of LMMs play a crucial role in discriminating
between real and fake content.

Ablation Study

Tab. 2 shows the impact of individual modules proposed in MM-Det. Specifically, we use the Hybrid
ViT [11] as the base model and incorporate it with the reconstruction procedure for diffusion trace
amplification, which enhances the detection performance by +1.1% AUC score. Such a module
raises the performance in OpenSora and Sora, revealing that frequency-based information benefits
forgery detection on these methods. Detection performance is further increased by using IAFA, which
strengthens the learning between in-frame and cross-frame information, increasing a +13.0% AUC
score to the base model. The rise in performance indicates such temporal information benefits most
types of forgery video detection. After that, Tab. 2’s line 4 indicates the effectiveness of MMFR:
a detector purely based on such representation can receive 90.5% performance in AUC, +14.0%
higher than the base model. In addition, by merging MMFR (i.e., LMM branch) and ST branch,
the performance rises by +3.2%. Finally, with the dynamic fusion strategy, our method receives an
impressive 95.7% AUC score for all generative methods, higher than every single feature. These
experiments highlight the necessities of each module in our framework. Moreover, an ablation study
on LLMs is detailed in Appendix A.5 to prove the effectiveness of various LLMs in MM-Det.

6.4
Spatio Temporal Information Anaylsis

In the analysis of IAFA, we visualize feature activation maps from the last layer of ViT in the
ST branch based on the L2-norm. We compare our feature maps with another spatiotemporal
baseline, ViViT [3], as depicted in Fig. 8. While attention maps of ViViT are sparse and irregular,
the ones of our IAFA have a tendency to concentrate on the segmentation of diffusion-generated
objects, indicating that IAFA captures typical spatial forgery regions in frames. The attention mainly
focuses on common forgery traces, such as blurred generative patterns and defective parts of objects,
signaling that diffusion models might find it difficult to generate delicate content. The concentration
of activation on certain informative objects discloses both spatial artifacts of existing generative
methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed ST branch.

Multimodal Forgery Representation Analysis

Fig. 9 details the effectiveness of MMFR in LMM branch. First, as depicted in Fig. 9 a, we quantify
the detection ability of features from each Transformer-based decoder layer in the LLM. Specifically,
we evaluate both pre-trained LLaVA [28] and its fine-tuned version on the task of distinguishing real
and fake frames. These frames are randomly sampled from 1, 000 real videos and equivalent fake
ones from Stable Video Diffusion [42]. Layer-wise outputs from the large language model in LLaVA
(i.e., Vicuna [50]) are obtained — for i th layer in the LLM, we denote its output features as f o
i ,
i ∈[1, 33]. The K-Means clustering algorithm is adopted to evaluate the classification accuracy based
on f o
i . Empirically, we observe that features extracted from a fine-tuned LLaVA show promising
classification accuracy in the last few layers, e.g., 22-nd or later layers. This phenomenon indicates
that specific layers in LLMs indeed generate features that can be used for image forensic tasks. Such
features are utilized in MMFR to exhibit high generalization ability towards diverse and unseen
forgeries. Secondly, the comparison between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLaVA highlights the
importance of downstream task-oriented instruction tuning for LMMs. This conclusion is consistent
with the findings of prior works [27, 28, 69, 68].

In addition, shown in Fig. 9 b and 9 c, we analyze features from ST branch and LMM branch through
t-SNE [52]. Both features achieve superior performance in separating real and forgery videos. In
Fig. 9 b, spatiotemporal information forms a rough boundary between real and fake videos. This
feature is effective for VideoCrafter1 [5], Zeroscope, Stable Video, and Pika, whose durations and
resolutions are similar to the training set. However, the detection performance might decrease on
Sora and OpenSora with overlay in the clusters. We suppose that various resolutions and durations
may compromise the generalization ability, magnifying the importance of a comprehensive dataset
for these videos. Fig. 9 c demonstrates the more powerful feature from LMM branch. Samples from
Zeroscope, Sora, and Pika are compacted into a denser area, indicating the ability of LLMs to conduct
generalizable reasoning. Such features provide new insights for detection when spatial and temporal
artifacts are not obvious among the latest forgery videos.

Conclusion

In this work, we develop an effective video-level algorithm termed Multi-Modal Detection (MM-Det)
for diffusion-generated video detection. MM-Det leverages a novel generalizable Multi-Modal
Forgery Representation (MMFR) that is obtained from multi-modal spaces in LMMs. Specifically,
the proposed MM-Det has two major branches: the LMM branch, which incorporates vision and
text features from the fine-tuned foundation model, and the ST branch, which concentrates on
modeling spatial-temporal information aggregated through In-and-Across Frame Attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed detector. In addition, we establish a
comprehensive dataset for various diffusion generative videos, which we hope will serve as a general
benchmark for real-world video forensic tasks.

Appendix / Supplemental Material

A.1
Limitations

Although our proposed MM-Det advances in detecting fake videos, further issues are left to handle.
First, as the landscape of video manipulation technology evolves, new techniques and tools will
outpace existing detection methods. The gap between training data and real-world applications can
lead to misleading results. Currently, our method is limited to fully synthesized diffusion videos,
lacking the generalization to more delicate forgeries like partial manipulation. A possible reason is
that small forgery traces disappear after multiple downsampling operations in the deep network of
LMMs. Besides, the integration of a large language model into detection costs huge computational
complexity, which is not an optimal choice for an environment with limited resources.

In conclusion, while our algorithm makes a critical step forward in detecting fake videos, it faces
significant challenges due to the rapid advancement of video manipulation technologies. Addressing
these limitations requires further research to keep pace with the evolving techniques in digital content
manipulation.

A.2
Broader Impacts

In this work, our team has developed an effective algorithm to detect fake videos, a breakthrough that
promises to fortify the authenticity of online media. In real-world social media where misinformation
can spread rapidly, our method acts as a crucial safeguard by empowering platforms to flag and
remove deceptive videos before they can mislead users. However, our methods may fail in extreme
situations, such as blurred images or noisy images. The algorithm should be carefully treated to
avoid misleading results. The long-term influence of our work protects public trust by ensuring the
authenticity of digital content. Meanwhile, precaution is needed for a fair application.

A.3
Datasets

A.3.1
Diffusion Video Forensics

We propose a comprehensive dataset, named Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF), for diffusion video
forensics, as shown in Tab. S1. DVF consists of fake videos generated from 8 different generation
methods, covering text-to-video and image-to-video generative methods. In total, We make a
collection of 2, 750 real videos and 3, 938 fake videos. Real videos are from YouTube and Internvid-
10M [54].

We formally introduce the generation pipeline for video collection. Generation methods in DVF are
divided into closed-sourced methods and open-sourced methods. For closed-sourced methods(Sora,
Pika, Stable Diffusion [42] and Stable Video), we collect video samples from official websites
and social media like TikTok to form the forgery video datasets. For open-sourced methods, the
generation pipelines are divided into text-to-video (OpenSora, VideoCrafter1 [5] and Zeroscope)
and image-to-video (Stable Video Diffusion [4]). For a text-to-video generative method, real data
derives from a text-image paired video dataset, Internvid-10M. Specifically, we fetch paired real
videos R = {r1, r2, ..., rN} and corresponding captions C = {c1, c2, ..., cN}. We directly apply the

Figure S1: The overview of Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset. To obtain text-image paired data on
forgery reasoning, we take advantage of the powerful reasoning ability of Gemini [48] to generate
ground truth for each image. First, an instruction T is sampled from a template, along with a frame
f ∈RH×W ×C fed into Gemini for forgery analysis and detection. The response r contains detailed
judgment and reasoning on the content and authenticity of f(e.g., analyses on color and depth).
Finally, f and r are collected as the text-image paired data to form Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset.

captions as prompts to generate fake video datasets F, such that F = {f1, f2, ...fN}, fi = gt(ci), i ∈
[1, N], where gt denotes a text-to-video method. Both R and F are included in DVF as real and fake
datasets. For image-to-video methods, real videos come from Youtube-8M [1], which are denoted
as R = {r1, r2, ..., rN}, ri ∈RL×H×W ×C. For each video ri, a real frame xi ∈RH×W ×C is
randomly sampled from ri and serves as the conditional input for generation. The fake datasets
are obtained as F = {f1, f2, ...fN}, fi = gim(ri), i ∈[1, N], where gim denotes an image-to-video
method.

A.3.2
Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset

We construct a text-image paired dataset, called Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset (RFRD), to support
instruction-tuning LMMs on the forgery detection task, as shown in Fig. S1. We start from the
YouTube and Stable Video Diffusion dataset in DVF, where we select 1, 000 real videos and 1, 800
fake videos. Depending on the powerful reasoning ability of Gemini [48] v1.5 Pro, we follow the
scheme in Fig. S1 to generate ground truth for frames. In total, 1, 921 real frames and 3, 579 fake
frames are sampled to generate 5, 500 image-text paired textual descriptions. These descriptions are
then cleaned and converted into 38k multi-turn conversations for fine-tuning LLaVA [28] in LMM
branch of MM-Det.

A.4
Implementation Details

Hyperparameters of MM-Det
We introduce the implementation of our MM-Det. In ST branch,
we employ a Hybrid-ViT [11] to build the video-level feature encoder. We choose Hybrid-ViT-B,
with a ViT-B/16 on top of a ResNet-50 backbone, the patch size 14 × 14, and the hidden size 768.
We employ IAFA in each attention block of the ViT, with FC-tokens initialized as the class token of
ViT. In the embedding stage, learnable spatial and temporal embeddings are introduced in the form
of addition. All patches at the same position within frames share the same spatial embedding and
patches with the same timestep share the same time embedding. A pre-trained VQ-VAE is applied to
reconstruct videos, with hidden size d = 256 and the codebook size K = 512. We train the VQ-VAE
on 50, 000 images from ImageNet. In LMM branch, we utilize LLaVA [28] v1.5, with a CLIP [39]
encoder E of CLIP-ViT-L-patch14-336 and a large language model D of Vicuna-7b for reasoning.
Our proposed MMFR is composed of the pooler output FV ∈R1024 from the last layer of E and the
embedding of output FL from the last layer of D. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we fix the
length of output tokens into 64 and obtain FL ∈R64×4096.

Training and Inference
As for the experimental resources in training and inference, we conduct
all experiments using a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU and a maximum of 200G memory.

The training strategy of MM-Det is in two-stage. We first conduct instruction tuning for LLaVA in
the LMM branch based on LoRA [21]. We start from a pre-trained LLaVA v1.5 and train it on our
collected Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset detailed in Sec. A.3.2. We use an Adam optimizer with
the learning rate set as 2e−5 for 10 epochs. After that, we integrate LLaVA into MM-Det and conduct
the overall training. The training set is split into 8 : 2 for training and validation data. For each video,

successive 10 frames are randomly sampled and cropped into 224 × 224 as the input. We use an
Adam optimizer with the learning rate set as 1e−4 for training until the model converges.

For inference, we evaluate all models at the video level. For frame-level baselines, the score of an
entire video is obtained as the average score of all frames. For video-level methods, successive clips
are fed according to the corresponding window size, and the entire score is obtained as the average
score of all clips. In addition, to leverage the efficiency for inference, MM-Det first caches MMFR
for each video by conducting reasoning at the interval of 1 frame every 6 seconds. During inference,
each video clip directly applies MMFR from the nearest cached frame as an approximation to reduce
the huge computational cost.

A.5
Ablation Study on LLMs

We adopt alternative LLMs in our MM-Det to evaluate different choices of language backbones.
Performance is reported in Tab. S2. More formally, for a fair comparison, when using different LLMs,
we maintain other components e.g., CLIP, the reconstruction procedure, IAFA, and the dynamic
fusion of the original MM-Det remained. Specifically, the introduction of a combined vision and
text space from Vicuna-7b in LLaVA improves the performance by +5.1%. As for the choice of
LMMs, Vicuna-7b achieves a total 95.7% performance, +1.2% higher than Mistral-7b. We suppose
this result may be attributed to different attention mechanisms in Vicuna and Mistral. Vicuna-13b
gains a further improvement by +0.6% due to incremental parameters in capturing more effective
multi-modal feature spaces. These results prove that our MMFR is effective and extensible to other
language models.

A.6
Robustness Analysis

To analyze the robustness of our method, we conduct an additional evaluation of MM-Det based on
common post-processing operations. We choose Gaussian blur with σ = 3, JPEG compression with
quality Q = 90, resize with a ratio of 0.7, rotation with an angle of 90, and a mixture of all operations
as unseen perturbations in real-world scenarios. Testing samples are selected from DVF to form a
total of 500 real videos and 500 fake videos. As reported in Tab. S3, MM-Det meets a degradation
of 2.5%(JPEG Compression) to 6.5%(Gaussian blur), with all performance above 89%. The results
indicate the effectiveness of our method under these operations.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main claims fit with the paper’s contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper discusses the limitations of the work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: For each theoretical result, the paper provides the full set of assumptions and a
complete and correct proof.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper fully discloses all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

19


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Although no link is available for our work now, we are strongly intended to
share our work in public when the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper specifies all the training and test details
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

20


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper discusses both positive and negative social impacts in Boarder
Impacts.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

21


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper has no risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All creators and owners of assets are properly credited, and the license and
terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly are respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

22


---Page Break---

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: New assets introduced in the paper are well documented, with the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing and research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper does not involve study participants.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
