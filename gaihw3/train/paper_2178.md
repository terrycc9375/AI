Abstract

Recent 3D large reconstruction models (LRMs) can generate high-quality 3D
content in sub-seconds by integrating multi-view diffusion models with scalable
multi-view reconstructors. Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. How-
ever, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from
multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise
of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet compu-
tationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we
introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model
featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space
Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing
multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long

the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation
tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content
generation scenarios with approximately only 0.1× of the model size. The codes

Introduction

We address the challenge of crafting 3D content from a single image, sparse-view images, or text
input, which can facilitate a broad range of applications, e.g., Virtual Reality, immersive filming,
digital gaming and animation. Previous research on 3D generation has investigated distilling 2D
diffusion priors into 3D representations via score distillation sampling (SDS) [1]. Although these
optimization-based approaches exhibit strong zero-shot generation capability with high-fidelity
rendering quality [2–5], they are extremely time- and memory-intensive, often requiring hours to
produce a single 3D asset, thus not practical for a real-world scenario.

With the advent of large-scale open-world 3D datasets [6–8], recent 3D large reconstruction models
(LRMs) [9–12] integrate multi-view diffusion models [13–15] with scalable multi-view 3D recon-
structor to regress a certain 3D representation (e.g. Triplane-NeRF [16, 17], mesh) in a feed-forward
manner. Specifically, current LRMs [18–20] adopt a one image (or text) →mulit-view images →3D
diagram to predict 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [21] parameters, thereby ensuring the rendering
efficiency while preserving fine details. Given a single image or text prompt, they first generate a set
of images using multi-view diffusion models, which are then fed into a multi-view reconstructor (e.g.,
U-Net [22] or Transformer [23]), mapping image tokens to 3D Gaussians with superior generation
speed and unprecedented quality.

However, we observe that existing feed-forward Gaussian reconstruction models typically adopt
powerful yet computationally intensive architectures [23, 24] to generate long sequences of Gaussians
for intricate 3D modeling. Such approaches inevitably compromise the integrity of multi-view infor-
mation propagation to manage computational costs. For instance, they use local [18] or mixed [19]
attention on limited multi-view image tokens or even deal each view separately and simply merge
the predicted Gaussians afterwards [20]. Consequently, the generated 3D models often suffer from
multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). These issues indicate
that current compromise strategies fail to translate into coherent, high-quality outputs in practice.
This raises a crucial question: How can we preserve the integrity of multi-view information while
efficiently generating a sufficiently long sequence of Gaussians?

To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce Multi-View Gaussian Mamba (MVGamba), a
general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model. At its core, MVGamba features a multi-view
Gaussian reconstructor based on the recently introduced RNN-like architecture Mamba [25], which
expands the given multi-view images into a long sequence of 3D Gaussian tokens and processes them
recurrently in a causal manner. By adopting causal context propagation, our approach efficiently
maintains multi-view information integrity and further enables cross-view self-refinement from earlier
to current views. Additionally, our Gaussian reconstructor enables the fine-detailed generation of
long Gaussian sequences with linear complexity [26, 27] in a single forward process, eliminating the
need for any post hoc operations used in previous work.

More concretely, we first patchify the multi-view images into N tokens and rearrange them according
to a cross-scan order [27, 28], resulting in 4×N image tokens for selective scanning. These tokens are
then processed through a series of Mamba blocks for state space sequence modeling. Subsequently,
we feed the output Gaussian sequence into a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for channel-
wise knowledge selection, followed by a set of linear decoders to obtain the Gaussian parameters
representing high-quality 3D content (Sec. 3.2). Compared to previous LRMs [11, 29, 30], our
MVGamba features many computationally efficient components: a single-layer 2D convolution image
tokenizer replaces the pre-trained DINO [31] transformer encoder, a lightweight MLP combined with
linear decoders replaces the deep MLP decoder, and most importantly, linear complexity Mamba
blocks replace quadratic complexity Transformer blocks (Figure 2(b)). Together, these designs ensure
efficient training and inference while achieving higher generation quality (Sec. 4). Moreover, to

incorporate a 3DGS variant — 2DGS [32] — for accurate geometric modeling and mesh extraction.

We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to verify the efficacy of our
proposed MVGamba. The experimental results demonstrate that MVGamba (49M parameters)
outperforms other latest LRMs [19, 29, 33] and even optimization-based methods [34, 35] on the task
of text-to-3D generation, single-view reconstruction and sparse-view reconstruction with roughly
only 0.1× of the model size. The contributions and novelties of our paper are summarized as follows:

• We point out that directly generating a sufficiently long sequence of Gaussians with full multi-view
information is crucial for consistent and fine-detailed 3D generation.

• We introduce MVGamba, a novel feed-forward pipeline that incorporates causal context propagation
for cross-view self-refinement, allowing the efficient generation of long sequences of 2D/3D
Gaussians for high-quality 3D content modeling.

• Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba is a potentially general solution for 3D content
generation, including text-to-3D, image-to-3D and sparse-view reconstruction task.

Related Work

3D Generation. Previous approaches for generating high-fidelity 3D models predominantly used
SDS-based optimization techniques [1, 36] and their variants [2–5, 34, 37]. These methods yield
high-quality 3D generations but require hours for the per-instance optimization process to converge.
Pioneered by the large reconstruction model (LRM) [29], recent works [10, 11, 30, 38] show that
image tokens can be directly mapped to 3D representations, typically triplane-NeRF, in a feed-
forward manner via a scalable transformer-based architecture [23] with large-scale 3D training
data [6–8]. Among them, Instant3D [11] integrates LRM with multi-view image diffusion models [13–
15, 39, 40], using four generated images for better quality. To avoid inefficient volume rendering
and limited triplane resolution, some concurrent works [18–20] follow Instant3D and introduce 3D
Gaussian Splatting [21] into sparse-view LRM variants. Specifically, GRM [18] and GS-LRM [20]
use pixel-aligned Gaussian with a pure transformer-based reconstruction model, increasing the
number of Gaussians through image feature upsampling and per-pixel merge operations. LGM [19]
combines the 3D Gaussians from different views using a convolution-based asymmetric U-Net [22].
Our MVGamba, on the other hand, directly processes multi-view conditions causally, recurrently
generating a long sequence of Gaussians for coherent and high-fidelity 3D modeling.

Mamba model for visual applications. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs) [17,
41, 42], notably Mamba [25], have gained prominence in long sequence modeling for harmoniz-
ing computational efficiency and model versatility [43–46]. Following Mamba’s progress, there
has been a surge in applying this framework to critical vision domains, including generic vision
backbones [26, 27, 47, 48], multi-modal streams [49, 50], and vertical applications, especially in
medical image processing [51–56]. Specifically, VMamba [27] pioneers a purely Mamba-based
backbone to handle intensive prediction tasks. Similarly, Vim [26] leverages bidirectional SSMs
for data-dependent global visual context without image-specific biases. Subsequent works progress
with advanced selective scanning algorithms [47, 48], integration with other networks [57, 58], and

single-view reconstruction with limited texture quality and generalization capacity. In this paper, we
explore and demonstrate the efficiency and long-sequence modeling capacity of Mamba in various
3D generation tasks with large-scale pre-training.

Method

In this section, we present our MVGamba, designed to efficiently generate 3D content through a
two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we utilize off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models, including
MVDream [14] and ImageDream [13], to generate multi-view images based on an input text prompt
or a single image. In the second stage, equipped with this multi-view image generator, we introduce
an SSM-based multi-view reconstructor to generate Gaussians from multi-view images. Specifically,
we first provide a brief overview of 3D Gaussian splatting and its variants (Sec. 3.1). Next, we
describe the core architecture of our multi-view Gaussian reconstructor (Sec. 3.2), followed by
detailed elaboration of our robust training objectives (Sec. 3.3). With above large-scale pre-training,
we are able to chain these two stages to produce high-fidelity 3D content in seconds (Sec. 3.4).

3.1
Preliminary: Gaussian Splatting

Introduced by [21], vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) fits a 3D scene from multi-view images
with a collection of 3D Gaussians. Variants of Gaussian Splatting [62, 63], typically 2DGS, leverage
2D Gaussian primitives instead, excelling in the vanilla version for more accurate geometry recon-
struction. Generally, each Gaussian is composed of its 3D center µ ∈R3, 3D scale s ∈R3 or 2D
scale * s ∈R2, associated color c ∈R3, opacity α ∈R, and a rotation quaternion q ∈R4. These
parameters can be collectively denoted by G, with Gi = {µi, si, ci, αi, qi} denoting the parameter of
the i-th Gaussian. These Gaussians can then be splatted onto the image plane and rendered in real
time via the differentiable tiled rasterizer [21, 62].

3.2
SSM-based Gaussian reconstructor

The core of MVGamba is a feed-forward multi-view Gaussian reconstructor. As depicted in Fig-
ure 3(a), our reconstructor transforms multi-view input images with camera embedding [64] into 3D
contents represented by 3D Gaussians [21] or its variants [62, 63] in a feed-forward manner. This
reconstructor comprises an SSM-based processor to expand and process multi-view image tokens as
Gaussian sequences, and a light-weight Gaussian decoder to predict attributes for each Gaussian.

*2DGS collapses the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks to model surfaces intrinsically.

Expanding multi-view images as sequences.
Given a posed multi-view image set {vi, πi}, we
first densely embed the camera pose πi ∈R4×4 for each view vi ∈RH×W ×3 using Plücker rays [30],
denoted as Pi ∈RH×W ×6. The pixel values and ray embeddings are concatenated into a 9-channel
fused map, which is then tokenized using a non-overlapping convolution with a kernel size of p × p:

Vi = Conv(Concat(vi, Pi)),
(1)

where Vi ∈Rh×w×C is the tokenized feature map; h = H/p, w = W/p; C is the embedding
dimension. Note that considering the light-weight architectural design, our image tokenizer is
much simpler than the pre-trained DINO [31] utilized by previous LRMs, which we empirically
find to be redundant for low-level 3D reconstruction. With the tokenized multi-view features, we
then adopt a cross-scan order [27] to rearrange them as sequence. Specifically, we scan the image
tokens sequentially along four different directions: top-left →bottom-right, bottom-right
→top-left, top-right →bottom-left, and bottom-left →top-right, which allows each
token to integrate information from all adjacent tokens. This cross-scan rearrangement results in a
sequence that is 4× longer:
X = Pscan(Concat({Vi})),
(2)
where X ∈R4Nhw×C denotes the expanded Gaussian sequences, N denotes the view number, and
Pscan denotes the cross-scan operation on each view.

Causal sequence modeling with State Space Model.
Inspired by [25, 61], we model the Gaussian
sequences via an adapted SSM-based processor. In detail, given the expanded Gaussian sequence X,
we first add a learnable positional embedding E element-wise to it and derive the initial Gaussian
sequence X0. Then, we feed X0 into L stacked SSM layers for recurrent causal sequence modeling,
formulated as:
Xk = SSMk(Xk−1; Ak, Bk, ∆k)
(3)
where Xk denotes Gaussian sequence output by the k-th layer, and SSMk denotes the k-th SSM layer
with vanilla Mamba [25] structure; Ak, Bk and ∆k are parameters of SSM layer dependent on the
input sequence Xk−1. Note that we are modeling Gaussian sequences rather than integrating spatial
information as in existing vision Mamba models [26, 27, 47]. Therefore, we adopt 1D convolution
instead of 2D convolution in the Mamba blocks, similar to other sequential modeling SSMs [25, 58,
65]. Through state space sequence modeling, we successfully propagate the causal context containing
the multi-view information from earlier states to later states with linear complexity. This approach
efficiently incorporates multi-view information causally from the initial condition onward, thereby
making full use of all Gaussian tokens through cross-view self-refinement. As discussed in Sec. 5, this
causal sequential generation of Gaussian tokens provides the model with unprecedented robustness
and self-correction abilities, even under inconsistent or noisy input conditions.

Decoding causal token sequences into Gaussians.
Each token in the processed causal sequence
XL is treated as a separate 3D Gaussian token. We first apply a single hidden layer MLP to XL,
where the width of the hidden layer is 4C and the output channels revert to C. This process is denoted
as Z = MLP(XL), which aims for channel-wise knowledge selection [24, 66, 67]. We then apply
sub-heads to derive each attribute of 3DGS with separate linear projections. Specifically, we predict
the position [61] by discretizing the coordinates where position µi is clamped to [−1, 1]3. The scale
si is predicted with a learnable linear projection followed by a softplus activation. The opacity αi is
predicted with a linear projection followed by sigmoid activation. Regarding the color attribute ci,
we predict the RGB values instead of the spherical harmonics adopted by the original 3DGS[21], as
our reconstructor is mainly trained on synthetic 3D datasets free of light variation.

However, unlike other Gaussian attributes, the rotation quaternions are quite sensitive and difficult to
predict directly, and hence are often set canonical isotropic and fixed in several recent works [61, 68].
On the other hand, some works [19, 33] predict the rotation without any constraints, but this often
causes artifacts and corrupted generations in practice. To address this issue, we design a novel rotation
decoder, dubbed RotNet, which balances prediction flexibility and restriction. Our RotNet consists of
a set of 32 pre-defined rotation quaternions, denoted as T, which forms a canonical rotation space,
and a learnable linear projection matrix Θ to predict the logits of these quaternions. The predicted
logits are then transformed into a probability distribution using the Gumbel-Softmax [69], enabling
differentiation through the discrete selection process by adding noise sampled from the Gumbel
distribution to the logits p ∈R32 before applying the softmax function:

p = softmax(ΘZ + g),
where
gk = −log(−log(uk)),
uk ∼Uniform(0, 1).

In this way, we convert the rotation prediction into a 32-class classification task in a fully differentiable
way, which allows for direct selection via the argmax operation during inference. We refer to
Appendix D for more detailed explanations. These decoded Gaussians are finally passed into the
differentiable rasterization pipeline [21] for image-level supervision.

3.3
Stable Training of MVGamba

Bridging the training-inference gap. In the training phase, multi-view images are collected from
the ground-truth blendering of 3D objects, while they are generated by diffusion models during
inference. To mitigate such domain gap: (1) Following LGM [19], we leverage the grid distortion
and orbital camera jitter as two data augmentations with a 30% probability to simulate inconsistent
pixels and inaccurate camera poses, respectively. (2) We directly use ImageDream [13] as a synthetic
data engine to generate multi-view images input and conduct a joint training with the ground-truth
renderings from the 3D training dataset. In practice, with a 5% chance, we train MVGamba with
synthetic input to mimic the inference pattern for more robust generation results.

Overall training objective. During the training phase, we differentiably render the RGB image vi
and alpha mask vα
i of the N = 4 input views and another six novel views for image-level supervision.
Our final objective then comprises four key terms:

respectively; LLPIPS represents the well-adopted VGG-based perceptual loss [70] ; Lreg is the opacity

density. λmask, LLPIPS and λreg are the trade-off coefficients that balance each loss.

3.4
Unified 3D Generation Inference

During inference (Figure 3(b)), the pre-trained reconstructor can be smoothly combined with any off-
the-shelf multi-view diffusion models to efficiently predict a set of Gaussians, which facilitates both
text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation. Typically, we leverage ImageDream [13] and MVDream [14]
to produce 4 multi-view images with anchored poses [11] from a single image or text prompt,
respectively. For mesh extraction, following Huang et al. [62], we utilize truncated signed distance
fusion (TSDF) [71] that fuse the depth maps rendered from the output Gaussians to obtain a smooth
polygonal mesh.

Experimental Settings

Training dataset. We obtain the multi-view images from Objaverse [7] for MVGamba pre-training.
Following [19, 72], we filtered 80k valid high-quality 3D objects. We then used Blender under
uniform lighting to render 25 views of RGBA images with their alpha masks at a resolution of 512 ×
512, in the elevation range of 5◦to 30◦with rotation {15◦· r|r ∈[0, 23] , r ∈N}. To align with the
camera configurations in ImageDream [13] and MVDream [14], at each training step, we select 4
images of a certain object as input views with the same elevations, while rotations separated by 90◦,
denoted as {ϕ + 90◦· k | k ∈0, 1, 2, 3} and another random set of 6 views as supervision.

Implementation details. MVGamba is trained on 32 NVIDIA A100 (80G) with batch size 512
for about 2 days. We adopt gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training with BF16 data
type to ensure efficient training and inference. We use the AdamW optimizer with learning rate
1 × 10−3 and weight decay 0.05, following a linear learning rate warm-up for 15 epochs with cosine
decay to 1 × 10−5. The output Gaussians are rendered at 512 × 512 resolution for mean square error
loss and resized to 256 × 256 for LPIPS loss for memory efficiency. The trade-off coefficients that
balancing each loss were set as λmask = 1.0, λLPIPS = 0.6 and λreg = 0.001. We also follow the
common practice [19] to clip the gradient with a maximum norm of 1.0. The detail of MVGamba
model configuration is included in Appendix D.

Comparison against Baselines

In this section, we compare MVGamba with previous state-of-the-art instant 3D generation methods
in image-to-3D, text-to-3D generation, and sparse-view reconstruction tasks. For each task, we first
elaborate on the evaluation metrics and baseline methods, then perform an extensive qualitative and
quantitative comparison.

Single image-to-3D generation. We make comparisons to recent methods, including optimization-
based DreamGaussian [34], Wonder3D [73]; feed-forward methods LGM [19], TripoSR [74] and
Triplane-Gaussian [33] and One-2345++ [75]. We adopted the official codebase and pre-trained
model weight for all the above methods and we are quite confident that the baselines presented are the
finest re-implementations we have come across†. We evaluated the generation quality of MVGamba
with a wide range of wild images in Figure 4. We use well-adopted PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS for
quantitative measurement in the GSO [76] dataset following [18], with a total of 16 test views
with equidistant azimuth and −10 ∼10 degree elevations. As illustrated in Figure 4, MVGamba
maintains high fidelity and plausible generation in most scenarios. In contrast, Triplane-Gaussian
severely suffers from flat and blurred views, which is a notoriously ill-posed challenge, as stated by
Instant3D [11]. Moreover, LGM frequently showcases multi-view inconsistency with a transparent
surface, which may be attributed to its suboptimal parameter constraints and merge operation. In

Table 1, MVGamba outperforms other baselines in most evaluation metrics. Note that although our
inference speed (4 seconds) is relatively slower than Triplane-Gaussian, we achieve significantly
better generation quality by a large margin of 2.97 dB PSNR.

Text-to-3D generation. Similar to the single image-to-3D task, we compare MVGamba with several
optimization-based methods and feed-forward models LGM, TripoSR, and Triplane-Gaussian, using
various prompts. For methods that only accept a single image as input, such as TripoSR and Triplane-
Gaussian, we use DALL·E 3 [77] to transform the given text into a single image. Note that for
more fair comparison, MVGamba and LGM take the same generated multi-view inputs. Figure 4
shows that MVGamba excels at generating plausible geometry and highly realistic texture. Due to its
effective ray embedding and multi-view diffusion models, MVGamba is also free from the multi-face
problems that frequently occur in optimization-based methods. We further randomly selected 50
prompts from the Dreamfusion [1] gallery and used CLIP Precision and CLIP scores [78–80] to
measure appearance quality and alignment with the given prompt. Our high generation quality is also
vividly reflected in Table 1, where MVGamba consistently ranks the highest among all baselines.

Sparse-view reconstruction. Given the same sparse-view inputs, we compare MVGamba with
SparseNeuS [81] (trained in One-2-3-45), SparseGS [82] and LGM [19] that are capable of generating
3D Gaussians. We visualize the reconstruction results of MVGamba in Figure 5 and compare against
baselines on the GSO [76] dataset with 32 randomly selected views for each object. As shown in
Figure 2 and Figure 6, MVGamba is able to faithfully reproduce high-frequency details with accurate
geometric modeling. Due to the limited space, the quantitative evaluation is presented in Appendix C.

during inference to test robustness, and the other on the effect of Gaussian sequence length for
sparse-view reconstruction. (1) In Figure 7(a), we manually perturb one of the four input images with
Gaussian noise to simulate the worst-case multi-view input inconsistency caused by the diffusion
model. We then feed these manipulated images into the MVGamba reconstructor and merge-operation
reconstructor for comparison. As expected, generating 3D Gaussians conditioned on each view
separately and simply merging the outputs treats the perturbed input as faithfully as the other views,
resulting in inconsistency and even corrupted results. In contrast, our Gaussian reconstructor generates
the Gaussian sequence in a causal and self-refining manner, allowing it to mitigate the effects of the
perturbation by leveraging propagated multi-view information. This experiment demonstrates that
our MVGamba is highly resilient to inconsistencies in multi-view diffusion models used in the first
stage due to its causal sequence modeling. (2) We also investigate the effect of Gaussian sequence
length by varying the patch size to model different sequence lengths. As shown in Figure 7(b), our
SSM-based Gaussian reconstructor can directly generate extremely long Gaussian sequences, and its
performance improves with increasing sequence length. From these two aspects, we can conclude
that the higher generation performance of MVGamba is indeed attributable to its self-refineable
multi-view modeling and efficient utilization of sufficiently long Gaussian sequences.

Q2: What impacts performance of MVGamba in terms of component-wise contributions?

in performance. In particular, if we replace our designed Gaussian Decoder with the one in previous
LRMs [11, 29] (10-layer, 64-width shared MLP), we notice a large performance drop due to degraded
sequential modeling ability and a tendency for the deep MLP to overfit. Additionally, the lack of
restrictions on position and rotation could cause more artifacts during both training and inference.

Q3: What is the limitation of MVGamba?

A3: Honestly, though MVGamba achieves promising results, it still has several limitations. (1) As
we model the Gaussian sequence causally, MVGamba can sometimes fail if the depth of the front
view is not estimated correctly (Figure 8 top). Fortunately, we empirically find that this limitation
can be mitigated by manually changing the input order. For example, using a side-view as the first
input allows our model to generate satisfactory 3D content, as the side-view contains sufficient depth
information (Figure 8 bottom). In the future, we may explore automatic ways to optimize the input
order to enhance robustness. (2) The generation quality of MVGamba is highly dependent on the
four input views provided by off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models [13, 14]. However, current
multi-view diffusion models are far from perfect, known to exhibit 3D inconsistencies [9, 19, 83],
and limited to a resolution of 256 × 256. We expect that our model’s performance can be seamlessly
boosted with the advancements in multi-view diffusion models in future work.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model
for unified 3D content generation. MVGamba features a novel multi-view Gaussian reconstructor
based on state space sequence modeling, maintaining multi-view information integrity and enabling
cross-view self-refinement. It generates long Gaussian sequences with linear complexity in a single
forward process, eliminating the need for post hoc operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MVGamba (49M parameters) outperforms state-of-the-art LRMs in various 3D generation tasks
with only 0.1× the model size. In general, MVGamba achieves state-of-the-art quality and high
efficiency in parameter utilization, training, inference, and rendering speed. In the future, we aim to
apply MVGamba to a wider range of 3D generation tasks, such as scene and 4D (dynamic) generation.

A
Implementation Details

Inference.
For single image input, MVGamba first segments the recentered foreground object
using a pre-trained segmentation model [84], then leveraging a multi-view diffusion model, typically
ImageDream, to generate four posed views as input for the SSM-reconstructor. Similarly, for text
prompt input, MVGamba uses MVDream to transform the given text into four posed views. For
sparse-view reconstruction, MVGamba takes the given few views as the ground-truth multi-view
inputs. MVGamba employs a default camera pose with both zero elevation and azimuth to produce
camera tokens and Plücker ray inputs. Remarkably, this process requires only about 10 GB of GPU
memory (for both the multi-view diffusion model and the Gaussian Reconstructor) and completes
in less than 5 seconds (4.5 seconds for multi-view image generation and 0.03 second for predicting
Gaussians and real-time rendering) on a single NVIDIA A800 (80G) GPU, making it well-suited for
online deployment scenarios.

Mesh extraction.
For mesh extraction from reconstructed 2D splats, following [32], we render
depth maps of the Gaussian rendering views by using the median depth value of the splats projected
onto the pixels. We then use truncated signed distance fusion (TSDF) with Open3D to fuse the
reconstruction depth maps. We reset the voxel size and the truncation threshold during TSDF fusion
suitable for object mesh extraction.

More Discussion

B.1
Comparison with concurrent works.

We illustrate the two current sequence modeling paradigms for Gaussian LRMs: Compressed vs.
Direct Sequence Modeling (ours) in Figure 9. Below, we elaborate on these two paradigms to
highlight the unique approach of our proposed paradigm compared to recent transformer-based
approaches, e.g., GRM, GS-LRM.

• (a) Compressed Sequence Modeling: This approach tokenizes the input into a compact
representation, processes it through a series of transformer blocks, and then upsamples to
produce the 3DGS parameters. This paradigm is represented by the concurrent GS-LRM
and GRM.
• (b) Direct Sequence Modeling (ours): This approach tokenizes and expands the input into
a sufficiently long sequence of tokens through cross-scan operations, which are then directly
processed by a series of mamba blocks to generate the 3DGS parameters.

Our proposed paradigm (b) offers several significant benefits:

• Efficient long sequence modeling: It accommodates larger spatial dimensions to cap-
ture and preserve fine-grained details while mitigating information loss typically caused
by upsamplers, such as the zero-padding in de-convolution layers. This benefits accu-
rate geometry and texture reconstruction. As demonstrated in Table 3, Mamba’s linear
computational complexity allows for a favorable balance between computational cost and
long-sequence modeling capacity, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution inputs
without prohibitive memory requirements.

• Easy of optimization: It directly models the 3DGS sequence without any upsampler, hence
establishing a more straightforward relationship between 3DGS parameters (e.g., position,
color) and the modeled sequence. This eases the non-convex optimization in inverse graphics
scenario, as discussed in PixelSplat, and helps learn accurate geometry and textures.
• Cross-view self-refinement: It efficiently incorporates multi-view information causally
from the initial condition onward, thereby enabling the refinement of inconsistent parts
based on earlier views and generated tokens.

B.2
The function of pixel-aligned Gaussian

We conducted an additional experiment using a non-pixel-aligned transformer model for 3DGS
prediction. As discussed in Appendix B.1, transformer-based methods typically process a compressed
sequence considering the computational budget. We then followed OpenLRM to model 4096 tokens,
and adopt a de-convolution layer to up-sample the 3DGS tokens from 4096 to 16384, similar to
TGS for intricate 3D modeling. However, as shown in Figure 11, the non-pixel-aligned transformer
yielded inferior performance, with broken geometry and extremely blurred textures after 300 epochs
of training. We attribute this to the inherent non-convex optimization challenge in the inverse graphics
scenario, as mentioned in pixelSplat [85], which may be further amplified by the upsampler. This
preliminary result may also explain why pixel-aligned approaches are proposed and are adopted
by recent transformer-based approaches with upsamplers. On the other hand, our proposed direct
sequence modeling paradigm allows for more fine-grained detail modeling and exhibits a cross-view
self-refinement ability. Moreover, our direct sequence modeling paradigm can also ease optimization,
which provides a new feasible way for training Gaussian LRMs.

We also include a qualitative comparison using samples from the GRM paper in Figure 13. It indicates
that MVGamba captures better geometries and details with significantly smaller model size. Note
that we could not directly compare with GS-LRM as it only presents a single-view results in Figure 7
of their paper.

More quantitative results.
We leave the qualitative comparison on sparse-view reconstruction task
here. We compare the well-adpoted PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS for novel view synthesis [86] and Chamfer
Distance (CD) and Volume IoU (VIoU) for geometric evaluation. As shown in Table 4, MVGamba
outperforms all baselines across all metrics, even though SparseNeuS require 4 times more input
views, while maintaining fast inference and rendering speed.

Model Details

Network Configuration.
As detailed in Table 5, the SSM-based reconstructor comprises 14
Gamba blocks, each with hidden dimensions of 512. The architecture employs RMSNorm, SSM,
depth-wise convolution [87], and residual connections. In line with [24], positional embedding
is added rather than concatenated to the tokenized multi-view image tokens. These tokens have
512 dimensions, resulting in a total of 16,384 or 32,768 tokens, which correspond to the length of
Gaussian sequence. The Gaussian Decoder is a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a single
hidden layer containing 2,048 hidden dimensions. This is followed by sub-head linear projection
layers, which decode the output into 3D Gaussians for splatting.

RotationNet.
Our RotationNet (RotNet) is designed to facilitate the prediction of rotation attributes.
It comprises a set of 32 pre-defined canonical rotation quaternions and a learnable linear projection
matrix that maps input features to the logits of these quaternions. The canonical quaternions include
8 rotations around the principal axes (x, y, z) by 0 or 180 degrees, and 24 rotations by ±45 degrees
around various axes formed by combining two principal axes. During training, RotNet uses the
Gumbel-Softmax technique to enable differentiable sampling from the discrete set of quaternions.
The temperature parameter is gradually decreased from 2 to 0.01 over iterations, encouraging more
confident predictions. During inference, RotNet applies the argmax operation to the logits to select
the quaternion with the highest probability, operating in a non-differentiable manner.

the generation results for GRM were extracted from its paper and official project page. A direct
comparison with GS-LRM is currently unfeasible, as it is not open-source, and only a single view is
presented in Figure 7 of the GS-LRM paper.

Gaussian Parameterization.
As 3D Gaussians are an unstructured explicit representation, unlike
Triplane-NeRF’s structured implicit representation, the parameterization of the output parameters
significantly affects the model’s convergence. We provide the detailed pseudo code of Gaussian
parameterization in Figure 14 for better reproduciblility.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the main contributions and scope of
the paper, matching the experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations are discussed Section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

22


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides all necessary details to reproduce the experiments in
Section 4 and Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code is available online, and the dataset is open-sourced.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All training and evaluation details, including dataset, hyperparameters, opti-
mizers, and model configurations are listed in Section 4 and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

24


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Information on compute resources, including type of compute workers, mem-
ory and and execution time, are provided in Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, with social impacts
discussed in the checklist.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: While our work unify the 3D content generation, it also raises concerns
about potential negative societal effects, including the propagation of disinformation or the
amplification of harmful biases with the generated contents.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

25


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We plan to ask user to agree to usage guidelines before use our model after
released.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Licenses of dataset and pre-trained models are listed in Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

27


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
