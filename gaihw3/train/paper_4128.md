Abstract

We introduce FlexCap, a vision-language model that generates region-specific
descriptions of varying lengths. FlexCap is trained to produce length-conditioned
captions for input boxes, enabling control over information density, with descrip-
tions ranging from concise object labels to detailed captions. To achieve this,
we create large-scale training datasets of image region descriptions with varying
lengths from captioned web images. We demonstrate FlexCap’s effectiveness
in several applications: first, it achieves strong performance in dense captioning
tasks on the Visual Genome dataset. Second, we show how FlexCap’s localized
descriptions can serve as input to a large language model to create a visual question
answering (VQA) system, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on
multiple VQA benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate FlexCap’s utility for tasks
including image labeling, object attribute recognition, and visual dialog. Project

Introduction

How does one describe the world around us, not just in broad strokes but with the ability to zoom in
and out, capturing both the grand scene and the minute details? Imagine pointing at a bustling market
scene and asking, "What’s happening here?" and receiving a vivid description, not just of the market
as a whole, but also a detailed account of the interactions between vendors and customers, the vibrant
colors of the goods on display, or even a specific item held by a passerby. This ability to controllably
focus and describe visual content is what we call flexible captioning.

Traditional image captioning models, while adept at capturing the gist of an image, often struggle to
pinpoint specific objects or attributes. On the other hand, object detection systems excel at localizing
elements but may lack the vocabulary to describe them comprehensively. Dense captioning [26]
attempts to bridge this gap by generating captions for multiple regions, but its expressiveness is
limited by existing datasets. In this work, we introduce a model called FlexCap that bridges the gap
between holistic image understanding and localized inquiry. This enables the generation of captions
that are both spatially precise and semantically rich (see Fig. 1 (left)) by specifying a region of interest
and the desired level of detail in terms of number of words in the predicted caption. This allows us to
integrate the strengths of image captioning, object detection, and dense captioning into one model.

To be able to train such a model, we require a dataset of images where many boxes are labeled with
short and long descriptions. We propose a method to generate triplets of (i) image, (ii) a proposed
region within the image, and (iii) a caption of a particular length, by using an open-vocabulary object
detector to label regions from captions of an image-text pair dataset. We demonstrate this at two

Figure 1: FlexCap generates controllably rich localized descriptions for any region in an image as
shown on the left. It has the flexibility to produce captions in a controllable manner which allows the
full spectrum of valid descriptions to be explored from short object category names to fully-detailed
captions. On the right, we demonstrate that rich localized captions generated by FlexCap, when
coupled with large language models (LLMs), enable zero-shot visual question answering.
scales: 200 million triplets using YFCC100M [47] captioned images; and 32 billion triplets using
the WebLI [9] captioned dataset. Training FlexCap on these datasets enables the model to generate
spatially and semantically rich representations (bounding boxes and their descriptions) that focuses
on objects, their attributes, and their contextually changing descriptions.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the descriptions generated with FlexCap by representing images in
detail by describing its constituent objects and regions. A popular and effective strategy is to directly
provide visual features as input tokens to LLMs [2, 9, 14, 29, 30, 33, 59]. Instead we directly provide
textual descriptions of images as input to the LLM to evaluate FlexCap similar to [21, 42, 57]. We
show that this human interpretable representation, when combined with the power of LLMs, enables
visual question answering and dialog. An example is shown in Figure 1(right). We also demonstrate
that this combination can result in performance that is competitive with state-of-the-art VLM models
on zero-shot image and video question answering benchmarks.

Our key technical contributions are: (i) controllable localized visual descriptions, using word count as
a proxy for complexity to modulate the output of a generative language model (ii) a large-scale dataset
generated for image-text-box triplets to enable training of our model; (iii) the human-interpretable
representations produced by FlexCap with the help of LLMs is comparable or exceeds performance of
state-of-the-art VQA methods; and (iv) demonstrating that our dense captioning methods outperform
baselines under comparable scenarios.

FlexCap

Length conditioning. For the same region in an image, there may be multiple valid captions. In the
input image shown in Figure 2, all the following descriptions are correct: cat, grey and white cat,
grey and white cat lying on shoes. Clearly, the task of describing a bounding box in the image does
not have only one right answer. We equip the model with the capability of producing outputs of a
desired length by utilizing the idea of length conditioning. We condition the input by simply using an
additional token indicating the desired length of the output caption. Training with length-conditioning
is useful for three key reasons. First, the number of words used to describe is often proportional
to the information content. We train the model to predict the next word in the sequence while
accounting for the desired length, thereby the model learns to modulate the amount of information
in the generated text. Second, length conditioning allows users to control the output of the model,
further enabling the use of a single model for many diverse tasks. Third, the length prefix provides a
better conditioned initial state for the captioner. Figure 3 shows how the same box might have more
than one ground truth caption <s> a dog <e> or <s> dog playing with a frisbee <e>. If
we use the first caption as ground truth and the words <s> a dog as the seen text, the next-word
prediction loss encourages the model to increase its score for the <e> token and decrease the score
for the word playing due to the softmax loss. Whether this occurrence will be a problem depends
on the dataset statistics. To quantify the prevalence of this problem, we compute a statistic: for each
image box, we consider all pairs of captions and measure the fraction of pairs sharing prefix words.
For instance, consider a box that has three captions: <s> dog <e>, <s> dog playing <e>, and

Figure 2: Architecture and Training Setup. FlexCap outputs a length-controlled caption of the
object contained in the bounding box by taking (left) an image, (middle) coordinates of a bounding
box and (right) the length prefix and caption, as inputs. The training loss is the standard next-word
prediction loss that is used to train image captioning models.

<s> dog playing with a frisbee <e> which share a prefix <s> dog. While another caption
for the same box, <s> brown dog <e>, does not share a prefix with captions beginning with
<s> dog <e>. After averaging this metric across all images in our Localized Captions Dataset from
WebLI (introduced later in Section 3), we found that 30.8% of all caption pairs share a prefix. Using
a length conditioning token instead of <s>, the probability of prefix matching decreases from 30.8%
to 11.1%. The length conditioning helps the model in distinguishing between captions with the same
prefix while also providing the model with a novel capability during inference.

Architecture. Our objective is to train a model that takes as input an image and a region of interest
and outputs a description of a desired length of the region spanned by the box. We present FlexCap’s
architecture in Figure 2. The model takes an image, the coordinates of a bounding box and the
conditioning tokens as input, and outputs a textual description of visual contents within the specified
bounding box. Our model mainly consists of an image encoder (i.e. SOViT-400M/14 [1]) and a
transformer-based text-decoder. We pass the image through the vision model to produce outputs
of dimensions n × d (where n is the number of patches and d is the embedding size). We pass the
bounding box coordinates (of dimensions 1 × 4) through a linear layer to produce the coordinate
features (of dimension 1 × d). Both vision features and normalized bounding box features are
concatenated to form input of dimension (n + 1) × d to a text decoder. The text decoder consists
of a stack of L Transformer layers. We use a decoder-only architecture in which all the vision and
bounding box tokens remain unmasked but the text tokens are masked in a causal manner to enable
next-word prediction training. We add all the vision tokens and bounding box coordinate tokens so
that the text decoder can access all of the visual context in the image and the exact bounding box
location. In this work, we train a text decoder composed of 12 self-attention transformer layers with
a dimensionality of 768 and 12 attention heads.

In total, FlexCap has 590M parameters with 428M comprised of the image encoder (SOViT) and
the remaining parameters in the text decoder. A linear layer transforms the 1152-dimensional output
from the vision encoder into a 768-dimensional input for the text decoder. We initialize the vision
encoder with SigLIP [60] weights, which is a contrastively trained image encoder using web-scale
vision-text pairs from WebLI. We do not freeze the vision encoder during training.

Loss. We train FlexCap to predict the next token of the text. The text tokens are prefixed with the
desired length of the caption and appended with an end of sentence token <e> to indicate the end of
the caption. The target text tokens are obtained by shifting the padded text by 1. This is common
training methodology for training generative language models like GPT [8] or SimVLM [51]. The
loss is a classification loss over all the words present in the vocabulary. The loss is ignored over the
padded tokens that are used to keep the size of the outputs same for all the captions in the batch.
Formally, we represent a data sample as a triplet T = (X, B, W) consisting of image X, bounding
box B and captions W, where W = {LENGTH-K, w1, w2, ...wk}. To enable batch training, we pad
the tokenized captions to a fixed size M. For a given data triplet, our objective is to maximize the
following log-likelihood. l(X, B, W) = PM
i=1 log p(wi|w<i, X, B). Assume that we have a dataset

Implementation. We implement this model using the JAX framework [7]. We train the entire
model for about 400K steps using the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning rate schedule. The
maximum learning rate is 1.6 × 10−4 with 10K warm-up steps. We use a weight decay of 0.05. We
train with a batch size of 4096 and image resolution of 224 × 224. We use a maximum text sequence
length of 32 tokens. For each image in the batch, we sample a maximum of 8 bounding boxes.

Inference. At inference time, we provide an image, the target bounding box, and the desired length as
input. We then decode in an auto-regressive manner till the end of caption token <e> is encountered or
the maximum number of decoding steps is reached. While we can use standard sampling techniques
used in text-generation like beam search, temperature sampling, or nucleus sampling [19] to generate
multiple captions. We use greedy decoding in all experiments unless otherwise stated.

Localized Captions Dataset

In order to train the FlexCap model, we build a large scale dataset of image region descriptions of
varying lengths. In the following section we describe how we produce such a dataset from existing
image-text paired datasets. We leverage the web-based image-caption pairs datasets (like WebLI [9]
and YFCC100M [47]) to create a localized captions dataset. The dataset generation pipeline is
shown in Figure 3. First, we create text queries using n-grams from the caption of the image:
e.g. “dog",“brown dog", “brown dog playing with a disc". We specifically create n-grams where
n = {1, 2, · · · , 8} and then filter out incomplete captions like “with a red", “dog playing with". More
details about the filtering step are mentioned in the appendix. Then we use the filtered n-grams as
text queries for pre-trained region proposal models (i.e. OWL-ViT [36]) to extract boxes and select
text-box pairs based on the similarity score (> 0.1). Multiple n-grams may match for a box, and this
results in several ways of describing a box in the image as shown in Col. 4 in Figure 3.

WebLI. This data collection technique on the WebLI dataset results in 32 billion image-box-caption
triplets from 2 billion images without requiring new manual annotation. Our captions show a rich
vocabulary that is close to common language used to describe objects in the context of an image. If we
use MS-COCO’s vocabulary then all humans in the dataset would get labeled as person. However by
building our vocabulary in a bottom-up manner we end up with captions that contain more informative
words such as baby, nurse, policeman, firefighter, or baseball player to describe the person class.
Please refer to the appendix for details of dataset statistics and examples.

YFCC100M. We also create a localized captions dataset using YFCC100M images. Specifically we
use the same 14M images as the CLIP paper. The dataset creation method results in ∼11M images
with at least one valid box. On average each image has 20 boxes, making the size of this dataset
∼0.2B image-box-caption triplets. The number of YFCC100M triplets is 160 times smaller than
the localized captions dataset created from WebLI.

As both OWL-ViT and the CLIP subset of YFCC100M are publicly available, the resulting localized
captions dataset can be generated with open-source models and public datasets. Since the WebLI
dataset is not publicly available yet, YFCC100M triplet-dataset can serve as a reproducible benchmark.
Concurrently large-scale grounded image-text dataset generation pipelines have also been proposed
in [38] and [50].

Experiments

4.1
Correctness and Compliance of Generated Captions

Correctness. In this experiment, we solely evaluate the recognition capabilities of our model in a
zero-shot manner. We use the region classification task [53, 61] on the MS-COCO dataset to assess
how well our model recognizes objects at different scales and under occlusion. In this task, the image
and the ground truth bounding box are provided as input to the model such that it produces a short
description of what is contained in the bounding box. Our region classification pipeline (Figure 4)

captions is captured through different length descriptions for each box.

passes the input image (of size 448 × 448) through FlexCap which generates 20 captions each for
4 caption lengths (1, 2, 3, 4) via nucleus sampling. These captions are then mapped to object class
names using CLIP’s [39] text encoder. By comparing the mean of the text embeddings of predicted
captions with those of ground truth class names, we obtain the classification scores. We report the
results in Table 1a. We find FlexCap outperforms contrastively trained approaches used for region
classification. Furthermore, we observe a significant boost ( 13% mAP) in performance by producing
multiple captions for each box. One reason for the boost in performance may be directly comparing
text embeddings to produce classification scores as compared to baselines which use dot product of
image and text embeddings.

Compliance. In Figure 5, we show qualitative examples of the FlexCap model producing different
length captions for the same box. Note how the model progressively adds more information about
the object by incorporating context in the longer sentences (in the jungle), attributes (pink flamingo
kite), and alternative nouns (chevy, feline). We also measure how well our model complies to the
desired caption length. To do so, we take 1000 images from the MS-COCO dataset and use a random
object in the image to produce descriptions with different lengths. We report the average length of
the predicted caption, and the fraction of times the predicted caption has a length equal to the target
length in Table 1b. We find FlexCap’s outputs are mostly compliant with the target length.

4.2
Visual Question Answering

Visual question answering (VQA) often requires visually grounded rich semantic understanding of
the content at multiple levels of granularity depending on the question. These properties make VQA
a great test-bed for our method which can generate dense spatially grounded information on visual
content with desired semantic complexity.

FlexCap-LLM. In Figure 1 (right), we show how we use FlexCap with an LLM to solve visual
questions. First, we convert an image to a sequence of localized descriptions that describe the image
in terms of the objects and regions present in the image. To do so, we need region proposals. We
use OWL-ViTv2 [35] to localize important objects and regions in an image. We keep the top 128

bounding boxes by their objectness scores. We then use FlexCap to describe each box in the image in
the context of the entire image. In order to produce holistic descriptions, we use multiple prefixes
for each region. These prefixes are a combination of length conditioning token and some initial text.
We add the boxes and their descriptions to a text preamble as context to the LLM (see Figure 1)
that defines the setup where we are using an LLM to answer questions about an image. In all the
experiments, we use PALM2-S model [4] as the LLM of choice. We refer to this end-to-end system
that takes an image and a question to output the answer as FlexCap-LLM.

To adapt the base FlexCap to have improved detection skills, output longer sentences, and identify
OCR, we co-train FlexCap for 25k more steps on detection (COCO, VOC, OpenImages, LVIS),
captioning (COCO Captions, Visual Genome) and OCR datasets (WebLI). For image captioning
datasets, we use the bounding box that covers the whole image. We find this co-training step useful
for downstream tasks using the LLM.

Hence we evaluate the effectiveness of FlexCap-LLM on several image VQA benchmarks such as
OKVQA [34], VQAv2 [16], GQA [23], and VizWiz [18], and video question answering benchmarks
such as MSRVTT [55] and MSVD [54]. Diverse characterictics of these datasets helps gaining better
insight on FlexCap’s capabilities. We report the commonly used accuracy metric for each dataset.

Image Question Answering. First we evaluate FlexCap-LLM on VQAv2 , GQA, OKVQA and
VizWiz image VQA benchmarks in a zero-shot setting, meaning that our approach is not trained with
the task or the corresponding dataset. The results on these benchmarks are presented in Table 2.

Standard VQA. The VQAv2 dataset is a standard for evaluating the performance of visual question-
answering systems. In Table 2a, we present the results of our evaluation of FlexCap-LLM on this
dataset. We find that FlexCap-LLM outperforms other zero-shot baselines, such as BLIP-2. This
performance is achieved by providing object and region level information to LLMs without requiring
multi-modal fine-tuning.

Compositional VQA. The GQA dataset is for evaluating the performance on complex compositional
questions. As FlexCap produces information for multiple visual elements in the scene with their
corresponding locations, it is quite well-suited for questions on compositional understanding of the
image. On this benchmark, as shown in Table 2b, FlexCap-LLM outperforms all the recent baselines
except InstructBLIP [11].

VQA with External Knowledge. OKVQA dataset is particularly designed for evaluating the ability
to answer questions about images that require external knowledge which is not readily available on
the image. Hence it requires multiple levels of understanding of the content, and reasoning with
that information, which is well-suited for applying FlexCap. In Table 2c we show our performance
on OKVQA is superior to strong baselines such as Flamingo and ViperGPT which highlights the
effectiveness of the mix of generic and specific descriptions generated by FlexCap. Unlike other
baselines which use the question, FlexCap generates captions without having access to the question.

VQA with atypical images. We also evaluate on VizWiz, which contains visual questions asked by
people who are visually impaired. Unlike web content, in these images the objects and the scene are
not always well-centered, hence this dataset contains many out-of-distribution samples compared to
typical web-crawled datasets. We report the results of this experiment in Table 2d. Nevertheless, our
approach significantly outperforms Flamingo [2] and InstructBLIP [11] in the zero-shot setting.

Video Question Answering. We also evaluate FlexCap-LLM on zero-shot video question answering
datasets MSRVTT-QA and MSVD-QA [54]. The results on these benchmarks are presented in
Table 3. For processing the video, we sample 8 frames uniformly from the video. We pass each of
these frames through FlexCap to produce captions of objects and regions. We then combine all the
object captions from the different frames into one prompt for the LLM. We observe FlexCap-LLM

significantly exceeds the performance of the Flamingo model in the zero-shot setting. These results
highlight the zero-shot effectiveness of our method, which can solve tasks in the video domain even
though both FlexCap and the LLM were not trained for those tasks.

4.3
Dense Captioning

Dataset and Evaluation Metrics. The dense captioning task is defined as producing both the
regions and the corresponding descriptions for each region. For this experiment, we use the Visual
Genome [28] dataset. In this dataset, each image is annotated with multiple bounding boxes and
each box has a corresponding caption. We use the train-test splits and evaluation metric as proposed
in [26]. The paper proposes to use a mean of Average Precisions (mAP) over pairwise thresholds of
both IOU thresholds (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7) and Meteor score thresholds (0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2,
0.25). We use the same preprocessing of text and boxes as mentioned in [52].

Fine-tuning FlexCap. We fine-tune the pretrained FlexCap model on the Visual Genome train split
for 60k steps with a lower learning rate of 1e −6 at a resolution of 448 × 448.

Captioning GT boxes. Following the evaluation procedure from [26], we evaluate captioning of the
ground-truth boxes in Visual Genome. Since this setting removes the localization task, we have a
cleaner evaluation of only the region captioning problem. The results of this experiment are provided
in Table 4a in which we show that FlexCap achieves better performance compared to other approaches
evaluated in this setting.

Captioning GRIT boxes. In this experiment, we want to compare against other approaches that
perform both localization and captioning. We are measuring how well FlexCap performs when
provided with box proposals. Table 4b shows FlexCap obtains better performance compared to other
approaches evaluated in this setting. Since in our work we do not propose any localization module,
we use GRIT’s [52] region proposals as the input boxes for our model. This also allows us to directly
compare our captioning capabilities against GRIT. We find that our approach outperforms GRIT at
this task even though we test at a lower resolution of 448 × 448.

4.4
Open-Ended Object Detection

Open-ended object detection, that is identifying all the objects in the image with rich descriptions,
can be achieved in two ways: (a) localize-then-describe or (b) describe-then-localize. With Flex-
Cap, we employ a localize-then-describe approach where boxes are generated with a box proposal
mechanism (i.e. OWL-ViT) and then described by FlexCap. We compare these results with a
describe-then-localize approach where we first ask a state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLM (i.e. LLAVA [33])
for a comprehensive description of the image with all objects and then localize these descriptions
using a SOTA open-vocabulary object detection method (i.e. OWL-ViT [36]). The Recall of all the
objects in the image is a major criteria in open-ended object detection. As shown in Figure 6(a), we
demonstrate that localize-then-describe approach powered with FlexCap performs significantly better
compared to describe-then-localize approach using existing works. In Figure 6 (b-e), we observe
that our localize-then-describe approach retrieves more parts of the image, particularly the small
and medium size objects, compared to the describe-then-localize approach. This is mainly because
most VLMs are trained to describe the salient objects in the image rather than exhaustively list all the
objects present in the scene.

4.5
Discussion

Prefixing. Training on a large dataset also enables the extraction of different kinds of information
from an image using prefixes. We can use this property to our advantage to extract object properties
such as color and material. We show examples of this in Figure 7. Say we want to extract the
color and material of objects, we design two prefixes: 1) "LENGTH-4 The color is ____" and 2)
"LENGTH-5 This is made of ____". The pre-fixed length tokens guide the model to produce outputs
that are just one more word. Note how the model is aware of the input prefix and completes based on
the object in the bounding box without confusing it with other surrounding objects. We show more
examples of using the prefix to define in Fig. 8. FlexCap can extract the following attributes with the
corresponding prefix in the brackets: the actions of humans ("The person is"), the uses of objects
("This is used for"), OCR ("The sign says"), names of books ("The book is called"), authors of books

Figure 6: Open-Ended Object Detection on the Visual Genome dataset. We find that the localize-
then-describe approach, which involves describing every detected box with FlexCap, achieves higher
recall (see (a)) and produces more bounding boxes with good matching scores (see (b)) compared to
describe-then-localize approach with SOTA VLMs and open-vocabulary detection. The difference
between the two approaches is most stark for small and medium sized objects (see (c-e)).

("Written by"), and the locations where the photos were taken ("The photo was taken in"). Note the
same model can extract different information from the same bounding box: the name of the book title
and the author name based on the prefixing (col 4-5).

Limitations. We use OWL-ViT and alt-text to generate the training dataset for the model rather than
relying on human annotations. While this approach allows us to scale, there exist biases in the model
and alt-text which will reflect in the outputs of FlexCap. Another limitation is that the proposed
FlexCapLLM system is not end-to-end trainable but is a composition of a VLM and LLM. This can
be alleviated by training a VLM with the localized captioning dataset.

Broader Impact. Localized and controllable image captioning enabled by our model may benefit
applications like accessibility tools for visual impairments and intuitive human-computer interaction.
However, biases in training data raise concerns around potential misrepresentation or exclusion of
certain demographics. Dual-use risks also exist if this model is employed for unethical surveillance.

Related Work

Visual question answering (VQA), a task designed to assess if a computer can answer questions
about an image, often requires grounding visual concepts and reasoning. Although initially introduced
for supervised evaluation of the task [5], most recently, VQA also become one of the most powerful
benchmarks for evaluating task and dataset independent visual dialog. Several existing models such

9


---Page Break---
as ViperGPT [44], Flamingo [2], BLIP [29, 30], PaLI [10] show convincing zero-shot performance
on the VQA benchmarks that rivals the supervised approaches. Unlike most previous zero-shot
approaches, which tightly couple vision and language components in a single model, FlexCap
generates a high-level human interpretable representation of an image and demonstrates that, through
straight-forward application of LLMs, we can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art
results across VQA benchmarks. Unlike others, ViperGPT [44], also decouples vision and language
components and reinterprets visual questions with LLM generated programs, and executes them
using existing visual perception tools. Whereas, in our case we use only one powerful vision tool, i.e.
FlexCap, to generate all the necessary information and leave the reasoning to an LLM. In that sense,
FlexCap is quite complementary to ViperGPT as it can be one of the powerful tools that can improve
the controllable visual understanding of the image for ViperGPT.

Open vocabulary object detection models like OWL-ViT [36] and ViLD [17] enable the user to
query any given text on the image and obtain matched bounding boxes for those queries. In these
models the text is often encoded by a text encoder like CLIP [39] and T5 [40]. The text embeddings
are compared with the category-agnostic box proposals coming from the visual backbone. In this
work, we use OWL-ViT’s text and vision encoders to associate bounding boxes with text-queries
to produce our training data. By training a localized captioning model, we remove the manual
step of providing per-dataset or per-image text queries to use OWL-ViT. RegionCLIP [61] obtained
good performance on open-vocabulary object detection by utilizing region-level vision-language
contrastive learning on large scale data. We differ from this work as we generate the description for
each bounding box instead of associating text queries (defined manually) with bounding boxes.

Dense captioning involves localizing salient regions of the image and describing them with natural
language sentences, introduced in [26]. In practice, the existing work often produces longer and more
informative descriptions of objects or their compositions using visual attributes of objects [27, 58] or
contextual and global image cues [31, 56]. However, the richness of descriptions in this line of work
are often limited to existing image captioning datasets [28, 32]. By utilizing a large scale dataset of
billions of noisy image-text pairs collected from the web (similar to [9, 24]), we aim to generate more
diverse sentences with a focus on describing the visual content in controllable detail using a richer
visual descriptive space learned from the web.

Length-controlled image captioning has been explored in ZeroCap [46] and LIC [13]. ZeroCap [46]
implements length control as a post-processing step by changing the probability of sampling the
end-of-sentence token. Hence the model is not naturally trained with word length conditioning in
mind and cannot guarantee fine-grained length control at the level of number of words. On the other
hand, LIC [13] generates length-controllable captions by conditioning the model with learned tokens
that represent different length intervals. However there are considerable differences compared to
FlexCap. First, our approach allows for controllability at the level of image regions, while LIC only
provides full image captions. This is a significant difference, as it allows us to generate concise or
detailed captions for all the objects in the image. Second, our approach has a more precise level of
caption-length control. LIC uses a coarse subjective level of control with four or five levels of length
(e.g. short, medium, long, and longer), while our approach allows for an exact number of words to be
specified. [48] also propose an approach to produce variable length descriptions for objects localized
interactively. They use a pre-trained image captioner to produce descriptions of objects and ChatGPT
in post-hoc to output length-conditioned captions. While in our FlexCap model, the length tokens
modulate the output produced by the captioner.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduce FlexCap, a flexible captioning model that can describe localized regions in
an image with controllably rich captions. To train FlexCap, we generate a large-scale image-box-
caption dataset that is rich in diversity of visual descriptions and their length. We achieve this by
utilizing existing web-scale noisy image-text pairs and open-vocabulary object detection models. We
show how localized rich descriptions provided by FlexCap can help us connect images and videos to
LLMs and achieve strong performance on visual question answering and dense captioning tasks. We
also show that our FlexCap model benefits from contrastive pretraining, localized captions dataset
size scaling, model size scaling, and is compliant to length conditioning. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of FlexCap-enabled localize-then-describe approach over the describe-then-localize
approaches.

Appendix

A
Localized Captions Dataset Details

WebLI. Our dataset creation process on the WebLI dataset results in ∼32 billion Image-Box-Caption
triplets. In Figure 9a, we show the distribution of caption lengths in the generated dataset using
WebLI. We observe that the distribution is not uniform. This is due to the fact that there are more
n-grams of length 1 to sample than length 8. The average number of unique boxes in an image is
4.19, and the average number of captions per box is 4.04.

YFCC100M.Our dataset creation process on the CLIP subset of the YFCC100M dataset results in
∼0.2 billion Image-Box-Caption triplets. In Figure 9b, we show the distribution of caption lengths in
the generated dataset using YFCC100M. The average number of unique boxes in an image is 6.3,
and the average number of captions per box is 3.3.

(a) WebLI Dataset
(b) YFCC100M Dataset

Figure 9: Distribution of caption lengths in the Localized Captions Dataset. We show the
distribution of caption length for the region-captions obtained using paired image-texts from two
datasets: WebLI [9] and YFCC100M [47]

.

N-gram Filtering. Before matching n-grams with boxes, we filter out n-grams that do not form
informative or grammatically correct captions for boxes. This is done with three steps: 1) Removing
any captions composed only of uninformative words (image, jpg, background, wallpaper, hd wallpaper
etc.); 2) Removing n-grams that begin with words with which sentences usually do not start (of, on,
in etc.); 3) Removing n-grams that finish with words with which sentences usually do not end (a, the,
to, on etc.). This step is essential to reduce noise present in the large-scale image-text pair dataset
obtained from the web. It is also important for the captioning model to produce grammatically correct
informative sentences.

Dataset Samples. We show some samples from the dataset in Figure 10. The alt-text from which the
box captions are generated is provided as the title of the image. Note the alt-text gets clipped due to
display-length limits which is why the detected boxes might have captions not visible in the displayed
alt-text directly. We next discuss how captions of varying lengths are matched with different objects
in an image.

B
Ablations and Analysis

Large-scale Contrastive Pre-Training. In this section, we study the impact of using a contrastively
pre-trained vision encoder or training from scratch using only box-caption objective. For this
experiment, we use ViT-B/16 as our backbone and train on the WebLI Region Captioning dataset.
We report the results on ground truth (GT) box captioning and dense captioning on GRiT proposals
on the Visual Genome dataset in Table 5a. In Row 1, we observe that a length-conditioned region
captioning objective can be used for training both the backbone and text decoder from scratch
and achieve competitive performance. Second, we observe using a large-scale contrastively pre-
trained (CPT) model results in better performance. Note that these CPT weights have already been
open-sourced [60].

(c) Model Scaling

Table 5: Ablations. We vary different aspects of model pre-training, dataset size, and model size and
measure its effect on region captioning task on the Visual Genome dataset. In (a) and (b) the visual
backbone is ViT-B/16 and in (b) and (c) all models start from contrastively pre-trained weights.

Figure 11: Objects missed by LLAVA but found by FlexCap. We show some typical examples of
objects (5 per image to avoid clutter) that FlexCap can find with OWL-ViT but LLAVA does not.

Data Scaling. In this experiment we measure how scaling the localized captions dataset affects
performance. We first take ViT-B/16 encoder contrastively pre-trained with a large image-text dataset
(WebLI). We now train it on two different region captioning datasets of different scales. We show
the results of this experiment in Table 5b. We find that even after contrastive pre-training on a large
scale, a large region-caption dataset can result in significant performance boost (∼5% mAP for GT
box captioning). This shows the importance of designing a scalable dataset creation method such as
the one introduced in Section 4.3. We also note that the dataset and pre-trained weights required to
reproduce the model with YFCC100M are available publicly.

Model Scaling. Next, we measure the impact of changing the model size. We train two models:
ViT-B/16 (85M) v/s SO-ViT/14 (428M). Just like the data scaling experiments, both of these have
been pre-trained on the WebLI dataset in a contrastive manner. We report the results of this experiment
in Table 5c. We find that the larger model results in better performance.

C
Open-Ended Object Detection

In this experiment, we compare the effectiveness of a describe-then-localize method (specif-
ically LLAVA 1.5 [33] 7B + OWL-ViTv2 [35]) with a localize-then-describe method
(specially FlexCap + OWL-ViTv2) for the task of open-ended object detection.
For
the describe-then-localize method,
we generate a list of objects using the following
prompt:Describe object names and regions in this image. We extract the nouns and use
them as text queries for OWL-ViTv2. For the localize-then-describe approach, we take the top
128 objects ranked by objectness score by OWL-ViTv2 and describe them with different length
prompts. In Fig. 5 in the main paper, we compare recall of the ground-truth regions annotated in the
Visual Genome dataset for both these approaches. We find that while describe-then-localize with
LLAVA can be an effective approach for finding large objects, localize-then-describe with FlexCap is
significantly better at medium and small sized objects and marginally better for large-sized objects.
We show some typical examples of missed detections in Fig. 11.

Different prefixes with same image

In Fig. 12, we highlight how different prefixes can be used to generate diverse captions. Note how in
column 1 the model correctly identifies the country even, possibly using the logo on the train. We
find the prefix "Notice" leads to captions highlighting noteworthy aspects in an image which the
un-prefixed caption does no.

E
Visual Dialog

FlexCap-LLM can be used for the task of visual dialog [12]. We first caption all the objects in the
image using FlexCap and OWL-ViTv2. We retain the top 128 boxes according to the objectness score
from OWL-ViTv2 and describe each box using FlexCap. See Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 in the main paper
for more details. Once the image has been represented as the list of objects in text, we can interact
with a LLM by providing the conversation turns as additional context for each query to the LLM.
We show some examples of conversations with the FlexCap-LLM system in Figure 13. Note how
the model is able to read text in the image in the leftmost figure, recognize material in the middle
figure, and localize objects of interest in the rightmost figure. As we compute the object captions
only once at the beginning of the conversation, there is no additional overhead of querying a large
VLM for each additional turn in the conversation. We show more examples of this on the webpage in
the FlexCap-LLM section of index.html.

F
Effect of Length on FlexCapLLM

In this experiment, we study the effect of generating captions of different lengths on downstream
visual question answering tasks. We evaluate this by using captions of increasing lengths on the
val split of the VQAv2 dataset. We report the results of this experiment in Table 6. We find that
increasing the length of generated captions results in better VQAv2 and GQA performance.

FlexCapLLM Details

In Fig. 14 we show the whole pipeline how FlexCap interfaces with LLMs. We convert an image
into a list of localized texts. These texts are passed onto the LLM with a preamble indicating the task
and the VQA task’s question. We use the following prompts for the LLM in the question-answering
experiments.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We claim that we can train a vision language model conditioned on bounding
box and desired caption length. We show in the experiments that we can train such a model.
Furthermore, we claimed that using this model we can describe an image densely using
just words. We show that connecting these descriptions to an LLM leads to better dense
captioning performance and zero-shot visual question answering performance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the Discussion section we have included limitations of the current work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

21


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:No theoretical claims.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes the dataset is produced using a public model. The weights of our vision
backbone are also open-sourced. The decoder is trained from scratch. We include results
in the ablations in the appendix section for models trained on open-source YFCC100M
data. We will release training code and model inference code. The part that cannot be
open-sourced is the WebLI dataset. We will attempt to release the model trained on WebLI
dataset though.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

22


---Page Break---
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The base open-source dataset with which results can be replicated is
YFCC100M. The object detector used is OWL-ViTv2. The vision backbone is SigLIP
pretrained SO400M.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We mention these details in the implementation section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Error bars are not included as conducting a single run of pre-training is very
resource intensive due to the large size of the dataset.
Guidelines:

23


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Dataset size, model size, batch size, hardware and number of training steps
have been mentioned in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have read the code of ethics and this work does not violate its guidelines.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

---Page Break---
Justification: Refer to Broader Impact section of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Models will be released after safeguards are put in place.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All work that is directly used in development of data and models used in this
paper have been appropriately cited.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

25


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: New assets are not released right now.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work did not involve human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work did not involve human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

26


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
