Abstract

Recent vision foundation models can extract universal representations and show
impressive abilities in various tasks. However, their application on object detection
is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In this work, we show
that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature enhancer, even though
they are not pre-trained for object detection. Specifically, we explore directly
transferring the high-level image understanding of foundation models to detectors
in the following two ways. First, the class token in foundation models provides an
in-depth understanding of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object
queries in the detector’s decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the
patch tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector’s encoder
by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as plug-and-play
modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly enhance the
detector’s performance while preventing the problems caused by the architecture
discrepancy between the detector’s backbone and the foundation model. With such
a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO from 49.0% AP
to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP) by integrating one
or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation set after training
for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector’s backbone.

Introduction

Understanding an image at both global and local levels is a key factor for a wide range of vision
perception tasks. Typically, in object detection, an in-depth understanding of the image can assist
model reasoning under many challenging situations. First, the conflict between detecting the whole
object and parts of it always exists in object detection since parts of the object are also annotated in
many scenarios, e.g., objects under occlusion. With a global understanding of the image, detectors
can recognize different parts of the same object and detect the objects as completely as possible,
as shown in Figure 1 (a). Second, the co-occurrence of objects can facilitate finding some missing
objects. In Figure 1 (b), a man is sitting on something, from which we can infer that it is a bench with
a strange appearance. And the bottle aside the man may help us find the bottle in his hand. Moreover,

some salient features can also help us distinguish similar objects, i.e., distinguishing the fish and
broccoli from birds as shown in Figure 1 (c). Prior efforts to enhance detectors’ image understanding
ability include using a strong backbone with a large receptive field [30, 23, 18] and explicitly injecting
scene information to detectors [48, 14, 12]. Recent query-based detectors [3, 73, 22, 66] modeling
object queries via the global self-attention mechanism also enjoy global reasoning. In this work, we
explore the image understanding ability from outside knowledge rather than the detector itself.

In light of this, we focus on the recently attractive foundation models, which have shown an impressive
understanding of the image via large-scale pre-training, even without task-specific data. For example,
DNF CLIP [21] with ViT-H can achieve 84.4% zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet [17],
achieving similar results to the same ViT-H [19] (85.1%) trained in a supervised way. Benefiting
from the advanced architecture, extensively collected data, and well-designed pre-training tasks, the
off-the-shelf foundation models are already equipped with strong image understanding abilities.

In this work, we propose Frozen-DETR, which uses a frozen foundation model as a plug-and-play
module to boost the performance of query-based detectors. Instead of using the foundation model
as a backbone, we regard it as a feature enhancer from two perspectives: First, to utilize the global
image understanding ability of foundation models, we take the class token from them as the full
image representation, termed image query. The image query is concatenated with object queries and
facilitates decoding object queries in the decoder by providing a complex scene context. Second, the
fine-grained patch tokens with high-level semantic cues from foundation models are considered as
another level of the feature pyramid, which is then fused with the detector’s feature pyramid via the
encoder layers. The foundation model is parallel with the backbone and frozen during training.

Compared with methods that use the foundation model as a learnable backbone [40, 13] or a
frozen backbone [58, 44], our method enjoys the advantages in the following three aspects: a) No
architecture constraint. Since we do not require the foundation model to extract multi-scale features,
any architecture, CNNs, ViTs, or hybrid ones, can be used as the foundation model’s architecture.
Besides, the detector and the foundation model can use different structures. b) Plug-and-play. Our
method can be plugged into various query-based detectors without modifying the detector’s structure,
the foundation model’s structure, and the training recipe. c) Asymmetric input size. We use the
foundation model as a feature enhancer rather than a backbone. The input image size of the foundation
model can be much smaller than the one for the backbone (e.g., 336 vs. 1333). Considering the
asymmetric input size, we can use a large foundation model with an acceptable computation burden.

We find that CLIP [54] is one of the best candidates for Frozen-DETR, and its high-level seman-
tic understanding significantly enhances the classification ability of DETRs in many challenging
scenarios. Taking the well-known DINO [66] detector as the baseline, we boost its performance
to 53.2% AP (+2.8%) on the COCO dataset. On the large vocabulary LVIS dataset, Frozen-DETR
increases an impressive 6.6% AP. Considering the long-tail data distribution, Frozen-DETR increases
8.7% APr and 7.7% APc, showing the potential to alleviate the class imbalance problem. On the
open-vocabulary scenario, we increase by 8.8% novel AP, showing strong open-vocabulary ability.
Further, Frozen-DETR achieves almost the same performance on the COCO-O [50] dataset compared
with the one on the in-domain COCO dataset, showing great domain generalization ability.

Figure 2: The overview of Frozen-DETR. Instead of serving as a backbone, we exploit the frozen
foundation model from the following two aspects: First, the patch tokens are reshaped to a 2D feature
map and are concatenated with feature maps from the backbone before the encoder. After feature
fusion, the patch tokens are discarded. Second, the image query representing the whole image, i.e.,
the class token from the foundation model, interacts with object queries in the self-attention layer of
each decoding stage. Using the frozen foundation model as a feature enhancer makes the detector
inherit the strong ability to understand high-level semantics.

Foundation models and their application in object detection. Recent vision foundation models
can be divided into supervised ones [57, 54, 39, 35] and self-supervised ones [11, 4, 60, 27, 1, 61, 10,
70, 52]. Training foundation models in a supervised manner need to collect web-scale high-quality
datasets, such as image classification dataset ImageNet-22k [17] (DEiT-III [57]), image-text pair
dataset WIT [54] (CLIP), grounding dataset GoldG [39] (GLIP), and segmentation dataset SA-
1B [35] (SAM). Training with gold annotations from humans, these models can be directly applied
to many downstream tasks without fine-tuning. However, the human-annotated datasets are hard
to scale up due to intensive labor. Self-supervised learning is an alternative. With well-designed
pre-tasks, e.g., contrastive learning [11, 4, 60, 65], mask image modeling [27, 1, 61, 10], or their
combination [70, 52], models can learn distinctive representations without human annotations. But to
unleash the power of self-supervised learning on downstream tasks, models should be fine-tuned with
task-specific data.

Pre-training-then-fine-tuning is a common paradigm to use the pre-trained foundation models in
object detection. By transferring the pre-trained knowledge, the detector can converge much faster
than training from scratch [28], shows better advantages in robustness and uncertainty [31], and even
gains higher performance. However, in this paradigm, the detector should use the same backbone as
the pre-trained foundation model to transfer the pre-trained weights. Unfortunately, not all backbones
are suitable for dense prediction tasks. Thus, many task-oriented designs are introduced to compensate
for the structure inadaptability, e.g., ViT-Adapter [13]. Besides, fine-tuning a large foundation model
is not always acceptable due to resource constraints. To this end, a few works [58, 44] explore using
frozen foundation models as the backbone. To make the frozen backbone work in object detection,
modifying the structure (heavy neck and head) and the training recipe (long training schedule) is
necessary. In this work, we explore using the foundation model as a feature enhancer rather than the
backbone, which can avoid the problems mentioned above.

Query-based object detectors. Different from traditional detectors [55, 29, 42, 51], DETR [3]
formulates object detection as a set prediction task, which is an end-to-end model without using non-
maximum suppression (NMS). The following improvements mainly include advanced formulations
of object queries [73, 24, 62, 45, 47], stabilizing bipartite matching [36, 66, 46], providing more
supervision signals [8, 6, 34, 74, 68], alleviating conflict or competition between object queries [67,
32, 53] and knowledge distillation [5, 33, 9]. In this work, we explore enhancing DETR from another
aspect by utilizing the image understanding ability of off-the-shelf foundation models.

Foundation Models as Feature Enhancers

3.1
Preliminaries

Vision Transformer (ViT). Recently, transformer [59] has been shown to be a scalable architec-
ture [16, 2, 37] and many foundation models [54, 52, 61, 27, 57] are based on it. Different from
CNNs, ViT [19] first splits images into patches and projects each patch to a patch token. These tokens
are flattened in spatial dimensions and modeled in a sequence manner. In addition to patch tokens, a
learnable class token is prepended to the patch sequence. The patch tokens preserve the local details
for each patch, while the class token represents the global information for the whole image. We take
both the class token and patch tokens into account to enhance the detector’s ability.

DETR. A common DETR-like [3] detector includes 3 parts: backbone, encoder, and decoder. The
backbone can be any architecture that produces feature pyramids. The encoder uses deformable
attention [73] to enhance the feature maps while avoiding unaffordable computation costs from global
self-attention. Taking the refined feature maps and some object queries as inputs, the decoder aims to
refine the object queries layer by layer and predicts the class label and box coordinates for each object
query. In the subsequent improvement, each object query can be divided into two parts: content vector
representing the feature for each object, and position vector indicating the location for each object.
During the training, each object query will be optimized towards a single object or background.

In this work, we employ patch tokens from foundation models to enhance the DETR’s encoder via
feature fusion and facilitate the decoding process of DETR’s decoder with the class token from
foundation models.

3.2
Enhancing Decoder by Treating Class Tokens as Image Queries

We introduce a new kind of query into the decoder, termed image query. Different from conventional
object queries whose content vector represents a single object and the position vector is the bounding
box of the object, the image query represents the whole image, and its box is the full image boundary.
Since pre-trained foundation models have a strong ability to understand complex images at a global
level, we take advantage of their scene-understanding ability and treat the class token as the image
query. With the image query as context, object queries can be better classified.

Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, for each image, we extract the image query by passing the raw
image to the frozen foundation model. The image is resized to the pre-training image size of the
foundation model. Then, in each decoder layer, we project the image query to the same dimensions as
object queries and concatenate these two kinds of queries before feeding them into the self-attention
module. In the following self-attention computation, object queries can interact adaptively with the
image query to absorb high-level image understanding from the foundation model. Finally, the image
query is discarded after passing the self-attention module.

Since a single global image query may overlook several inconspicuous small objects, to compensate
for this and provide fine-grained local context, we propose to split the image into multiple sub-images
evenly and equip each sub-image with an image query. For example, if we split the image into

2 × 2 = 4 sub-images, we will obtain 5 image queries, including an original global image query and
four local image queries. A straightforward method to obtain multiple image queries is to crop the
sub-images from the original one and pass them to the foundation model individually, as shown in
Figure 3 (a). However, forwarding the foundation model multiple times is always time-consuming,
especially when the foundation model is large enough.

We provide two fast implementations to tackle the above limitation. In the first implementation
(Figure 3 (b)), we spatially split the entire patch tokens into multiple groups of tokens corresponding
to the sub-images, where the mean feature of each token group is regarded as its local image query.
The second one employs extra replicated class tokens to extract local image queries. We apply a
masked attention operation to ensure each local class token focuses on its corresponding sub-image by
restricting the interaction to a local area, as shown in Figure 3 (c). These two fast implementations can
obtain global and all local image queries in a single forwarding process, thus significantly reducing
the computation costs. Finally, all image queries are concatenated with object queries.

3.3
Enhancing Encoder by Feature Fusion

In addition to utilizing the global scene understanding of foundation models in the decoder, we further
reuse the patch tokens with fine-grained semantic details. Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we take
patch tokens from the last layer of foundation models and reshape them to a 2D feature map. This 2D
feature map is then concatenated with the feature maps from the detector’s backbone and passed to
the encoder, allowing adaptive fusion. After fusion, the backbone features are expected to assimilate
the high-level semantic understanding in foundation models. We empirically find that we can simply
discard the patch tokens after feature fusion, and using the enhanced feature maps from the detector’s
backbone is sufficient. Note that the feature map of patch tokens (24 × 24 for an image with input
size 336 and patch size 14) is much smaller than feature maps from the backbone (167 × 167 for an
image with input size 1333 and stride 8), the additional computation burden is acceptable.

Experiments

In the following subsections, we first explore the best practices of using foundation models as plug-
and-play modules and then show the highly engaging performance under various scenarios. Since the
detector DINO [66] and the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2 [52] share the same name
and may cause confusion. We rename the detector DINO as DINO-det in the following.

4.1
Image Queries Provide Complex Contexts

Setting. In this subsection, we take AdaMixer [24] as the baseline to explore the usage of image
queries since it is a decoder-only detector and converges fast with a small computation cost. All
experiments are conducted on the COCO [43] dataset with 300 queries, 12 training epochs, and 4
V100 GPUs. Unless otherwise specified, we employ the ImageNet-1k [17] supervised pre-training
ResNet-50 (R50) [30] as the backbone of the detector.

Are image queries helpful? In this ablation study, we use the OpenAI CLIP ViT-L-14-336 [54] to
extract the global image query. As shown in the upper part of Table 1, with only one global image
query appended to object queries, the AP significantly increases by 0.9%. Although the global image
query represents the information from a global view, the AP for both small (+0.8% APs) and large
(+1.8% APl) objects are increased.

Are image queries equal to a better detector backbone? We change the detector’s backbone to the
CLIP R50 and train it along with the detector. As shown in the lower part of Table 1, using a stronger
backbone improves the AP to 45.5%, which is in line with common experience. Nevertheless, using

an additional global image query further increases 0.6% AP, showing that using the foundation model
as an image query is orthogonal to using the foundation model as a backbone.

Which foundation model is more suitable to extract image queries? In this experiment, we choose
5 representative foundation models with different pre-training methods: DEiT-III [57] (ImageNet-22k
supervised pre-training), CLIP [54] (image-text pair alignment), MAE [27], BEiT-3 [61] (masked
data modeling) and DINOv2 [52] (masked data modeling and online self-distillation). All the models
use the ViT-L and the input image sizes are adjusted to 336 by interpolating the positional embedding.
For models that do not use the class token during the pre-training (MAE and BEiT-3), we use the
mean patch tokens as the image query. Besides, we also use the mean feature from the detector’s
backbone as the image query for a clear comparison, denoted as “Self”. As shown in Table 2, using
the mean backbone feature of the detector as the image query does not help much since the DETRs
already model object queries with global self-attentions. Besides, we find that the foundation models
which are pre-trained using human labels (DEiT-III and CLIP) perform better than the self-supervised
counterparts, perhaps the self-supervised ones lack the high semantic from human supervision thus
the features can not be utilized in the down-stream tasks without fine-tuning. Another possible reason
is that models pre-trained with masked data modeling could focus more on local texture details. Since
image-text pairs are more scalable than image classification datasets, we choose the OpenAI CLIP
(ViT-L-14-336) as the foundation model in the following experiments.

Extracting image queries with fast implementations. As demonstrated in Section 3.2, using some
additional local image queries to represent sub-images can preserve more details for the local context.
Table 3 illustrates the results of different implementations. The training time ttrain is the total time
for training 12 epochs and the inference time is tested on a single V100 GPU with batch size 1.
As shown in Table 3, cropping sub-images from the original one can increase the AP to 45.7% but
with more training time (+18h) and inference time (+150%) since images should pass through the
whole foundation model for multiple times. In contrast, using the mean patch token or multiple class
tokens can save much time as only one pass is needed. However, using the mean patch token is less
effective since the patch token is less representative than the class token in ViT CLIP [64]. Thus, in
the following experiments, we use multiple class tokens to extract multiple image queries by default.

How many image queries do we need? We conduct experiments with 0, 1, 5 (1+4), and 14
(1+4+9) image queries and achieve 44.1% AP, 45.0% AP, 45.8% AP, and 45.6% AP, respectively. We
empirically find that using 5 image queries is enough and more image queries do not help. Thus we
use 5 image queries by default.

Patch Tokens Enhance Feature Fusion in Encoder

Setting. In this subsection, we change the baseline to Co-DINO [74], which has both transformer
encoder and decoder. For fast implementation, we use four-scale feature maps (1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64)
and do not use co-heads. All experiments are conducted on the COCO [43] dataset with R50, 900
queries, 12 training epochs, and 4 V100 GPUs.

Ablation studies on each component of feature fusion. As shown in Table 4, adding image queries
to the new detector also gets 1.8% AP gains (Exp. 2), showing its generalizability. If we regard the
patch tokens as an additional 24 × 24 feature map and append it to the encoder (5-scale feature maps
now, Exp. 3), the AP further increases by 1.8% AP. Since the added feature map is small and the
foundation model is frozen, the additional computation cost and training time GPU memory (batch
size 2 per GPU) are acceptable. We further find sending the patch tokens to the cross-attention in the
decoder (Exp. 4) is unnecessary and we simply discard the patch tokens after the encoder.

Ablation studies on the input image size of the foundation model. In Table 5, we change the input
size to 224, 336, 448, and 560, and achieve 51.5% AP (333 GFLOPs), 52.6% AP (400 GFLOPs),
53.1% AP (494 GFLOPs), and 52.8% AP (615 GFLOPs). We find that the input image size is not
necessarily the larger, the better. On the one hand, the image size should not be too large since the
foundation model is pre-trained under a small resolution. On the other hand, the foundation model
provides a high-level semantic image understanding rather than location texture details. Thus, the
large input size is not necessary. Further, the large input size brings a huge computation burden since
the self-attention module in the foundation models has a quadratic complexity in the length of patch
tokens. By default, we use 336 as the input image size.

Ablation studies on the model size of the foundation model. In Table 6, we change the foundation
model with various model sizes (R101, ViT-B-16, ViT-L-14) but keep the number of patch tokens to a
similar size. There is a clear trend that a stronger foundation model can achieve higher performance,
showing the great scalability of our method.

Fine-tuning or freezing the foundation model. To make the fine-tuning affordable, we use CLIP
R101 as the foundation model in this experiment. As shown in Table 7, tuning the foundation
model with the detector underperforms the frozen one. We assume that training with much fewer
downstream task data breaks the pre-trained representations in foundation models.

Main Results on COCO dataset

In this subsection, we apply our Frozen-DETR (CLIP ViT-L-14-336) to various well-known detectors,
including DAB-DETR [45], DN-DETR [36], MS-DETR [68], HPR [69], DINO-det [66] and Co-
DINO [74]. We strictly follow their experiment settings without changing any hyper-parameters.

As shown in Table 8, Frozen-DETR outperforms baselines ranging from 2.7% AP to 4.0% AP. The
results on different detectors show the generalization ability. Although the additional patch tokens
from foundation models make our Frozen-DETR also have 5 scale feature maps in the encoder,
the added feature map (24 × 24) is much smaller than the C2 feature map in DINO-det-5scale
(333 × 333 for input size 1333 and stride 4). Thus the additional computation costs of Frozen-DETR
(279→400 GFLOPs) are also much smaller than DINO-det-5scale (279→860 GFLOPs). Further,
Frozen-DETR (DINO-det-4scale) and Frozen-DETR (Co-DINO-4scale) also outperform DINO-det-
5scale and Co-DINO-5scale by 1.9% AP. Moreover, we can also increase 0.8% AP when using a
strong backbone Swin-B [49] pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, demonstrating our great scalability. We
find that large objects enjoy the most significant improvement from the image understanding of the
foundation model. For example, there is an improvement of 6.3% APl on the 12 epochs setting
over DINO-det-4scale. We hypothesize that it is because large objects may easily be confused by
the relation between the parts and the whole objects, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a). We also find
that performance gains from more epochs for Frozen-DETR on Co-DINO (+0.3% AP) are less than
Frozen-DETR on DINO-det (+1.3% AP). This is because most SOTA query-based detectors can
converge extremely fast within 12 epochs. Some training strategies are excepted to further improve
the performance with longer training schedules, e.g., large-scale jitter and other data augmentation.

4.4
Dose Frozen-DETR Work under Large Vocabulary Settings?

Closed-set Setting. Since Frozen-DETR has a strong advantage in classification compared with
baselines benefiting from the image understanding of foundation models, we further validate the
effectiveness of Frozen-DETR on the challenging LVIS v1 [26] dataset. LVIS dataset is a large
vocabulary dataset (1203 classes) with long tail distribution. The classes are divided into rare,
common, and frequent classes based on the number of annotations. We choose DINO-det-4scale [66]
as the baseline and train the model for 24 epochs without using mask annotations. Following common
practices, we use repeat factor sampling and Federated Loss [72]. As shown in Table 9, Frozen-DETR

has an impressive improvement of 6.6% AP over DINO-det, demonstrating that the benefit of image
understanding from foundation models is even more significant in the more challenging scenario.
Further, the improvement on rare (+8.7% AP) and common classes (+7.7% AP) is larger than frequent
classes, showing that Frozen-DETR has the potential to alleviate the class imbalance problem.

Open-Vocabulary Setting. As CLIP demonstrates an impressive zero-shot ability, many works [25,
20, 71] aim to inherit its generalization ability to achieve open-vocabulary recognition. In this
subsection, we also validate the open-vocabulary ability inherited by Frozen-DETR. In this setting,
annotations for rare classes are removed and only common and frequent class annotations are used
for training. The AP on rare classes is the main evaluation metric. We follow common practices by
replacing the classifier with class prompts, which are encoded by CLIP text encoder with 80 hand-
crafted prompts, e.g., “a photo of {category} in the scene”. No other distillation methods [25, 63, 38]
or additional datasets [71, 41] are used. As shown in Table 10, since we use CLIP as a frozen feature
enhancer, the open-vocabulary ability is largely inherited. We outperform the baseline DINO-det by
8.8% APr. We also outperform many detectors tailored for open-vocabulary detection, even though it
is not a fair comparison as we use CLIP ViT-L-14-336 and others use CLIP ViT-B-32.

4.5
Combining Multiple Foundation Models

In this subsection, we explore whether combining multiple foundation models can further improve the
performance since image understanding abilities from different aspects may be learned by different
foundation models trained with different pre-tasks. Here we try to combine DINO-det-4scale [66]
with CLIP [54] and DINOv2 [52]. Both foundation models use ViT-L-14-336. We only use the patch
tokens from DINOv2 as another feature map (4+2 = 6 feature maps now). As shown in Table 11, we
can further increase DINO-det to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP), showing that different foundation models
may be complementary in the aspect of image understanding.

4.6
Transfering Frozen-DETR to Other Domains

In the real world, input images always suffer from natural distribution shifts. We also find that Frozen-
DETR inherits great domain generalization ability from frozen foundation models. We directly
transfer the model trained on the COCO dataset to the COCO-O dataset [50] without fine-tuning,
which is a dataset having the same classes as COCO but different domains, such as sketch, weather,
cartoon, painting, tattoo, and handmake. As shown in the Table 12, Frozen-DETR achieves almost
the same performance on both datasets, while other detectors degrade a lot on the COCO-O. The
performance of Frozen-DETR on COCO-O is two times higher than the baselines and even higher
than detectors with strong backbones, showing its strong robustness.

4.7
How does Frozen-DETR work?

To understand how Frozen-DETR works, we conduct error analysis [7] in Table 13. The location
error (Loc) denotes the predictions with correct labels but low IoUs. The classification error (Cls)
denotes the predictions with the correct locations but incorrect labels. The background error (BG)

indicates the detector erroneously marks a background region as an object. The false negative error
(FN) means the detector overlooks some annotated objects.

The results in Table 13 validate that the benefit of CLIP and DINOv2 comes more from high-level
semantic understanding rather than texture details, which is good for classification more than local-
ization. With strong image understanding, the detector can find missing objects (lower false negative
error) and correct wrong classification (lower classification and background error). We also visualize
the feature maps (l2 norm) after the encoder in Figure 4 to better illustrate the benefit. The enhanced
high-level semantic understanding leads to a more complete activation of objects (the first row),
ensuring that objects are detected as complete entities. Further, it allows certain objects to stand out
distinctly against the background (the second row). More visualizations are provided in the Appendix.

Conclusions

In this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be versatile feature enhancers, even though
they are not pre-trained for object detection. We explore a new way to utilize pre-trained foundation
models as a feature enhancer rather than a backbone. Class tokens from them provide a compact
context for decoding object queries in the decoder. Patch tokens further inject semantic details
into feature maps via feature fusion in the encoder. Experiments show that CLIP is one of the best
candidates for Frozen-DETR and the image understanding ability in CLIP can greatly enhance the
classification ability of DETRs, especially in large vocabulary settings. We hope our work can shed
new light on reusing the existing strong foundation models on various downstream tasks.

utilizes foundation models as a plug-and-play module, in which the foundation model is not trainable
and the image size is much smaller than the one in the detector.

In this work, we propose a novel paradigm (comparisons are shown in Figure 5) to integrate frozen
vision foundation models with query-based detectors, firstly showing that frozen foundation models
can be a versatile feature enhancer to boost the performance of detectors, even though they are not
pre-trained for object detection.

In previous practices, large vision foundation models are always used as a pre-trained backbone
and fine-tuned with detectors in an end-to-end manner. Although such a paradigm achieves high
performance, the computation cost of fine-tuning such a large vision foundation model is unaffordable.
We use ViT-L as an example to illustrate this problem, as ViT-L is a common architecture for most
vision foundation models. In the above table, we choose DINO-det-4scale with R50 backbone as the
baseline and compare it with three methods: our Frozen-DETR (CLIP ViT-L-336), DINO-det-5scale,
and DINO-det-4scale with a foundation model (ViT-L) as the backbone. We use the ViT-L as the
backbone following ViTDet. For the training, we use 4 A100 GPUs with 2 images per GPU except
for the ViT-L backbone due to out-of-memory (OOM). For inference, we use a V100 GPU with batch
size 1 in line with the main text. As shown in the Table 14, the computation cost in both training and
inference for Frozen-DETR is the lowest among the three variants.

• Compared with DINO-det-4scale with a foundation model as a backbone, training a ViT-L
backbone needs 4.2 hours per epoch and 44 GB memory per GPU, which is significantly
higher than our Frozen-DETR (1.4 hours and 15 GB with 2 images per GPU). For inference,
using ViT-L as a backbone needs 10 GB GPU memory and runs at 2.1 FPS on a V100 GPU.
While inference with Frozen-DETR only needs 3 GB GPU memory (3x fewer) and runs at
6.5 FPS (3x faster).

• Compared with DINO-det-5scale, our Frozen-DETR not only runs faster but also signifi-
cantly outperforms DINO-det-5scale by 1.8% AP (53.1% AP vs 51.3% AP), as shown in
Table 8.

Thus, Frozen-DETR achieves a good performance-speed trade-off.

Frozen-DETR (CLIP only). Using foundation models can (a) clarify the relation between parts and
the whole object, (b) find missing objects, and (c) correct wrong classifications.

In Figure 6, we show more results with or without the foundation model. With the high-level image
understanding ability from foundation models, the detector can detect objects as completely as
possible, such as the elephant in the first image and the person in the second image. Additionally,
the detector can find some missing objects, e.g. the strange and incomplete dining table in the third
image. Further, with the foundation model, the detector can correctly classify the cell phone rather
than a handbag in the second image and the toy (the toy is not the class in COCO) rather than bottles
in the fourth image.

Do Foundation Models with Registers Further Improve Frozen-DETR?

Registers [15] are used in modern ViTs for mitigating artifacts, which are also helpful for our Frozen-
DETR. Since this work only releases the checkpoint for DINOv2, the following experiments are

conducted on DINOv2 and DINOv2 with registers (DINOv2-reg). In the Table 15, we find that using
DINOv2 as the foundation model can even get better results than using CLIP, which is different
from Table 2. We hypothesize there are two reasons: First, DINOv2 has both global-wise and
token-wise pre-training pre-tasks. Thus the patch tokens are more informative. Further, DINOv2
ViT-L is distilled from ViT-giant, which equals a larger foundation model. Thus equiping the detector
with DINOv2 gets higher performance. Further, we find that DINOv2-reg can mitigate artifacts in
DINOv2 and further improve the performance.

D
Limitations and Broader Impacts

Limitations. This work utilizes the image understanding ability in frozen foundation models.
However, these models are trained on nature images and may not perform well in many challenging
scenarios, e.g., medical images. Although Frozen-DETR enjoys an asymmetric input size, which
greatly reduces computation costs, it still slows down the detector. Distilling Frozen-DETR to a
standard detector may solve the problem and preserve its high performance.

Broader Impacts. This work improves the existing SOTA DETR-like detectors, which can be applied
to automatic driving systems and many other downstream tasks.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The motivation in the paper is clear and the findings can match the motivation
completely.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations are discussed in Section 5 of the main text.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper is an application in object detection and no theoretical result is
included.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide experiment details at the beginning of every subsection in Section
4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

19


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The method proposed in this paper is simple and straightforward. We have
provided detailed configurations to conduct the experiments. And we will release all the
code and models upon acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See the beginning of each subsection in Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

20


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See the beginning of each subsection in Section 4 and the experimental result
tables.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics strictly.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The broader impacts are discussed in Section 5 of the main text.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

21


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pre-trained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [No]
Justification: There is no obvious risk.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite their papers correctly.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will clean the code and provide detailed instructions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
