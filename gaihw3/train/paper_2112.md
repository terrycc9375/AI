Abstract

3D GAN inversion aims to project a single image into the latent space of a 3D Gen-
erative Adversarial Network (GAN), thereby achieving 3D geometry reconstruction.
While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they
are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal
views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse view-
points. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built
on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspec-
tive. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual
encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation
from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework
on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless
stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for
different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized
losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane
discriminator. Experiments reveal that our approach surpasses the existing encoder
training methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Please visit the project page.

Introduction

In the realm of generative models, 2D GANs have gained renown for their remarkable ability to
achieve striking realism through adversarial training, effectively capturing intricate details and textures
to produce visually convincing images, especially on face images [18, 19]. However, their inherent
limitation lies in their lack of depth perception, which restricts their applicability in three-dimensional
contexts. In contrast, 3D GANs mark a groundbreaking advancement by seamlessly integrating
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into their architecture [13, 9, 14, 5]. This integration not only allows
them to match the realism of their 2D counterparts but also ensures consistency in three-dimensional
geometry. While extensive studies have focused on 2D GAN inversion [42, 29, 31, 4, 33, 28], recent
efforts have seen the proposal of inversion methods tailored for 3D GANs [39, 7, 21].

2D GAN inversion techniques focus on projecting the images into the GAN’s natural latent space to
enhance editability and achieve high fidelity to the input image; however, inverting 3D GAN models
presents additional challenges. This process requires accurate 3D reconstruction, which means realis-
tic filling of invisible regions, ensuring coherence and completeness in the resulting three-dimensional
scenes. Recently, inversion methods for 3D GANs have been developed, firstly, optimization-based
and then encoder-based methods. Optimization-based methods [20, 35, 38] employ reconstruction
losses to invert images into a latent code specific to the given view. Furthermore, network parameters
are optimized by generating pseudo-multi-view images from the optimized latent codes to enhance
detail preservation. Such optimization is required for each inference image; it is time-consuming and
requires GPUs with large memory. Therefore, researchers focus on encoder-based methods [39, 7, 21].
While successful inversions are achieved with these methods, they rely on EG3D [9] framework
[39, 7, 21], which is constrained to synthesizing near-frontal views. However, our work utilizes
PanoHead [5], a method capable of rendering full-head image synthesis, enabling a comprehensive
360-degree perspective. This advancement introduces additional challenges, particularly concerning
the invisibility of many parts in the input image. Despite this, the inversion model is expected to
reasonably predict and reconstruct these occluded regions to ensure high-quality 3D reconstruction.
Our experiments demonstrate that extending the methods proposed for EG3D is ineffective.

When projecting images onto PanoHead’s latent space, we observe a trade-off between achieving
high-fidelity reconstruction of the input image and generating realistic representations of the invisible
parts of the head. Some models can perfectly reconstruct the image from a given view but produce
unrealistic outputs when the camera parameters change. Conversely, other models generate realistic
representations under varying camera parameters but fail to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction of the
input image. To achieve high-fidelity reconstruction of the input image and realistic representations
of the invisible parts of the head simultaneously, we train a dual encoder. One encoder specializes in
reconstructing the given view, while the other focuses on generating high-quality invisible views. We
propose stitching the triplane domain generations to produce the final result. This approach combines
the outputs from both encoders to achieve both high-fidelity reconstructions of the given view and
high-quality representations of the invisible parts of the head. To achieve seamless stitching, both
encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason,
we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our
novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. This ensures that both encoders learn to produce
consistent and complementary outputs, enabling seamless stitching of generations for the final result.
Our contributions are as follows:

• To achieve high fidelity to the input and realistic generations for different camera views,
we train dual encoders and introduce a stitching pipeline that combines the best predictions
from both encoders for visible and invisible regions.
• We propose a novel occlusion-aware discriminator that enhances both fidelity and realism.
• We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our framework. Quantitative
and qualitative results show the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art.
Some visual results can be seen in Fig. 1.

While early efforts, such as HoloGAN [24], operating on voxel representations, subsequent works
shifted towards mesh representations [27, 15], and the latest advancements are built around implicit
representations [10, 14, 26, 25]. Among implicit representations, triplane representations have
emerged as a popular choice due to their computational efficiency and the high-quality outputs [9, 13,
5]. The architectures of works like EG3D [9] and PanoHead [5] bear resemblance to the structure
of StyleGAN2 [19]. They consist of mapping and synthesis networks, generating triplanes which
are subsequently projected to a 2D image through volumetric rendering operations akin to those
used in NeRF [23]. While EG3D is trained on the FFHQ [18] dataset with limited angle diversity,
PanoHead achieves a 360-degree perspective in face generation thanks to their dataset selection and
model improvements. In our work, we delve into PanoHead’s latent space and construct our inversion
encoder based on PanoHead.

GAN Inversion. In recent years, GAN inversion, particularly in the context of StyleGAN, has
garnered significant attention due to its extensive editing capabilities. The primary objective of
these studies is to embed an image into StyleGAN’s latent space, enabling subsequent modifications.
Initially, this was approached through latent optimization, where latent codes were iteratively adjusted
using back-propagation to minimize the reconstruction loss between the generated and target images
[11, 1, 2, 19, 30]. For 3D-aware GAN model inversions, supplementary heuristics have been
introduced into the optimization process. These include considerations like facial symmetry [38] and
multi-view optimization strategies [35]. However, such methods are computationally intensive as
they require optimizing each image’s latent codes. Moreover, while minimizing the reconstruction
loss can yield visually similar results, it does not guarantee that the image resides within the natural
latent space of GANs. This distinction is crucial for effective image editing. Without aligning
with StyleGAN’s inherent latent space, reconstructed images may not respond correctly to editing
techniques, thus limiting their practical utility. This consideration also extends to 3D-aware GAN
inversion methods, where encoding geometric information is paramount. Even if an input image
can be faithfully reconstructed, its realism may falter when observed from alternative viewpoints,
emphasizing the importance of aligning with the GAN’s native latent space.

To enhance efficiency, image encoders have been specifically trained for the inversion task, initially
targeting StyleGAN [42, 29, 31, 4, 28, 36, 37], and more recently for EG3D [39, 7, 21]. These
specialized encoders capitalize on insights gained from training datasets to swiftly project images
into latent spaces. Moreover, they can be trained with diverse objectives beyond mere image
reconstruction. For instance, some employ discriminators to compare generated and real images and
latent space discriminators to ensure inversion aligns with the GAN’s natural latent space. As a result,
these methods generally offer faster inversion processes. This study focuses on 3D-GAN inversion,
specifically targeting PanoHead [5]. The task poses significant challenges due to PanoHead’s ability
to capture a comprehensive 360-degree perspective, necessitating the prediction of a substantial
portion of invisible elements by inversion encoders. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained
for EG3D are ineffective in this context.

Overview of PanoHead

Figure 2: Overall architecture of PanoHead.

The overall architecture of PanoHead
is given in Fig. 2.
Resemblant to
EG3D, PanoHead utilizes a mapping
network that takes a random vector z
and the camera conditioning πmapping.
After z is mapped to a w, StyleGAN-
based backbone G generates a tri-grid
triplane. Unlike EG3D, PanoHead’s
triplanes have 3 times the number of
channels in comparison, hence the
name tri-grid. This approach is stated
to ease 360-degree synthesis. The resultant triplane is then rendered via a volumetric neural renderer
R with pose πrender and super-resolved to yield a synthesized image.

3.2
Training an encoder

This section introduces the general pipeline of the encoders employed in our dual-encoder framework.
Each encoder takes an input image I and predicts the latent code w+, which is then passed to the
generator to produce triplane features. These synthesized features are then fed into the renderer to
generate a 2D image with a specified camera parameter πcam, as described by Eq. (1):

w+ = E1(I)

Isv
out = R(G(w+), πcam)
(1)

Here, Isv
out denotes the output rendering for the same view as the input, and E1 represents the encoder.
While the W+ space allows for leveraging priors embedded in the generator, its limited expressive
power in reconstructing image details has been noted due to the information bottleneck of its 14×512
dimensions. To address this limitation, both 2D inversion techniques [33, 28] and 3D GAN inversion
methods [7] permit higher-rate features to pass to the generators, facilitating the capture of fine details.
In 3D GAN inversion methods, these higher-rate features are encoded through a smaller second
network and transmitted to the triplane features. We adopt a similar approach in our encoders. We
refer to the final output as Isv
final. Further details of the architecture are provided in the Appendix.

The primary challenge in this setting arises from establishing appropriate training objective losses,
as our training dataset consists solely of single images, providing ground truth only for the ren-
dered image from the same view as the input. For these output and ground-truth pairs, we set the
usual reconstruction losses, namely, LPIPS perceptual loss [41], L2 reconstruction loss (MSE), and
ArcFace [12] based identity loss as given in Eq. (2):

arg min
E1 LLPIPS(Isv
final, I) + L2(Isv
final, I) + Lidentity(Isv
final, I)
(2)

While models trained with the objective given in Eq. (2) learn to reconstruct a given view, they often
struggle to generalize and produce realistic features from other camera views. Consequently, while
our first encoder is trained with the objective in Eq. (2), we design an adversarial-based loss objective
for our second encoder. This second encoder generates realistic predictions for invisible views, as
explained in Section 3.3.

3.3
Occlusion-aware triplane discriminator

Figure 3: Our training methodology for the triplane discriminator involves generating real samples
by sampling latent vectors Z+ and producing in-domain triplanes using PanoHead. Fake samples
are generated from encoded images. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial loss in enhancing
reconstructions, challenges may persist in achieving high fidelity to the input due to the origin of real
samples from the generator G. To address this, we propose an occlusion-aware discriminator D,
trained exclusively with features from occluded pixels. This ensures that visible regions, such as
frontal views πR, have reduced influence during the training of D.

To achieve a realistic reconstruction of the 3D model, represented in a triplane structure, it is essential
to guide the encoder for visible views and overall coherence. Since we lack one-to-one ground truth

portrait with pose πR, we can perform 360-degree rendering from any given pose πnovel.

to guide the triplane structure, we experiment with various setups incorporating adversarial losses. A
naive approach to utilize adversarial loss would be to render estimated triplanes from other views
and assess the realism of these 2D images using a discriminator. However, our experiments observe
that this setup hinders the model’s ability to learn high fidelity to the input image, as will be further
detailed in Section 5.2. Moreover, randomly rendering different views can only guide limited parts of
the triplane structure rather than the overall.

To overcome this limitation and avoid the computational burden of rendering unnecessary views, we
explore the possibility of training a discriminator in the triplane domain. In our training process for
the triplane discriminator, we follow a procedure where we sample latent vectors Z+ and generate
in-domain triplanes using PanoHead, serving as our real samples. Meanwhile, the fake samples are
triplanes generated from encoded images, as depicted in Fig. 3. Despite the observed improvement
in reconstructions facilitated by this adversarial loss, we note a persistent challenge hindering the
network’s ability to achieve high fidelity to the input. This discrepancy may stem from the real
samples originating from the generator, lacking the detailed feature characteristic of real-world
images. Therefore, this may lead the encoder to omit to encode realistic facial details if they are
absent in the synthesized samples. We propose our occlusion-aware discriminator to overcome
this limitation. This discriminator is exclusively trained with features corresponding to occluded
pixels. This approach ensures that triplane features associated with visible regions, such as a frontal
face, are not utilized for discriminator training. Additionally, we introduce a masking mechanism for
synthesized triplanes to mitigate any distribution mismatch arising between encoded and synthesized
triplanes. This masking process contributes to aligning the distributions of real and fake samples,
further enhancing the coherence of the training dynamics.

We find the set of visible points based on the depth map of the given view via inverse rendering.
Specifically, the occlusion mask OπR is estimated by Eq. (3):

OπR = R3 \ {p[x, y, z] : πRDK−1I[u, v, 1]T }
(3)

where p[x, y, z] is the triplane coordinates, πR is the extrinsic camera parameters of the input view,
D is the depth map from the input view, K is the intrinsic camera parameters, I[u, v, 1] are the
homogeneous coordinates of the input image I rendered from the input view. More clearly, from the
current camera pose, we map back to the depth values to obtain the mask of visible regions (1-OπR).
Then, we invert the visible region mask to obtain OπR. The utilization of occlusion masks has been
previously investigated in 3D methodologies, albeit in different contexts. For instance, they have been
used in generating pseudo-ground truth images to facilitate optimization-based 3D reconstruction [38]
and integrated into passing high-rate residual features to the triplane [39]. However, it is the first
time used in the discriminator. This allows for a selective focus on regions where the encoder may
encounter challenges in faithfully replicating realism.

Compliant with recent advancements in adversarial training, we follow WGAN loss [6] for Ladv
in Eq. (4), where Tsv
final and Tsynth are encoded and Z+ synthesized triplanes, respectively. Details
are given in the Appendix.

Figure 5: Visual results of Encoder 1, Encoder 2, and Dual encoders for the given input images in the
first and sixth columns.

In our approach, we train two encoders: the first, as outlined in Section 3.2, and the second,
augmented with an additional adversarial loss detailed in Section 3.3. While the initial encoder excels
at reconstructing high-fidelity facial images from the input, it often produces unrealistic results for
other viewpoints, as depicted in Fig. 5. Conversely, the second encoder yields better overall outcomes,
albeit with slightly diminished fidelity to the input face.

Our aim is to devise a dual-encoder pipeline that harnesses the strengths of both encoded features.
To achieve this, we leverage the occlusion masks derived in Section 3.3, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
By combining the visible portions from Encoder 1 and the occluded segments from Encoder 2, we
generate our final output, as demonstrated in the last row of Fig. 5.

While each encoder contributes partially to the ultimate feature, achieving seamless integration
necessitates consistency in the output of both encoders despite their distinct specializations. For
instance, if Encoder 1 flawlessly renders a given view of the face but fails to capture the correct
geometry, artifacts may arise in the combined result. Thus, it remains imperative to train both
encoders comprehensively to ensure an overall high-quality outcome.

Experimental Setup

4.1
Training

We combined images of FFHQ [18] and LPFF [34] and split it for training (∼140k) and validation
(∼14k). CelebA-HQ [17] and multi-view MEAD [32] are employed for additional evaluation. We
removed face portrait backgrounds for training and evaluation datasets, applied camera and image
mirroring during training, and performed pose rebalancing proposed in [34] as data augmentation.
We utilized the same dataset to train competitive methods for fair evaluation. The models are trained
for 500k iterations with a batch size of 3 on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The learning rate is 1e−4 for
both encoders and the occlusion-aware discriminator. Ranger is utilized as the optimizer, which is a
combination of Rectified Adam [22] with Lookahead [40].

4.2
Baselines

The baseline models are provided in Table 1. We note that no encoder pipelines are aimed for full
360-degree head reconstruction. We train the models with the author’s released code to invert images
into PanoHead’s latent space.

4.3
Evaluation metrics

We report L2, LPIPS [41] and ID [12] scores for original-view reconstruction, which measure the
fidelity to the input image. For the novel-view quality, we measure Fréchet inception distance
(FID) [16]. Since our validation datasets have limited angle variance, we measure the distance
between 1k randomly synthesized and 1k encoded real-life image distributions. The images are
rendered from varying yaw angles, covering the 360-degree range to include occluded regions. We

also utilize the multi-view image dataset MEAD dataset. Specifically, we fed front MEAD images (0◦
yaw) to all methods, rendered them from novel views of MEAD (from 60◦to 0◦yaw), and compare
them with their corresponding ground truths. This allows us to report LPIPS and ID metrics alongside
the FID metric for the novel views.

Table 1 provides quantitative com-
parisons against state-of-the-art op-

ods. GOAE achieves significantly bet-
ter same-view reconstruction scores
(L2, LPIPS, and ID), however, shows
much worse FID scores, indicat-
ing their inability to produce real-
istic views.
While TriplaneNetv2
achieves similar same-view recon-
struction scores as our method, its FID
score is also significantly worse. Over-
all, the pSp and e4e methods perform worse than ours in all metrics. PTI achieves similar results to
our method but takes ×250 longer and requires a GPU with large memory.

We extend the quantitative analyses to multi-view with the MEAD dataset. Specifically, we feed front
MEAD images (0◦yaw) to all methods, rendered them from novel views of MEAD (from 60◦to
0◦yaw), and compare them with their corresponding ground truths. Table 2 reveals that our method
significantly improves over compared methods especially in LPIPS and ID metrics.

Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 6. The competing methods produce unrealistic outputs
when viewed from angles other than the input view. Among these, PTI achieves good front and side
views but fails to generate realistic hair from the back. Our method achieves the best results overall.

We also include mesh comparisons in Fig. 9. Ours is better than the most recent encoder-based
method [7] and generally performs well compared to PTI. Note that PTI mostly generates smoother
meshes (row 3) but can sometimes struggle depending on the input sample (row 6).

On the other hand, training the model with an
additional adversarial objective that operates on
novel images generated using randomly sam-

but significantly harms the fidelity of the input
image. Training a discriminator in the triplane
domain and applying adversarial losses from
this domain improves overall scores compared
to training the discriminator in the 2D image
domain. However, as seen in Fig. 7 (third row),
the face still lacks high fidelity to the input, and
other views are unrealistic. Lastly, using the
occlusion-aware triplane discriminator improves
identity fidelity and FID scores. The hair looks
more natural, similar to the ones generated by
the model when sampled from z.

In our framework, we chose to embed images

study that explores utilizing different projection
spaces and various combinations of training data.
Training an encoder to project images to the Z or
Z+ space, where Z is sampled 14 times, results
in better FID scores. However, this comes at the
cost of high-fidelity reconstruction. Similarly,
transitioning to a less constrained W+ space
enhances fidelity to the input but worsens the
FID score. Addressing this challenge necessitates additional measures, such as the proposed dual
encoder setup with the occlusion-aware discriminator objective. It is important to note that the
distinction between the Z+ and W+ space arises from the camera parameters incorporated into
the mapping network. While Z+ employs various samples of Z, it adheres to the same set of
camera parameters assigned to the mapping network. In contrast, the W+ space does not impose

limited camera poses, typically front-view faces, we investigate training the encoder with synthetically
generated images from PanoHead. However, solely utilizing synthetic images generated from samples
of Z+ to introduce more diversity compared to Z leads to poor performance on real image validation
sets regarding reconstruction quality. When combining synthetic and real images, we observe an
improvement compared to using them individually.

also producing FID scores very similar to those of Encoder 2.

5.3
Editing application

We follow the reference-based editing in [8] in our pipeline. This method encodes input images, and
edits are performed in the triplane space. This approach utilizes the fact that triplanes have a canonical
space, allowing for the transfer of local parts from one triplane to another. Fig. 10 demonstrates a
successful transfer of hairstyle from a reference image to the target human in 3D. Another advantage
of encoder-based models over the optimization ones is the feasibility of such applications. For
example, this would not be possible with PTI since the generator is fine-tuned for each sample,
preventing the copying of features from one image to another in the encoded feature space.

Conclusion and Broader Impacts

Figure 11: Example failure cases. Inputs (first), reconstructions (second), and novel views.

In summary, this study introduces a 3D GAN inversion framework that projects single images into
the latent space of a 3D GAN for accurate 3D geometry reconstruction. While prior encoders
excel at synthesizing near-frontal views, they struggle with diverse 3D scenes, motivating our
exploration of alternatives. Using PanoHead’s 360-degree synthesis, we developed a dual encoder
system for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic multi-view generation. A stitching mechanism
in the triplane domain ensures optimal predictions from both encoders. With specialized losses,
including an occlusion-aware triplane discriminator, our framework achieves superior qualitative
and quantitative performance over existing methods.

Broader Impacts. Our framework has the potential to revolutionize the movie industry, AR, and VR,
enabling applications like animating portraits and creating realistic game environments. However, it
raises ethical concerns, particularly the risk of "deep fakes". We stress the need for safeguards to
ensure the ethical use of this technology.

Limitations. We acknowledge that there is room for improvements in the fidelity of images, the
realism and 3D-consistency of generations (see Fig. 11, row 2), and the smoothness of the meshes
(see Fig. 9). Since the projection is made onto the latent space of PanoHead, our method may not
handle out-of-domain or tail samples well (such as images with high-frequency details or accessories).
For instance, our method struggles with hats, as demonstrated in the first row of Fig. 11. We
recognize that, in certain cases, the artifacts are visible in the back middle of the head and are more
noticeable in the mesh rendering as shown in Fig. 9. Additional research is required.

Encoder 1 and 2.
For our Encoder 1 and 2, we em-
ploy 2-stage encoding for W+ and high-rate F features, also
seen in common with other style-based encoder methods [29,
3, 4, 39, 7].
We opted for the architecture in [29] for
W+ stage (GradualStyleEncoder) and in [7] for F stage
(TriplanenetEncoder), both for Encoder 1 and 2.

Ablation encoders. GradualStyleEncoder is used for the Z+
encoder, where resulting 14 latent vectors are later passed through
the mapping network with truncation ψ = 0.85 and canonical
front camera pose. However, for the Z encoder, a smaller varia-
tion of [29] (BackboneEncoderUsingLastLayerIntoW) is im-
plemented. This choice is due to Z being less expressive compared
to Z+ (1 dim vs. 14 dim) and hence a smaller encoder being suf-
ficient. The same mapping network parameters for the Z+ case
are also utilized for Z encoder outputs.

Occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. We follow a feedfor-
ward network approach with a channel bottleneck for our tri-
plane discriminator D (Table 6). Noting that the occluded tri-
plane dimensions are [batch_size,3,96,256,256], we first
add each depth slice to the channel dimension to get the input
shape as [batch_size,288,256,256]. Output dimensions are
[batch_size,1]. We do not utilize saturating functions such as sigmoid at the end since WGAN-
based loss [6] is utilized.

Ablation image discriminator. For the back-view image discriminator used in ablations, we change
the input channel number of the model in Table 6 from 288 to 3.

Training objectives and hyperparameters

The training objective for Encoder 1 with parameters θE1 is given in Eq. (5).

Isv = R(G(E1(I)), π)
arg min
θE1
λ1LLPIPS(Isv, I) + λ2L2(Isv, I) + λ3Lidentity(Isv, I)
(5)

where Isv is the same-view reconstruction of I with pose π. Coefficients are set as λ1 = 0.8,
λ2 = 1.0, λ3 = 0.5.

The training objective for Encoder 2 with parameters θE2 is given in Eq. (6).

Tenc = G(E2(I))
Isv = R(Tenc, π)
arg min
θE2
λ1LLPIPS(Isv, I) + λ2L2(Isv, I) + λ3Lidentity(Isv, I) + λ4Ladv(D(OπTenc))
(6)

where Tenc is the encoded triplane of image I, D is the discriminator, Oπ is the occlusion mask from
the same view π. λ1,2,3 are the same as in Eq. (5), and λ4 = 0.001. Ladv in Eq. (6) is given in Eq. (7):

Ladv(x) = softplus(−x)
(7)

where softplus is a smooth and differentiable approximation to ReLU.

The training objective for discriminator D with parameters θD is given in Eq. (8).

Tsynth = G(M(z+ ∼N(0, I14), πfront))
arg min
θD
λLadv(D(OπTenc), D(OπTsynth))
(8)

where Tsynth is the synthesised triplane from randomly sampled z+, M is the mapping network, πfront
is the canonical front pose. Ladv in Eq. (8) is given in Eq. (9):

Ladv(x, y) = softplus(−x) + softplus(y)
(9)

λ is set as 0.5.

We jointly train Encoder 2 and discriminator D in a traditional adversarial fashion. We further employ
R1-regularization to encourage L1-lipschitzness [6] to justify using softplus, where its weighting
coefficient is 10 and is applied every 16 iterations.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our claims include utilizing dual encoders trained to specialize in visible
and occluded regions, along with a stitching pipeline that seamlessly combines the most
accurate predictions from both encoders. To further enhance the reconstruction of occluded
regions, we propose an occlusion-aware discriminator, enabling the image encoder to
generate realistic features for these challenging areas. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across multiple
benchmarks and scenarios.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitations are given in Sec. 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The training and evaluation schemes are detailed in Sections 4.1 and 4.3
and Appendix A, which provides reproducability.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The paper does not provide open access to the code as of now; however, the
datasets are public and can be obtained from the pointed references. The code is planned to
be released through the project page provided in Abstract.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Training objectives are given in Eqs. (2) and (4), the training recipe in Sec-
tion 4.1, and the evaluation metrics in Section 4.3. Further details about the experimental
setup are provided in Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not provide error bars due to the computational budget it would require.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Time of execution of methods are provided in Table 1, as well as the computing
resources in Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Broader impacts are provided in Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

26


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe the potential risks in Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We properly mentioned the original owners of previous work via references,
and complied with the licenses.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

27


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not share new assets as of now.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper neither involves crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

28


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
