Abstract

Camera-LiDAR fusion models significantly enhance perception performance in
autonomous driving. The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modal-
ity while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR
fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we
argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones
into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across
modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing
pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they
struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-
LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR
fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality
Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each
modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality
parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked
backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other
modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant
parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters
can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative
Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when
certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models,
and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning
methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.

Introduction

Camera-LiDAR fusion models are prevalent in autonomous driving, effectively leveraging the
sensor properties, including the accurate geometric data from LiDAR point clouds and the rich
semantic context from camera images [1, 2], providing a more comprehensive understanding of the
environment [3, 4]. However, the exponential increase in parameter counts due to fusion architectures
introduces significant computational costs, especially when deploying these systems on resource-

Figure 1: Motivating example of fusion-redundant features in the 3D object detection task. We
employ backward propagation on camera-LiDAR fusion models with pre-trained backbones to
observe the gradient difference (features utilization) between with camera backbone only and with
both the camera and LiDAR backbone. Notably, certain pre-trained parameters in the camera
backbone are redundant due to the amendment of LiDAR information. It reveals that similar feature
extraction exists across modalities, which introduces additional redundancy when camera-LiDAR
fusion models directly loads single-modal pre-trained backbones.

constrained edge devices, which is a crucial challenge for autonomous driving [5]. Network pruning
is one of the most attractive methods for addressing the challenge above of identifying and eliminating
redundancy in models. Existing pruning algorithms target single-modal models [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
or multi-modal models that merge distinct types of data [13, 14], such as visual and language inputs.
However, it’s important to note that directly applying these algorithms to camera-LiDAR fusion
models can lead to significant performance degradation. The degradation can be reasoned for two
main factors that existing pruning methods overlooked: 1) the key fusion mechanism specific to vision
sensor inputs within models, and 2) the training scheme where models typically load single-modal
pre-trained parameters onto each backbone [2, 15]. Specifically, since single-modality models lack
the cross-modality fusion mechanism, existing pruning algorithms traditionally do not consider inter-
modality interactions. Furthermore, because the pre-trained backbones (image or LiDAR) are trained
separately, they are not optimized jointly, exacerbating the redundancy in features extracted from each
backbone. Though leveraging pre-trained backbone improves the training efficiency compared with
models training from scratch, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and
LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across
modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism.

In detail, since backbones are independently pre-trained on single-modal datasets, they extract features
comprehensively, which leads to similar feature extraction across modalities. Meanwhile, the fusion
mechanism selectively leverages reliable features while minimizing weaker ones across modalities
to enhance model performance. This selective utilization upon similar feature extraction across
modalities introduces the additional redundancy: Each backbone independently extracts similar
features, which subsequent fusion modules will not potentially utilize. For instance, both camera
and LiDAR backbones extract geometric features to predict depth during pre-training. However,
geometric features extracted from the LiDAR backbone are considered more reliable during fusion
because LiDAR input data contain more accurate geometric information than the cameras, e.g., object
distance, due to the physical properties of sensors. Consequently, this leads to the redundancy of
geometric features of the camera backbone. In summary, similar feature extraction across modalities,
coupled with the following selective utilization in fusion modules, leads to two counterparts of similar
features across modalities: those utilized by fusion modules in one modality (i.e., fusion-contributed),
and those that are redundant in the other modality (i.e., fusion-redundant). We also illustrate the
fusion-redundant features in Figure 1.

To address the above challenge, we propose a novel pruning framework AlterMOMA, specifically
designed for camera-LiDAR fusion models to identify and prune fusion-redundant parameters.
AlterMOMA employs alternative masking on each modality, followed by observing loss changes
when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. These observations serve as important
indications to identify fusion-redundant parameters, which are integral to our importance scores
evaluation function, AlterEva. Specifically, the camera and LiDAR backbones are alternatively
masked. During this process, the absence of fusion-contributed features and relevant parameters in
the masked (deactivated) backbone compels the fusion modules to reactivate their fusion-redundant

counterparts from the other backbone. Throughout this reactivation, changes in loss are observed
as indicators for contributed and fusion-redundant parameters across modalities. These indicators
are then combined in AlterEva to maximize the importance scores of contributed parameters while
minimizing the scores of fusion-redundant parameters. Then, parameters with low importance scores
will be pruned to reduce computational costs.

To validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, extensive experiments are conducted on
several popular 3D perception datasets with camera and LiDAR sensor data, including nuScenes [16]
and KITTI [17]. These datasets encompass a range of 3D autonomous driving tasks, including 3D
object detection, tracking, and segmentation.

The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) We propose a pruning framework AlterMOMA to
effectively compress camera-LiDAR fusion models 2) we propose an importance score evaluation
function AlterEva, which identifies fusion-redundant features and their relevant parameters across
modalities 3) we validate the effectiveness of the proposed AlterMOMA on nuScenes and KITTI for
3D detection and segmentation tasks.

Camera-LiDAR Fusion. With the advancement of autonomous driving technology, the efficient
fusion of diverse sensors, particularly cameras and LiDARs, has become crucial [18, 19]. Fusion
architectures can be categorized into three types based on the stage of fusion within the learning
framework: early fusion [20, 21], late fusion [22], and intermediate fusion [2, 3, 15]. Current state-
of-the-art (SOTA) fusion models evolve primarily within intermediate fusion and combine low-level
machine-learned features from each modality to yield unified detection results, thus significantly
enhancing perception performance compared with early or late fusion. Specifically, camera-LiDAR
fusion models focus on aligning the camera and LiDAR features through dimension projection at
various levels, including point [23], voxel [24], and proposal [3]. Notably, the SOTA fusion paradigm
aligns all data to the bird’s eye view (BEV) [2, 4, 15, 25, 26], has gained traction as an effective
approach to maximize the utilization of heterogeneous data types.

Network Pruning. Network pruning effectively compresses deep models by reducing redundant
parameters and decreasing computational demands. Pruning algorithms have been well-explored for
single-modal perception tasks [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], focusing on evaluating importance scores to
identify and remove redundant parameters or channels. These scores are based on data attributes [7,
33], weight norms [34, 35], or feature map ranks [28]. However, single-modal pruning algorithms are
not suited for the complexities of camera-LiDAR fusion models. While some multi-modal pruning
algorithms exist [13, 14], they are mainly designed for models combining different data types like
language and vision. Therefore, there is a pressing need for pruning algorithms specifically devised
for camera-LiDAR fusion models. From the perspective of granularity, pruning algorithms can be
divided into two primary categories: 1) structured pruning, which entails removing entire channels or
rows from parameter matrices, and 2) unstructured pruning, which focuses on eliminating individual
parameters. For practical applications, we have adapted our method to support both types of pruning.

3.1
Preliminaries

We firstly review some basic concepts including camera-LiDAR fusion models and pruning formula-
tion. Camera-LiDAR fusion models consist of 1) a LiDAR feature extractor Fl to extract features
from point cloud inputs, 2) a camera feature extractor Fc to extract features from image inputs, 3) the
fusion module and following task heads Ff to get the final task results. The parameters denote as θ =
{ θl, θc, θf } for LiDAR backbone, camera backbone, and fusion and task heads, respectively. Take
camera backbone for instance, θc = {θ1
c, θ2
c, ..., θNc
c } denotes all weights in the camera backbone,
where Nc represents the total number of parameters in camera backbone. Therefore, for the LiDAR
input Xl and camera input Xc, the training process of models could be denoted as

arg min
θl,c,f L(Y, Ff(θf; Fl(θl; Xl), Fc(θc; Xc)),
(1)

where Y denotes the ground truth, and L represents the task-specific loss functions.

Figure 2: Overview of the AlterMOMA : The framework begins with Modality Masking, where
one of the backbones is initially masked. This step is followed by Redundancy Reactivation and
Importance Evaluation, where the parameter importance scores are initially calculated with AlterEva.
Afterward, the models undergo Reinitialization and Alternative Masking of the other backbone,
leading to another round of Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation. When scores
of all parameters in backbones are calculated fully with AlterEva (detailed in Section 3.3), models
are pruned to remove parameters with low importance scores and then finetuned. Notably, we use
black lines to represent parameters of models and red lines to represent reactivated fusion-redundant
parameters. The thickness of these lines indicates the contribution of parameters.

Importance-based pruning typically involves using metrics to evaluate the importance scores of
parameters or channels. Subsequently, optimization methods are employed to prune the parameters
with lower importance scores, that are nonessential within the model. For the camera-LiDAR fusion
models, the optimization process can be formulated as follows:

Overview of Alternative Modality Masking Pruning

Similar feature extraction across modalities, coupled with the selective utilization of features in the
following fusion modules introduce redundancy in camera-LiDAR fusion models. Therefore, similar
features and their relevant parameters can be categorized into two counterparts across modalities:
those that contribute to fusion and subsequent task heads (fusion-contributed), and those that are
redundant (fusion-redundant). In this section, we propose the pruning framework AlterMOMA,
which alternatively employs masking on camera and Lidar backbones to identify and remove the
fusion-redundant parameters. AlterMOMA is developed based on a novel insight: "The absence
of fusion-contributed features will compel fusion modules to ’reactivate’ their fusion-redundant
counterparts as supplementary, which, though less effective, are necessary to maintain functionality."
For instance, if the LiDAR backbone is masked, the previously fusion-contributed geometric features
it provided are absent. To fulfill the need for accurate position predictions, the model still needs to
process geometric features. Consequently, the fusion module is compelled to utilize the geometric
features from the unmasked camera backbone, which were previously fusion-redundant. We refer to
this process as Redundancy Reactivation. By observing changes during this Redundancy Reactivation,
fusion-redundant parameters can be identified. The overview of AlterMOMA is shown in Figure 2,
and the detailed steps are in Algorithm 1 of Appendix D. The key steps are introduced as follows:

Modality Masking. Three binary masks are denoted as µl, µc, and µf ∈{0, 1}, correspond to the
parameters applied separately on the LiDAR backbone, the camera backbone, and the fusion and

tasks head. Our framework begins by masking either one of the camera backbones or the LiDAR
backbone. Here we take masking the LiDAR backbone as the illustration. The masks are with µl = 0,
µc = 1, µf = 1. The camera backbone will be masked alternatively.

Redundancy Reactivation. To allow masked models to reactivate fusion-redundant parameters, we
train masked models with batches of data. Specifically, B batches of data Di, i ∈{1, 2, ..., B} are
sampled from the multi-modal dataset D.

Importance Evaluation. After Redundancy Reactivation, the importance scores of parameters in the
camera backbones are calculated with our proposed importance score evaluation function AlterEva
detailed in Section 3.3. Since fusion modules need to consider the reactivation of both modalities,
the importance scores of parameters in the fusion module and task heads will be updated once the
importance scores of both the camera and Lidar backbones’ parameters are calculated.

Alternative Masking. After Importance Evaluation of camera modality, models will reload the
initialized parameters, and then the other backbone will alternatively be masked, with µl = 1, µc = 0,
µf = 1. Then the step Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation will be processed again
to update the importance scores of parameters in the LiDAR backbone and the fusion module.

Pruning with AlterEva. After evaluating the importance scores using AlterEva, parameters with
low importance scores are pruned with a global threshold determined by the pruning ratio. Once the
pruning is finished, the model is fine-tuned with the task-specific loss, as indicated in Eqn. 1.

3.3
Alternative Evaluation

In this section, we will detail the formulation of our proposed AlterEva, which consists of two distinct
indicators to evaluate the parameter importance scores. As outlined in section 3.2, the importance
scores are alternatively calculated with AlterEva in Importance Evaluation. Then, parameters with low
importance scores are removed in the pruning process. The goal of AlterEva is to maximize the scores
of parameters that contribute to task performance while minimizing the scores of fusion-redundant
parameters. To achieve this, AlterEva incorporates two key indicators: 1) Deactivated Contribution
Indicator (DeCI) evaluate the parameter contribution to the overall task performance of the fusion
models, 2) Reactivated Redundancy Indicator (ReRI) identifies fusion-redundant parameters across
both modalities. Since changes in loss can directly reflect the parameter contribution difference to
task performance during alternative masking, both indicators are designed based on the observation of
loss decrease or increase, when certain modality parameters are activated or deactivated. Specifically,
take parameters in the camera backbone as an instance, DeCI observe the loss increases with masking
camera backbone itself, while ReRI observe loss decrease with masking LiDAR backbone and
reactivating camera backbone via Redundancy Reactivation. Formally, we formulate the loss for the
fusion models with masks. With three binary masks and the dataset defined in Section 3.2, the loss is
denoted as follows, by simplifying some of the extra notations used in Eqn. 1:

Lm(µc, µl, µf; D) = L(µl ⊙θl, µc ⊙θc, µf ⊙θf; D).
(3)

For brevity, we assume µc = 1, µl = 1, and µf = 1, and we only specify in the formulation when
a mask is zero. For example, Lm(µc = 0; D) indicates that µc = 0, µf = 1 and µl = 1. Since the
alternative masking is performed on both backbones, we illustrate our formulation by calculating two
indicators for parameters in the camera backbone.

Deactivated Contribution Indicator. If a parameter is important and contributes to task performance,
deactivating this parameter will lead to task performance degradation, which will be reflected in an
increase in loss. Therefore, to derive the contribution of the i-th parameter θi
c of the camera backbone,
we observe the changes in loss when this parameter is deactivating via masking, denoted as follows:

ˆΦθic = |Lm(; D) −Lm(µi
c = 0; D)|,
(4)

where µi
c represents the mask for θi
c, and ˆΦθi
c denotes the indicator DeCI for θi
c. However, the total
number of parameters is enormous, deactivating and evaluating each parameter independently are
computationally intractable. Therefore, we design an alternative efficient method to approximate the
evaluation in Eqn. 4 by leveraging the Taylor first-order expansion inspired by [36]. We first observe
the loss changes |Lm(; D) −Lm(µc = 0; D)| by deactivating the entire camera backbones. Then,
the first-order approximation of evaluation in Eqn. 4 is calculated by expanding the loss change in
each individual parameter θi
c with Taylor expansion, considering θc = {θ1
c, ..., θNc
c }. This method

5


---Page Break---
allows us to estimate the contribution for each parameter, denoted as follows:

ˆΦθic =
Lm(; D) + µi
c ⊙θi
c · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θic
−Lm(µc = 0; D) −µi
c ⊙θi
c · ∂Lm(µc = 0; D)

∂θic

.
(5)

When θc is deactivating with µc = 0, µi
c = 0 for i ∈{1, ..., N c}, which means that the last term of
Eqn. 5 is zero. Meanwhile, when considering importance scores on a global scale, the Lm(; D) and
Lm(µc = 0; D) can be treated as constant for all θi
c. Thus the first term and the third term can be
disregarded. Therefore, the final indicator of each parameter’s contribution, represented by our DeCI,
can be expressed as follows:
ˆΦθic =
θi
c · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θic

.
(6)

This formulation enables tractable and efficient computation without Modality Masking of the camera
backbone itself, achieved by performing a single backward propagation in the Importance Evaluation
with initialized parameters.

Reactivated Redundancy Indicator. As discussed in Section 3.2, the identification of fusion-
redundant parameters relies on our understanding of the fusion mechanism: when fusion-contributed
features from the LiDAR backbone are absent due to masking, the previously fusion-redundant
counterparts and their relevant parameters from the camera backbone will be reactivated during
the Redundancy Reactivation. Therefore, to reactivate and identify fusion-redundant parameters
in the camera backbone, the Modality Masking of the LiDAR backbone (µl = 0) and Redundancy
Reactivation are processed first. Throughout this process, the loss evolves from Lm(µl = 0; D1) to
Lm(µl = 0; DB), and the parameters evolve from θc,0 (i.e. θc) to θc,B. Similar to the formulation of
DeCI, we observe the decrease in loss during Redundancy Reactivation and refer to this observation
as our ReRI, denoted as follows:
˜Φθc = |Lm(µl = 0; D) −Lm(µl = 0; D1) + ... + Lm(; DB−1) −Lm(µl = 0; DB)|
= |Lm(µl = 0; D) −Lm(µl = 0; DB)|.
(7)

Specifically, this process is designed to identify parameters that contribute to the task performance of
models with the masked LiDAR backbone, highlighting those that are fusion-redundant. Since we
want to observe reactivation rather than parameters updating of this masked model across training
batches, we apply the first-order Taylor expansion to the initial i-th parameters θi
c,0, denoted as:

˜Φθi
c,0 =
Lm(µl = 0; D) + µi
c ⊙θi
c,0 · ∂Lm(µl = 0; D)

∂θi
c,0

−Lm(µl = 0; DB) −µi
c ⊙θi
c,0 · ∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

∂θi
c,0

.
(8)

To derive the gradient on initial parameters θi
c,0 of the last term, we could use the chain rule and write
out based on the gradient of the last step,

∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

∂θi
c,0
· θi
c,0 = ∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

c,j−1
· θi
c,0 ≈∂Lm(µl = 0, DB)

∂θi
c,B
· θi
c,0.
(9)

According to the Proposition A in the Appendix A, this approximation is reached by dropping some
small terms with sufficiently small learning rates [9]. Since θi
c is activating with µi
c = 1, and the
Lm(µl = 0; D) and Lm(µc = 0; DB) can be treated as constant for all θi
c, we could denote our final
formulation by simplifying Eqn. 8, and denoted as follow:

˜Φθic =
θi
c · ∂Lm(µl = 0; D)

∂θic
−θi
c · ∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

∂θi
c,B

,
(10)

where θi
c is the θi
c,0 and ˜Φθic represent the ReRI for θi
c.

To the goal of parameters with significant contributions maintaining high importance scores while
those identified as fusion-redundant are assigned lower scores, AlterEva calculate the final importance
scores by subtracting ReRI from DeCI. Since DeCI of parameters in the camera backbone could
be calculated without masking the camera backbone itself, DeCI and ReRI of camera parameters
could be calculated in the same alternative masking stage (with LiDAR backbone masking), which
simplifies the process of our framework AlterMOMA. Therefore, with the combination Eqn. 6 and
Eqn. 10, the AlterEva of the camera backbones could be presented with the normalization:

S(θi
c) = α ·
ˆΦθic
PNc
j=0 ˆΦθj

−β ·
˜Φθic

(11)

---Page Break---
where α and β are the hyper parameters and S(θi
c) represent the importance score evaluation function
AlterEva for θi
c. Similarly, the AlterEva of parameters in the LiDAR backbones (i.e. θl) and in the
fusion modules (i.e. θf ) could be derived as:

S(θi
l) = α ·
ˆΦθi

where ˜Φθi

f (µc = 0) is calculated when camera backbone is masking, while ˜Φθi
f (µl = 0)
is calculated with LiDAR backbone masking. AlterEva can efficiently calculate importance scores
with backward propagation, enhancing the tractability of AlterMOMA. For brevity, we omit the
derivations related to parameters in the LiDAR backbone and fusion modules, but additional details
are available in Appendix B and Appendix C.

Experimental Results

4.1
Baseline Models and Datasets

To validate the efficacy of our proposed framework, empirical evaluations were conducted on several
camera-LiDAR fusion models, including the two-stage detection models AVOD-FPN [3], as well as
the end-to-end architecture based on BEV space, such as BEVfusion-mit [15] and BEVfusion-pku [2].
For AVOD-FPN, the point cloud input is processed using a voxel grid representation, while all input
views are extracted using a modified VGG-16 [37]. Notably, the experiment on the AVOD-FPN
demonstrates the efficiency of AlterMOMA on two-stage models, although this isn’t the SOTA
fusion architecture for recent 3D perception tasks. Current camera-LiDAR fusion models are moving
towards a unified architecture that extracts camera and LiDAR features within a BEV space. Thus,
our primary results focus on BEV-based unified architectures, specifically BEVfusion-mit [15] and
BEVfusion-pku [2]. We conducted tests using various backbones. For camera backbones, we included
Swin-Transformer (Swin-T) [38] and ResNet [39]. For LiDAR backbones, we used SECOND [18],
VoxelNet [40] and PointPillars [41].

We perform our experiments for both 3D object detection and BEV segmentation tasks on the
KITTI [17] and nuScenes [16], which are challenging large-scale outdoor datasets devised for
autonomous driving tasks. The KITTI dataset contains 14,999 samples in total, including 7,481
training samples and 7,518 testing samples, with a comprehensive total of 80,256 annotated objects.
To adhere to standard practice, we split the training samples into a training set and a validation
set in approximately a 1:1 ratio and followed the difficulty classifications proposed by KITTI,
involving easy, medium, and hard. NuScenes is characterized by its comprehensive annotation scenes,
encompassing tasks including 3D object detection, tracking, and BEV map segmentation. Within

Implementation Details

We conducted the 3D object detection and segmentation experiments with MMdetection3D [42] on
NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. To ensure fair comparisons, consistent configurations of hyperparameters
were employed across different experimental groups. To train the 3D object detection baselines, we
utilize Adam as the optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. We employ Cosine Annealing as the
parameter scheduler and set the batch size to 2. For BEV segmentation tasks, we employ Adam as
the optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4. We utilize the one-cycle learning rate scheduler and set the
batch size to 2. The hyperparameters α and β in Section 3.3 are both set with 1. The baseline pruning
methods include IMP [43], SynFlow [44], SNIP [35], and ProsPr [9], with the hyperparameters
specified in their papers respectively.

Experimental Results on Unstructured Pruning

To evaluate the efficiency of AlterMOMA with unstructured pruning, we conduct experiments
across multiple fusion architectures and datasets for 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.
Specifically, to evaluate the efficiency of AlterMOMA on two-stage fusion architectures, we applied
AlterMOMA to AVOD-FPN [3], using the KITTI dataset with the task of 3D detection. Besides,
BEVfusion-mit [15] and BEVfusion-pku [2], as two representative camera-LiDAR fusion models
with unified BEV-based architectures, are applied with AlterMOMA using the nuScenes dataset
to validate the efficiency on both 3D detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Additionally, to
validate the robustness of AlterMOMA with various backbones, we conducted experiments with
alternative images and point backbone, including ResNet [39] and PointPillars [41].

3D Object detection on nuScenes with BEV-based fusion Architectures. The experimental
results are presented in Table 1. Note that baseline models are BEVfusion-mit trained with SwinT
and VoxelNet backbone. As reported in Table 1, single-modal pruning methods, including IMP,
SynFlow, SNIP, and ProsPr, experience significant declines in accuracy performance. Even the ProsPr,
considered the best-performing method among these single-modal pruning techniques, demonstrates
the mAP decrease of 3.5% in accuracy at the 80% pruning ratio and 9.2% at the 90% pruning ratio
on BEVfusion-mit. Conversely, the incorporation of our AlterMOMA yielded promising results.
For example, comparing with the baseline pruning method ProsPr, AlterMOMA boosts the mAP of
BEVfusion-mit by 3.0% (64.3% →67.3%), 3.6% (61.9% →65.5%), and 4.9% (58.6% →63.5%) for
the three different pruning ratios. Similarly, AlterMOMA obtains much higher mAP and NDS than
the other four pruning baselines with different pruning ratios on BEVFusion-mit and BEVFusion-pku.

3D Object detection on KITTI with the two-stage fusion architecture. To validate the efficiency
of AlterMOMA on the two-stage detection fusion architecture, we conduct experiments with various
pruning ratios on KITTI with AVOD-FPN architecture as the baseline. The experimental results
are presented in Table 2. Specifically, Table 2 presents the results for the car class on the KITTI,
detailing AP-3D and AP-BEV across various difficulty levels including easy, moderate, and hard.
Existing pruning methods experience significant declines in performance on different metrics of
different difficulties. Even the best-performing method among single-modal pruning methods,
ProPr, shows a decrease in AP-3D of 3.5%, 2.6%, and 4.4% in the easy, moderate, and hard
difficulty levels, respectively, at the 80% pruning ratio. Conversely, the AlterMOMA has yielded

promising results. For instance, comparing with the pruning method ProsPr, AlterMOMA enhances
both the AP-3D and AP-BEV on AVOP-FPN by 3.2% (74.2% →77.4%) and 3.9% (81.2% →
85.3%) for easy difficulties at the 90% pruning ratio. Furthermore, AlterMOMA consistently
outperforms the other four pruning baselines across various difficulties and pruning ratios on AVOD-
FPN. The comprehensive experimental results on 3D object detection validate the effectiveness of
our AlterMOMA across different camera-LiDAR fusion architectures.

3D Semantic Segmentation on nuScenes To validate the robustness of our work, we extend our
performance evaluation of AlterMOMA to the semantic-centric BEV map segmentation task. Note
that baseline models are BEVfusion-mit trained with SwinT and VoxelNet backbone. We use the
nuScenes dataset and utilize the BEV map segmentation validation set. The pivotal evaluation metric
for this task is the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). with the experimental configuration detailed
in the work by [15], we perform our evaluation on the BEVfusion-mit, as shown in Table 3. We
observed that existing pruning methods still meet a significant accuracy drop by 8.6% (IMP), 5.3%
(SynFlow), 5.9% (SNIP), and 4.1% (ProsPr) for the 80% pruning ratio. Alternatively, our proposed
approach yields significant advancements in performance. Specifically, compared with the ProsPr,
AlterMOMA achieves a substantial enhancement by 3.0% (57.7% →60.7%), 3.0% (56.2% →
59.2%), and 3.6% (54.1% →57.7%) for the three different pruning ratios. These results empirically
prove the efficacy of our pruning algorithms when applied to the BEV map segmentation task.

Results on Various Backbone Architectures To comprehensively assess the efficacy of AlterMOMA,
we conducted experiments with alternative images and point backbones which will influence fusion.
Specifically, we replaced the original VoxelNet backbone with PointPillar and the SwinT backbone
with ResNet101 on the architecture of BEVFusion-mit. As depicted in Table 4, the results obtained
from these experiments consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with various pruning
ratios. Particularly noteworthy is the achievement of substantial 1.6%, 3.1%, and 4.2% improvement
compared to the ProsPr baseline under the pruning ratio of 80%, 85% and 90%. This consistent
improvement is observed across different pruning ratios, affirming the effectiveness of AlterMOMA
with different backbones employed. These outcomes robustly demonstrate the general applicability
of AlterMOMA to various backbone architectures.

Structure Pruning Results on 3D object Detection

To assess the efficacy of our proposed pruning approach in structure pruning, we conducted experi-
ments with BEVfusion-mit models with ResNet101 as the camera backbone and SECOND as the
LiDAR backbones. Specifically, We measured the performance of the pruned networks with a similar
amount of FLOP reductions and reported the number of FLOPs(‘GFLOPs’). As depicted in Table 5,
the results obtained from these experiments consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
with various pruning sparsities. Our evaluations at 30% and 50% pruning sparsities reveal that Alter-
MOMA not only maintains a competitive mAP and NDS but also achieves a substantial reduction in
computational overhead. Notably, with the 30% pruning sparsities, AlterMOMA achieves a 0.7% on
mAP and 0.5% on NDS compared with the unpruned baseline models, which reveals that removing
similar feature redundancy improves the efficiency of models. Specifically, compared with the ProsPr
baseline, AlterMOMA achieves a substantial enhancement by 1.1% (64.6% →65.3%), and 2.0%
(62.5% →64.5%), for the two different pruning sparsities.

Discussion and Conclusion

Although our approach identifies similar feature redundancy in camera-LiDAR fusion models,
it is limited to the perception field. Extending it to other multi-modal models, such as vision-
language models, requires further research. Fusion modules across various modalities exhibit
different functionalities. In multi-sensor fusion models (camera, LiDAR, and Radar), the focus is
on supplementing and spatially aligning data by leveraging the sensors’ physical properties, fusing
low-level features. However, in models with disparate data types like vision and language, fusion
modules focus on matching high-level semantic contexts. Therefore, AlterMOMA primarily addresses
redundancy from supplementary functionality in multi-sensor fusion perception architectures.

In this paper, we explore the computation reduction of camera-LiDAR fusion models. A pruning
framework AlterMOMA is introduced to address redundancy in these models. AlterMOMA employs
alternative masking on each modality and observes loss changes when certain modality parameters
are activated and deactivated. These observations are integral to our importance scores evaluation
function AlterEva. Through extensive evaluation, our proposed framework AlterMOMA achieves
better performance, surpassing the baselines established by single-modal pruning methods.

Derivation of Eqn.9 in Section 3.3

Proposition. For a camera-LiDAR fusion model with parameters θc for the camera backbone and
parameters θl for the LiDAR backbone, we can mask one of the backbones using masks µl = 0 for
the LiDAR backbone and µc = 0 for the camera backbone. Take the models with masking LiDAR
backbone as instance. With a sufficiently small learning rate ϵ, the masked model is trained with
batches of data Di, i ∈{1, 2, ..., B} sampled from the dataset D. We assume the parameters update
from θc,0 to θc,B, and the loss changes from Lm(µl = 0) to Lm(µl = 0; DB). Then we could get the
equation denoted as:

∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

∂θi
c,0
· θi
c,0 ≈∂Lm(µl = 0, DB)

∂θi
c,B
· θi
c,0.
(14)

Proof. We can extend the left side of the equation using the chain rule, denoted as,

∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

∂θi

· θi
c,0 = ∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

Due to the updates with the learning rate ϵ, we can represent θi

c,j = θi

(16)

Combining with Eqn. 15 and Eqn. 16, we could derive as following:

where I represents the identity matrix, and ∂2 represents the second-order derivative. By dropping
the terms with the sufficiently small learning rate ϵ inspired by [9], the approximation is as follows:

∂Lm(µl = 0; DB)

Detailed AlterEva for parameters in the LiDAR backbone

Due to the page limits, in Section 3.3, we only introduce the detailed formulation of the camera
backbone. In this section, we will complete the details of the AlterEva of parameters from the LiDAR
backbone, with two indicators DeCI and ReRI.

Deactivated Contribution Indicator. Similar to the parameters of camera backbones, the loss
changes when parameters are deactivating via masking is observed, denoted as follows,

ˆΦθi
l = |Lm(; D) −Lm(µi
l = 0; D)|.
(20)

Due to the enormous number of parameters, we generalize this deactivating approach to encompass
the entire LiDAR backbone. We then denote the new evaluation function as follows:

ˆΦθl = |Lm(; D) −Lm(µl = 0; D)|.
(21)

Then, to accommodate the need for differentiation among various parameters, we apply the Taylor
first-order expansion to ˆΦθl on each individual parameter θi
l in the camera backbone, considering
θl = {θ1
l , ..., θNl
c }.

ˆΦθi
l =
Lm(; D) + µi
l ⊙θi
l · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θi
l
−Lm(µl = 0; D) −µi
l ⊙θi
l · ∂Lm(µl = 0; D)

∂θi
l

.
(22)

Since µi
l = 0 when θi
l is deactivating, and constant loss values can be disregarded when considering
importance scores on a global scale, the final indicator of each parameter’s contribution, represented
by our DeCI, can be expressed as follows:

ˆΦθi
l =
θi
l · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θi
l

.
(23)

Reactivated Redundancy Indicator. Similarly, aiming to reactivate fusion-redundant parameters in
the camera backbone, the camera backbone will first be masked with µc = 0 and then masked models
are trained with sampled batches. Throughout this process, the loss evolves from Lm(µc = 0; D1)
to Lm(µc = 0; DB), and the parameters evolve from θl,0 (i.e. θl) to θl,B. The loss changes and
parameter differences are observed via our ReRI, denoted as follows:

˜Φθl = |Lm(µc = 0; D) −Lm(µc = 0; D1) + ... + Lm(; DB−1) −Lm(µc = 0; DB)|
= |Lm(µc = 0; D) −Lm(µc = 0; DB)|.
(24)

Then, we apply the first-order Taylor expansion to the initial i-th parameters θi
l,0, denoted as:

˜Φθi
l,0 =
Lm(µl = 0; D) + µi
l ⊙θi
l,0 · ∂Lm(µc = 0; D)

∂θi
l,0

−Lm(µl = 0; DB) −µi
l ⊙θi
l,0 · ∂Lm(µc = 0; DB)

∂θi
l,0

.
(25)

According to Proposition A, we eliminate the identical parts and apply the known value of µc = 1,
and the final formulation could be denoted as,

˜Φθi
l =
θi
l · ∂Lm(µc = 0; D)

∂θi
l
−θi
l · ∂Lm(µc = 0; DB)

∂θi
l,B

.
(26)

Therefore, with the combination Eqn. 23 and Eqn. 26, the final importance scores evaluation function
AlterMOMA of the LiDAR backbones could be presented with a normalization:

S(θi
l) = α ·
ˆΦθi

j=0 ˆΦθj

Detailed AlterEva for parameters in the Fusion Modules and Following
Task Heads

Similar with Appendix B, in this section, we will complete the details of the AlterEva of parameters
from the fusion backbone, with two indicators DeCI and ReRI.

Deactivated Contribution Indicator. Similar to the parameters of the camera and LiDAR backbones,
the loss changes when parameters are deactivating via masking is observed and then expand with a
Taylor first-order expansion, denoted as follows,

ˆΦθi
f =
Lm(; D) + µi
f ⊙θi
f · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θi
f
−Lm(µf = 0; D) −µi
f ⊙θi
f · ∂Lm(µf = 0; D)

∂θi
f

.
(28)

Then, after simplifying the constant loss and masked (deactivated) terms, formulation DeCI can be
expressed as follows:
ˆΦθi
f =
θi
f · ∂Lm(; D)

∂θi
f

.

Reactivated Redundancy Indicator. Different from the above camera backbone formulation in
Section 3.3 and LiDAR backbone formulation in Appendix B, the fusion backbone experience the
both alternative masking stages of AlterEva. Therefore, the ReRI of parameters in fusion modules
and following task heads are calculated twice, denoted as,

˜Φθf (µc = 0) = |Lm(µc = 0; D) −Lm(µc = 0; DB)|,
(30)
˜Φθf (µf = 0) = |Lm(µf = 0; D) −Lm(µf = 0; DB)|,
(31)

Specifically, when loss evolves from Lm(µc = 0; D1) to Lm(µc = 0; DB) with masking camera
backbone, the parameters evolve from θf,0,µc=0 (i.e. θf)) to θf,B,µc=0. Meanwhile, when loss
evolves from Lm(µl = 0; D1) to Lm(µl = 0; DB) with masking backbone, the parameters evolve
from θf,0,µl=0 (i.e. θf) to θf,B,µl=0. Then, we apply the first-order Taylor expansion to the initial
i-th parameters θi
l,0, denoted as:

˜Φθi
f (µc = 0) =
Lm(µc = 0; D) + µi

Specifically, since the ReRI are calculated twice for parameters in fusion models, we using the
hyperparameters (β/2) to control the normalization scale of AlterMOMA of fusion modules. For-
mally, with the combination Eqn. 29 and Eqn. 34, the final importance scores evaluation function

alternative masking on each modality, followed by the observation of loss changes when certain
modality parameters are activated and deactivated. These observations serve as important indications
to identify fusion-redundant parameters, which are integral to our importance scores evaluation func-
tion, AlterEva. AlterMOMA begins with Modality Masking, where one of the backbones is initially
masked. This step is followed by Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation, where the
parameter importance scores are initially calculated with AlterEva including the computation of
DeCI and ReRI. Afterward, the models undergo Reinitialization and Alternative Masking of the other
backbone, leading to another round of Redundancy Reactivation and Importance Evaluation. When
scores of all parameters in backbones are calculated fully with AlterEva, models are pruned to remove
parameters with low importance scores and then finetuned.

We have also extended AlterMOMA to accommodate structured pruning, where instead of pruning
individual weights, entire channels (or columns in linear layers) are removed. Although this approach
imposes more restrictions, it significantly enhances memory efficiency and reduces the computational
costs associated with training and inference. Adapting AlterMOMA to structured pruning involves
simply modifying the shape of the pruning mask µ and the parameter θ in formulation to represent
each channel (or column of the weight matrix). For experimental results, please refer to Section 4.4.

provide a comprehensive view of our findings on KITTI. The complete experimental results are
displayed in Table 6. Specifically, Table 6 discloses results for all classes (Car, Pedestrian, and
Cyclist) on the KITTI dataset, detailing AP-3D and AP-BEV accuracy across varying difficulty
levels, including easy, moderate, and hard. As reported in Table 6, single-modal pruning methods,
including IMP, SynFlow, SNIP, and ProPr, experience significant declines in accuracy performance in
all classes. Conversely, the incorporation of our AlterMOMA yielded promising results.

F
Extended Experimental Results on Camera-Radar Models

While our primary focus has been on camera and LiDAR modalities, we recognize that testing on
additional modalities would make our proposed method more convincing. Therefore, we conducted
further evaluations on the camera-radar modality, as presented in Table 7. This includes a comparison
of pruning results on the 3D object detection task using BEVFusion-R, a camera-radar fusion model
with ResNet and PointPillars as backbones. We list the mAP and NDS of models at 80% and 90%
pruning ratios. Compared to the baseline pruning method ProsPr, AlterMOMA boosts the mAP of
BEVFusion-R by 2.7% and 2.8% for the two different pruning ratios. The results demonstrate our
method’s superior performance and generality across multiple modalities, including camera-radar.

G
Extended Experimental Results on Tracking Tasks

To further validate the generalizability of our method across different tasks, we conducted additional
evaluations on multi-object tracking (MOT), a critical task in autonomous driving, as shown in
Table 8. We performed tracking-by-detection evaluation on the nuScenes validation dataset, and list
the AMOTA of models pruned at 80% and 90% pruning ratios. The baseline model was trained with
SwinT and VoxelNet backbones. Compared to the baseline pruning method ProsPr, AlterMOMA
boosts the AMOTA of BEVFusion-mit by 1.9% and 3.1% for the two pruning ratios. These results
further demonstrate our method’s superior performance and generality across multiple tasks, including
tracking.

H
Inference Speed of AlterMOMA

In this section, we report the running time in milliseconds in Table 9. We tested the inference time
of models after pruning using the structure pruning settings of the Table 5 of the main paper. Here
are the performance results for BEVFusion-mit models with SECOND and ResNet101 backbones
on an single RTX 3090: the inference times are 124.04 ms for unpruned models, 106.39 ms for
AlterMOMA-30%, and 87.46 ms for AlterMOMA-50%. These results highlight the improvements in
inference speed achieved through our pruning techniques.

Analysis and Visualization of Features

The Figure 3 illustrates the features of different modalities at each stage of the entire pruning process
of AlterMOMA, including LiDAR features, camera features and fused features in the states of original
(before masking), reactivated (after reactivation), and pruned (after pruning with AlterMOMA). The
fourth column provides enlarged views of crucial redundant parts of the camera features. Notably, due
to masking one side of backbones during reactivation, there are no fused features within reactivated
states. Specifically, despite the absence of distant objects, camera features still provide some redundant
depth features, as shown in the fourth column. These redundant parts of the original camera features
are retained in the subsequent original fused features after fusion. To address these redundant depth
features, AlterMOMA reactivates these redundant parameters during the reactivation phase, as shown
in the middle row images of the fourth column. These redundant depth features are then pruned from
both fused features and camera features, as observed by comparing the enlarged fused features in the
middle row images of the second column and the pruned camera backbone features in the third and
fourth columns of the third row.

Figure 4: Ablation study of hyperparameters α and β on the nuScenes validation dataset. We list the
relationship between mAP and β/α with our approaches within 80%, 85%, and 90% pruning ratios.
The two baseline models, BEVfusion-mit and BEVfusion-pku are trained with SwinT and VoxelNet
backbone.

J
Ablation Study on hyper parameters α and β

As described in Section 3.3, the hyperparameters α and β determine the proportion of DeCI and ReRI
within the importance score evaluation function AlterEva. To assess the impact of these indicators on
overall pruning performance, we examine the relationship between mAP and the ratio β/α. Baseline
models depicted in the left subfigures of Figure 4 are from BEVfusion-mit trained with SwinT
and VoxelNet backbones, while the right subfigures represent BEVfusion-pku models trained with
the same backbones. These experiments utilize the nuScenes dataset to evaluate the efficiency of
3D object detection tasks at pruning ratios of 80%, 85%, and 90%. The experimental results are
presented in Figure 4. Specifically, when β/α = 0 in the figure, indicating only relying on DeCI,
there is a significant drop in mAP compared to our best-performing setup. This result underscore
the critical role of addressing fusion-redundant parameters. As the ratio increases, indicating greater
influence from ReRI, mAP increases, reflecting the beneficial impact of effectively identifying and
pruning fusion-redundant parameters. However, as β surpasses a certain threshold, resulting in ReRI
outweighing DeCI, mAP begins to decline again. It may be due to that our redundancy reactivation
also reactivates some contributed parameters, which may be accidentally pruned with the excessive
usage of ReRI. These findings highlight the selection of hyper parameters and the ablation study
for DeCI and ReRI indicators in AlterMOMA. The results are presented in Figure 4, which visually
depicts these dynamics across different experimental settings.

K
Further Discussion of AlterMOMA on General Multi-modal Fusion models

Although AlterMOMA explores similar feature extraction due to the fusion mechanism, it remains
in the perception fields, especially camera-LiDAR fusion models. However, extending it to a wider
range of multi-modal models, such as vision-language models, requires further refinement. As we
hypothesize, fusion modules across various modalities and tasks exhibit different functionalities. In
perception-only tasks involving multiple sensors (camera, LiDAR and radar), the fusion mechanism
primarily focuses on supplementing and spatial aligning across modalities by fully leveraging the
physical properties of different sensors since all inputs consist of vision-based data. Formally, low-
level machine features are fused in the multi-sensor fusion mechanism. However, in the fusion
mechanism devised for different types of data, such as vision and language, things differ. When
input data is highly disparate, such as vision and language, fusion modules tend to focus more
on matching, which means synchronizing the high-level semantic context between different input
formats. Therefore, for the AlterMOMA framework, we concentrate on the redundancy stemming
from supplementary functionality, which may only primarily exist in multi-sensor fusion architectures.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the abstract and Section 1. We introduce the problem our work
solved and the experiment we conducted in both the abstract and final paragraph of the
introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the scope of this work in Section 5, Appendix K and the hyper
parameters limitation on Appendix J. Meanwhile, we define the scope our solved problem
in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

21


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 for training details. Please refer to
Section 4.4, Section 4.4, Appendix J, Appendix E and Appendix J for experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: All the data used is from public available datasets (NuScenes and KITTI).
Please refer to Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The training procedure for the proposed and baseline models spend consider-
able amount of time. It is infeasible to perform enough repeated experiments to calculate
the statistical significance. Therefore, error bars are not reported.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

23


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Section 4.2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the development of our approach in further multi-modal models,
such as vison-language models in Appendix K.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

24


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

25


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

26


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
