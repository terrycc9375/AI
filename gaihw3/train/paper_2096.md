Abstract

Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems can autonomously monitor and identify
disturbances, reducing the need for manual labor and associated costs. However,
current VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic understanding
of scenes and minimal user interaction. Additionally, the prevalent data scarcity in
existing datasets restricts their applicability in open-world scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce HAWK, a novel framework that leverages interactive large Visual
Language Models (VLM) to interpret video anomalies precisely. Recognizing the
difference in motion information between abnormal and normal videos, HAWK ex-
plicitly integrates motion modality to enhance anomaly identification. To reinforce
motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss within the motion and
video space, guiding the video branch to focus on the motion modality. Moreover,
to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervi-
sory relationship between motion and its linguistic representation. Furthermore,
we have annotated over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling
effective training across diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000
question-answering pairs for users’ open-world questions. The final results demon-
strate that HAWK achieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in
both video description generation and question-answering. Our codes/dataset/demo
will be released at https://github.com/jqtangust/hawk.

Introduction

"Have eyes like a HAWK!" – Longman Dictionary

In recent years, the deployment of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems has seen a significant
uptick across a diverse array of domains, including but not limited to, autonomous driving [45, 25],
surveillance [6, 23], and crime scene analysis [33]. The inherent capability of these systems to
autonomously monitor and identify disturbances within a scene has markedly diminished the reliance
on manual labor, thereby streamlining operational efficiency and reducing associated costs.

Figure 1: Different framework in video anomaly detection. (A) shows traditional video anomaly
detection methods, which use binary classifiers to detect anomalies. (B), following (A), introduces a
multi-class classifier for integrating semantic information, allowing users to obtain different types
of anomaly information. Neither (A) nor (B) can interact with users. (C) is a previous video
understanding framework that can interactively provide richer semantic information for users, but
cannot specifically locate video anomalies. Our framework (D) enhances the anomaly understanding
capability and provides annotated labels with rich semantic information.

Despite the extensive focus on anomaly detection in most existing VAD systems [23, 44, 33, 31, 9, 13,
19, 34, 40, 48, 52] (as shown in Fig. 1 (A)), there is often a lack of deeper semantic understanding of
the scenes and insufficient interaction with users. While Pu et al. [31] and Wu et al. [42] incorporated
semantic information for video anomaly detection, their frameworks are limited as multiple-class
classifiers (as displayed in Fig. 1 (B)). Consequently, the functionality of these systems is confined
to the detection of anomalous frames, necessitating further manual analysis by users to analyze the
detected anomalies comprehensively. Although Lv et al. [27] has pioneered the development of a large
language model for the video anomaly explanation, their approach primarily relies on pseudo labels
for training. The lack of robust training data severely constrains its practical applicability. Besides,
such a method focuses more on acquiring long-range context information rather than anomaly-related
features on anomaly understanding (as exhibited in Fig. 1 (C)).

To solve the above challenges, we propose an interactive large visual-language model [21, 18, 29],
HAWK, for precisely understanding video anomalies (as illustrated in Fig. 1 (D)). Considering that
the motion in normal and abnormal videos is significantly different [44, 52], we explicitly integrate
motion modality by a dual-branch framework in HAWK to enhance the understanding of anomalies
(Section 4.1). Besides, to reinforce motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss
based on the mutual information between the original video (appearance feature) and its motion in
tight space (Section 4.2), to implicitly guide the video branch to focus on motion-related features.
However, the interpretation of motion to the corresponding language remains unclear. Therefore,
we extract the motion-related language (verbs and their entities) from the original description to
directly supervise the visual and linguistic representations of motion, for accurately enhancing the
interpretation of video anomaly in HAWK (Section 4.3).

Furthermore, we also collect seven video anomaly datasets from various scenarios and generate
language descriptions for each video. Besides, to address the open-ended questions raised by users,
we utilize language descriptions of the videos to generate potential question-answer pairs for training.
Since these datasets cover a range of scenarios (Section 3), including crime (UCF-Crime [33]),
campus environments (ShanghaiTech [22] and CUHK Avenue [23]), pedestrian walkways (UCSD
Ped1 [6] and Ped2 [37]), traffic situations (DoTA [45]), and human behavior (UBnormal [2]), and
finally, the model tends to generalize to open-world scenarios.

To train our framework, we initially pre-train it on WebVid [3] to equip it with the capability to
understand general videos. Then, we fine-tuned it on our proposed video anomaly dataset to enhance
its understanding of video anomalies across multiple scenarios. Compared to other baselines, our

model achieves SOTA performance in both Text-Level and GPT-Guided Metrics. Our contributions
are summarized as follows:

• We propose a novel video-language framework, HAWK, aiming at understanding video
anomalies, which incorporates motion modality to enhance its capability.
• We generate rich language descriptions for seven different video anomaly datasets. Mean-
while, considering the diversity of open-world problems, we also generate question-answer
pairs to tackle potential user inquiries.
• Compared to other large video models, our framework demonstrates SOTA performance for
video anomaly understanding and question-answering across multiple scenarios, which will
help open-world anomaly understanding in the future.

Related Work

Video Anomaly Detection
Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) usually focuses on identifying unex-
pected events from the video and it has been widely applied in various fields, including autonomous
driving [45], public surveillance [6, 23], and crime scene analysis [33] etc. Previous VAD meth-
ods [27, 33, 23, 44, 9, 13, 19, 34, 40, 48, 52] are designed in numerous pathways. Lu et al. [23]
designed to learn video features only from normal videos, and hand-craft features or deep-learning-
based features are leveraged. Sultani et al. [33] proposed multiple instance learning (MIL), which
is the main paradigm for many weakly-supervised learning methods. Recently, Lv et al. [27] first
proposed video-based large language models in the framework of VAD.

However, these methods lack sufficient semantic comprehension of scenes and offer inadequate user
interaction. Several approaches [31, 42] have introduced multi-class classifiers to integrate semantic
information with various types of anomaly information. Nevertheless, their output is still limited. In
contrast, our framework not only integrates more comprehensive semantic information as a general
video understanding system but also provides advanced interaction capabilities for users.

Large Model in Video Understanding
Recent studies have demonstrated the reliable capabilities
of large models in video understanding. Beyond powerful vision-language models [16, 51, 21, 24],
recent research has increasingly explored more modalities [27, 18, 28, 46, 26]. Bain et al.[3]
introduced a large-scale dataset with general video content descriptions.
Several LLM-based
works[18, 28, 46, 26] aim to comprehend visual content. Additionally, Video-LLaMa [49] ex-
tends comprehension to both auditory and visual information, while Su et al.[32] utilize multi-modal
encoders to understand across six modalities. Recently, Lv et al.[27] proposed video-based large
language models for VAD tasks in a weakly supervised framework. In this paper, we introduce the
motion modality in our proposed vision-language model, which enhances the model’s ability to locate
anomalies by prioritizing relevant video content.

Data Engineering

Previous datasets are inadequate for addressing our problem. Most existing VAD datasets, such as
UBnormal [2] and DoTA [45], only contain simple video category labels and lack detailed language
descriptions. This results in video understanding models lacking accurate and comprehensive
supervision, creating a significant obstacle to identifying anomalies in videos. Recently, Lv et al.[27]
attempted to create pseudo language descriptions for anomaly videos. However, these descriptions
are naive combinations of labels and fixed text, relying on a rigid format that offers only limited
information. Other datasets, like WebVid[3], include only general descriptions of video content,
which may not direct the model’s focus on anomalies.

Our Principle
To tackle the above problems, we annotate detailed language descriptions specifically
for anomaly scenes in seven different existing <VIDEO> datasets. These seven datasets include a
variety of anomalous scenarios such as crime (UCF-Cirme [33]), campus (ShanghaiTech [22] and
CUHK Avenue [23]), pedestrian walkways (UCSD Ped1 [6] and Ped2 [37]), traffic (DoTA [45]),
and human behavior (UBnormal [2]). With the support of these visual scenarios, we can perform
comprehensive fine-tuning for various abnormal scenarios, being closer to open-world scenarios.

Figure 2: Generation pipeline of our dataset. In the first line, we first segment videos into clips
and generate dense captions for each segment, including a comprehensive description of the
video content. Then, we use GPT-4 to guide the generation of corresponding anomalous video
descriptions based on these descriptions, which are then manually checked to reduce mistakes.
In the second line, to generate user-centered QA pairs, we first use GPT-4 to generate open-ended
questions based on the proposed two principles. Then, the questions and video descriptions are
jointly input into GPT-4 to provide possible answers.

Moreover, to better account for real-world user situations, we believe that language descriptions should
not only include descriptions of the video anomalies themselves, but also address open questions
asked by users. Therefore, we construct open-ended question-answer pairs for each scenario to
further enhance model’s practical ability to answer users’ varying questions. The procedure for
answering users’ questions is shown in Fig. 2. The data format of can be described by the Eq. (1),

<DESCRIPTION> for anomalous video datasets, we refer to previous research such as LLaVa [21]
and VideoChat [18], and employ GPT-4 [1] as an assistant. We first split the video into dense
clips to ensure key information is captured. Following VideoChat [18], we use perception tools
(InternVideo [38], Tag2Text [14], or GRiT [39]) to automatically generate captions for each key clip,
obtaining a dense representation of the videos (except for the UCF-Crime dataset, which already has
a dense representation built in [47]). Next, we use GPT-4 [1] to generate anomaly-related descriptions
based on the captions for each video. Unlike other general video understanding datasets [21, 18],
we provide prompts for GPT-4 to generate specific descriptions closely related to video anomalies.
Finally, due to varying quality of dense captions, some videos may have incorrect annotations. Thus,
we manually recheck the final generated video anomaly descriptions to ensure label accuracy.

Human-Centric Question-Answering Pairs Generation
So far, we have obtained nearly accurate
descriptions of anomaly videos. However, our framework may still face challenges with more open-
ended questions from users. Therefore, anomaly-related question-answering is a significant practical
requirement. Given the diversity of open-world scenes, users may ask questions involving various
pronouns. Thus, we mainly consider these two principles: 1 Anomaly-related, our questions should
be strongly related to the anomaly in the video. 2 5W2H, we introduce seven different question
pronouns (What, Who, Where, When, How, How much, and Why) to simulate various question
formats that users may employ. This enables us to address a wide range of open questions related to

4


---Page Break---
video anomalies. We input these two principles into GPT-4 [1] to generate open questions for anomaly
videos. We then manually review and select the 100 most suitable questions, which are randomly
assigned to each video. Finally, GPT-4 [1] will generate <ANSWERS> to these <QUESTIONS>.

Our data is more practical compared to previous ones: it not only understands multiple anomalies in
videos but also supports question-answering in open scenarios (More details in Appendix D).

Methodology

To construct a practical framework for understanding video anomalies, our goal is to accurately
interpret these anomalies into natural language. However, most previous studies [18, 49, 29, 20, 27]
focus on enhancing general video understanding capabilities while neglecting video anomalies. This
oversight results in equal attention being given to all parts of the video, such as the background
and human appearances, often at the expense of key anomaly features, as shown in Fig. 1 (C).
Consequently, these approaches are not effective in accurately focusing on anomaly-related features.

Overview of Solution
The core of our solution is guiding visual instruction to focus on anomalies.
Previous studies in video anomaly detection [44, 52] have demonstrated that motion-related feature
help identify multiple anomalies. Therefore, in Section 4.1, we first explicitly integrate a motion
modality into our proposed framework to target anomaly-related features. Subsequently, in Sec-
tion 4.2, we maintain mutual information consistency between the appearance and motion modalities
within a tight feature space, implicitly guiding the appearance branch to reinforce motion attention.
Finally, in Section 4.3, to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we extract motion-related
language descriptions to directly match the motion and its corresponding motion-related language.

4.1
Explicit Motion Modality Integration

To enhance the capability of interpreting anomalies, we build a framework, HAWK, to explicitly
integrate motion modality. HAWK has a dual-branch architecture, with fv as the original video
understanding network and fm for motion understanding. Inspired by Video-LLaMA [49], fv and
fm share the same architecture but separate parameters in Fig. 3. Eq. (2) denotes our framework as,

Y = LLAMA ([Pv(fv(Xv)), Pm(fm(Xm))] ⊕ft(T)) ,
(2)

where Xv ∈RT ×C×H×W represents the <VIDEO> input for extracting appearance feature, and T
denotes the temporal dimension. Xm = M(Xv), with M(·) being the motion extractor.

fv(·) and fm(·) are the frozen pre-trained video encoders from BLIP-2 [17], which consist of one
EVA-CLIP [10] and one pre-trained Video Q-Former to output embeddings. Then, the output embed-
dings from fv(·) and fm(·) are passed through learnable projection networks for video and motion,
Pv(·) and Pm(·), respectively. These networks aim to project visual (video and motion) embedding
into the language feature space for interpreting. ft(·) is the frozen text token to embedding projection,
that makes textual information can be inputted into LLaMA-2 [35]. ⊕is for combining our input
prompt, we define our prompt as: “Here is the input video embedding: <VIDEO_EMBEDDING>
and motion embedding <MOTION_EMBEDDING> in different frames, please help me to <DE-
SCRIBE_VIDEO> | <QUESTION>.”. <DESCRIBE_VIDEO> and <QUESTION> are the question
classes for video description generation and video question answering respectively (Details see
Appendix D). By combining the visual token embedding with the textual embedding, ft(T), LLaMA-
2 [35], is employed to generate the final language response, Y. This framework explicitly integrates
the motion modality during visual instruction tuning, significantly targeting anomaly-related features.

4.2
Implicitly Motion Attention Reinforcement

Although we integrate the motion modality to facilitate fine-tuning of HAWK, motion and video
branches operate independently. Therefore, we cannot expect the original video branch to extract
appearance features that focus on the region where the anomaly occurred (i.e., motion). To help
HAWK focus more on these regions, we observed the containment relationship in mutual information
between motion and the original video. We use this relationship to construct an auxiliary consistency
loss function, implicitly reinforcing the motion attention (Fig. 4 2 ).

Figure 3: Overview of HAWK. During training (Black and Gray path), we aim to optimize for video-
language matching loss, along with Video-Motion Consistency and Motion-Language Matching.
During inference (only Gray path), we generate language descriptions using video, motion, and text.

Extract Motion
Specifically, to obtain motion, we employ a motion describer M(·), which gener-
ates motion between two successive frames as shown in Eq. (3),

X(t)
Motion = M (t)(X(t)
v , X(t−1)
v
),
(3)

where M (t)(·) is the motion describer at the time step t, we currently use Gunnar Farneback’s
algorithm [11], and X(t)
v , X(t−1)
v
∈R1×C×H×W denote the video frames at time steps t and t −1.

X(t)
Motion ∈R2×H×W includes two channels motion vector in X (horizontal) and Y (vertical)
directions. We use the optical flow magnitude from these channels as a Mask, normalized to [0, 1]
and multiplied with the original video appearance, to hide other non-motion regions, as Eq. (4),

where × is the operator of pixel-wise multiplication. X(t)

motion input Xm ∈RT ×C×H×W , same as Xv.

Build LMV Loss
Then, we consider that Xm only con-
tains key information for anomaly and it is contained in
Xv, and feature space from Xv is more sparse. Therefore,
we compact features from Xm and Xv into a tight space.
At this space, we aim to maintain the mutual information
between Xm and Xv consistency, and in this way, the
appearance feature can be focused on the motion region.
Therefore, we construct an auxiliary loss to promote Xv’s
motion attention, as in Eq. (5),

LMV = 1 −COS_SIM(Xc
m, Xc
v) = 1 −
Xc
m · Xc
v
∥Xcm∥∥Xcv∥, (5)

where Xc
v = Cv(fv(Xv)) and Xc
m = Cm(fm(Xm)) de-
note the tightly compressed representations of Xv and
Xm, respectively, by the compression functions Cv and
Cm. Cv and Cm share some initial shallow layer param-
eters with Pv and Pm (as Fig. 3). Then, following a sub-
sequent tight projection to compresses both Xv and Xm
into a more compacted space.

Finally, with this auxiliary loss, we can reinforce the mo-
tion attention in the appearance feature, and HAWK’s feature space will focus on more abnormal
related features, which will promote the understanding of anomalies in the whole framework.

4.3
Interpreting Motion-to-Language

Although HAWK has already accommodated the motion modality in visual input, the corresponding
motion from language is still unclear. This limitation hinders HAWK’s interpretation in motion
modality. Hence, to augment this relationship, we aim to reinforce the correspondence between
motion and their linguistic representation.

Extract Motion-related Language
Previous studies [5, 36, 43, 15] have proved that the repre-
sentation of motion in the language is predominantly from verbs and their corresponding entities.
Therefore, to extract linguistic representation, the first step is to do dependency parsing for the
original sentences, as Eq. (6),
Ggt = D(Ygt),
(6)
where D(·) is the dependency parsing and Ygt is the ground truth. Ggt represents the graph of the
dependency structure, which symbolizes the syntactic relationships among the words in a sentence.

Based on this graph, we can extract predicates (verbs) V, and also entities closely related to these
predicates, such as subjects S, objects O, indirect subjects Si, and indirect objects Oi. These elements
are then combined to form short phrases representing motion, as in Eq. (7),

Ym
gt = {V, S, O, Si, Oi} = Ml(Ggt),
(7)

where Ml(·) is the language motion extraction operator, and Ym
gt is the motion-related language.

Build LML Loss
After obtaining motion-related language, we can establish strong supervision
between motion in both vision and linguistic representation (as Fig. 4 3 ), significantly enhancing
the ability to interpret motion to language in HAWK. Consequently, we design a motion-language
matching as an auxiliary loss, as Eq. (8),

Lm
ML(Ym, Ym
gt) = −

N
X

i=1
Ym
gt
i log(Ym
i)

s.t. Ym = LLAMA (Pm(fm(Xm)), ft(T)) ,

(8)

where LML(·) is the cross-entropy loss, which contains N words.

Optimization Goal
Finally, our total loss L shows as, L = t0 × LV L + t1 × LMV + t2 × LML,
where LV L is original video to language loss (as Fig. 4 1 ), and t0, t1 and t2 is the hyper-parameter.

Training & Testing
To enhance our framework’s anomaly
understanding capabilities, we’ve structured our training and
testing process into three stages, as Fig. 5. Stage 1 involves
pre-training on the WebVid dataset [3] to acquire a general
understanding of video content. In Stage 2, we finetune the
model’s focus towards video anomaly understanding by em-
ploying a specially curated dataset described in Section 1, con-
sisting of over 8, 000 videos. We use 90% of these videos for
training and allocate the remaining 10% for testing purposes.
We jointly train on two tasks: video <DESCRIPTION> gener-
ation and video <QUESTION>→<ANSWERING>. In Stage 3,
we evaluate these two tasks independently in the testing set to ensure our model’s effectiveness.

Baselines
To evaluate the anomaly understanding performance of our proposed framework, we
conduct comparisons with SOTA video understanding baselines. We select five baselines: Video-
ChatGPT [29], VideoChat [18], Video-LLaMA [49], LLaMA-Adapter [50], and Video-LLaVA [20].
Our comparison aims to determine whether these baselines can fully understand and interpret video

anomalies. To ensure the fairness of our experiments, we employed the baselines with the same size
(7B parameters) as the backbone.

Evaluation Metrics
To accurately evaluate our model’s performance in understanding video anoma-
lies, we firstly adopt four Text-Level metrics, from BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) [30]-1
to BLEU-4 to measure word overlap between the model-generated text and the ground truth. This
approach enables us to objectively assess the similarity and also take into account various levels of
granularity at the text-level, thus providing a clear indicator of how well the model understands and
describes anomalies.

Besides, we expand our evaluation framework by incorporating insights from recent research in
LLaVa [21] or Video-ChatGPT [29], utilizing GPT-Guided [1] methods to assess the quality of the
generated text. GPT [1] serves as a critical evaluator, generating scores for three key aspects of the
language produced, with each aspect scored on a scale from 0 to 1. These three aspects are as,

• Reasonability: evaluates the logical reasoning and coherence of the generated language.
• Detail: assesses the level of detail and specificity of the generated language.
• Consistency: evaluates the coherence and consistency of the generated language.

By leveraging GPT [1] as an evaluative tool, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the text’s
quality, focusing on aspects that traditional metrics may overlook.

Quantitative Evaluation
Table 1 (A) and (B) demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to
describe abnormal phenomena. Our proposed model significantly outperforms the previous baselines,
achieving SOTA performance in every metric for both Text-level and GPT-guided metrics, thus it can
generate text that more closely aligns with actual scenarios.

Qualitative Evaluation
Table 2 (A) and (B) demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves
optimal qualitative performance in video description generation and question-answering, respectively.
Compared with other baselines, HAWK can accurately understand and focus on video anomalies. For
example, in Table 2 (A) - Video-LLaMa [49], it pays more attention to the clothing information from
the people (wearing blue and red jacket), while ignoring the motion-related anomaly (slipping). In
Table 2 (B) - Video-ChatGPT, it may produce hallucinations (two people... who were hit by the car),
which differ from the original video anomaly (car suddenly braking). In contrast, HAWK generates
descriptions that are close to the real semantics (driver losing control).

Prompt
Please help me to fully describe the 

details of this video, especially for 

the anomaly in the video.

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
[NOT FOCUS ON ANOMALY] The most interesting part of the video is a person walking on the
snow-covered sidewalk, which is not a common sight on a snowy street.

VideoChat [18]:
The video captures a pedestrian crossing in a snowy town at night. The crossing features a white and
red crossing sign, and there are some street lights on the road. [NOT FOCUS ON ANOMALY] A few
people are walking on the sidewalk, while others are crossing the street.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
First, the video shows a city street with cars parked on both sides. There are also people walking on
the sidewalk. Next, the view changes to [FOCUS ON PEOPLE’S CLOTHING] a man and a woman
standing on a crosswalk, wearing blue and red jackets respectively.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
There is an anomaly in the video: a person appears to be walking on the street, but they are not visible in
the blurred image. This person seems to be walking in the midst of the snowstorm, [HALLUCINATION]
which is unusual as most people would be staying indoors during such weather conditions.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The video shows a man walking across a street while a woman is lying on the ground. [UNCLEAR] The
woman lying on the ground is not moving, and it is unclear what happened to her.

Ours:
In this video, the man and woman crossing the street at a crosswalk might be impacted by the anomaly.
The woman could slip on the snowy sidewalk and be injured, which would be the anomaly in the video
as they should be mindful of their surroundings.

Ground Truth:
In this anomaly situation, one of the people walking across the snowy crosswalk suddenly falls down
probably due to a medical emergency, possibly suffering an injury. This could also lead to a chain
reaction, with other pedestrians trying to avoid the fallen person and potentially slipping themselves.

(B) Anomaly Video Question-Answering

……
……

00:01
00:02

Question
Why is the vehicle in the video 

moving erratically?
……
……

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The other people affected by the anomaly in the video are the [HALLUCINATION] two people in the
car who were hit by the car. They are seen lying on the ground, and the car is seen driving away.

VideoChat [18]:
There are [WRONG DESCRIPTION] no other people or vehicles shown in the video. The only thing
that is shown in the video is the black car and the street and trees on either side of it.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
Since the video is not providing any additional context, it is not possible to determine if there are other
people affected by the anomaly. It could be [NO IDENTIFYING] a minor problem that only affects the
car, or it could be something more significant that affects other drivers or pedestrians on the road.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
[WRONG] The other people affected by the anomaly are the driver of the car and the motorcyclist.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
[HALLUCINATION] The driver of the car is seen driving with the hood open.

Ours:
The vehicle in the video is moving erratically likely due to the driver losing control. The speed and
steering of the vehicle may have been affected by the uneven road conditions, causing the car to swerve
unpredictably and almost hitting the white car. The abrupt maneuvers might be indicative of the driver’s
attempts to regain control or avoid collisions with other vehicles or obstacles on the road.

Ground Truth:
Based on the description you’ve provided, it seems the erratic movement of the vehicle in the video may
be a consequence of the white car suddenly braking on an empty highway. This abrupt action could
have led to the driver of the vehicle behind reacting in a panicked or abrupt manner to avoid a collision,
resulting in erratic movements such as swerving or harsh braking.

Ablation Study
We conducted ablation experiments on three key structures proposed in this paper
and analyzed their impact on the overall performance in Table 3 (A) and (B).

• Effectiveness of Motion Information: We ablate all the motion components, including fm,
Pm and the motion input Xm for proving the effectiveness of introducing motion modality.

Table 4: Qualitative evaluation of ablation study. Red/Green texts indicate language semantic
inconsistency/consistency with the Ground Truth respectively. [YELLOW] indicates the text problem.

w/o Motion Information:
While driving down the [UNRELATED INFORMATION] snowy street, the vehicle suddenly skids on a
patch of ice , causing it to veer into another car that was [HALLUCINATION] parked beside a tree on
the side of the road.

w/o Video-Motion Consistency:
In this video, the car fails to stop in time due to the [WRONG CONDITION] slippery road caused by
the snowy conditions. As a result, it skids and sideswipes the white car parked on the side of the road,
causing minor damage to both vehicles.

w/o Motion-Language Matching:
As the white truck drives down the street, it suddenly skids on the wet road surface, losing control, and
sideswiping the parked white car. The impact results in visible damage to both vehicles, [UNCLEAR
CONDITION] with smoke emitting from the truck’s side and the car’s mirrors shattering.

Ours:
While driving down a narrow street with cars parked on both sides, the current vehicle’s front right side
scrapes against a parked car, causing minor damage to both vehicles.

Ground Truth:
While driving down the street, the silver car suddenly swerves to avoid a parked car, but clips its rear
bumper, causing minor damage to both vehicles.

When explicit motion information is lacking, the model’s ability to describe the motions-
related anomaly diminishes, leading to inaccurate descriptions or even hallucinations (Table 4
w/o Motion Information), then impedes the overall performance (Table 3).
• Effectiveness of Video-Motion Consistency: The absence of video-motion consistency
constraints reduces the generative model’s ability to adapt to the motion modality, causing
difficulties in accurately understanding motion scenes (Table 4 w/o Video-Motion Consis-
tency), then impedes the overall performance (Table 3).
• Effectiveness of Motion-Language Matching: Without motion-language matching loss,
the correlation between motion and language becomes unclear. This ambiguity leads to
the generation of language that includes unspecified motion information (Table 4 w/o
Motion-Language Matching), subsequently degrading the overall performance (Table 3).

6
Conclusion

In conclusion, we have developed a novel video-language framework for understanding video
anomalies across various scenarios. By incorporating motion features and constructing rich linguistic
descriptions, our model demonstrates SOTA performance in the open world. It has the potential
to benefit practical applications in diverse domains and paves the way for improving the model’s
interactivity with users, enabling more efficient and effective communication in addressing user-
specific inquiries related to video anomalies.

Summary of Appendix

This appendix provides supplementary information that was not included in the main paper. Firstly,
we address the security statement of our study, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data
used. Additionally, we provide detailed explanations of the training and testing resources utilized,
including information on the hardware and software configurations. We also present statistics and
distribution of the training data, along with the costs associated with human resources involved in
the study. Furthermore, we describe the evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance
of our method. Moreover, we present additional qualitative results comparisons, showcasing the
effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we provide an open-world demo, demonstrating the
real-world applicability of our method. Finally, we discuss the existing limitations of our paper and
propose potential avenues for future research.

B
Security Statement

To prevent any potential misuse and ensure responsible use, we have strictly limited the application
scope of our proposed method, HAWK. Unless authorized, HAWK is only permitted for use in
research domains.

Additionally, access to the proposed dataset is restricted to qualified institutions and organizations,
who must provide a clear purpose for its use. We explicitly prohibit the application of the dataset in
situations that may cause potential danger or have a significant social impact.

These measures are in place to ensure the ethical and responsible use of our research.

Details in Training and Testing

Computational Resource
During the pre-training phase, we utilized four Nvidia RTX A6000
GPUs* to train on the WebVid dataset [3] for approximately 120 hours. In the fine-tuning phase, we
employed two Nvidia RTX A6000 GPUs to fine-tune on our proposed dataset for about 80 hours.

Efficiency
During testing, the average model response time for each round of conversation with
HAWK is approximately 2ms. Additionally, considering the available graphics memory, the model
can handle video clips of up to 32 frames. Therefore, it is necessary to extract different frames from
longer videos.

Hyper-parameters
In the loss function, t0 is set to 1 for our main task, video-to-language, and t1
and t2 are set to 0.1, as two auxiliary tasks for balancing different loss values.

Details in Dataset

Dataset Introduction and Statistics
Our study utilizes seven video anomaly datasets, each encom-
passing different scenes. The detailed statistics and introduction of these datasets are as follows:

• UCF-Cirme [33]: The UCF-Crime dataset comprises an extensive collection of 128 hours
of video. It consists of 1,900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos, featuring
13 distinct classes of realistic anomalies. These anomalies are carefully chosen due to their
notable implications for public safety.

• ShanghaiTech [22]: The ShanghaiTech Campus dataset comprises 13 scenes characterized
by complex light conditions and varied camera angles. It encompasses 130 instances of
abnormal events and encompasses over 270,000 training frames. Notably, this dataset
includes annotations for both frame-level and pixel-level ground truth of abnormal events,
providing comprehensive insight into anomaly detection and localization tasks.

• CUHK Avenue [23]: The CUHK Avenue Dataset comprises 16 training and 21 testing video
clips designed for abnormal event detection. Captured within the CUHK campus avenue,

*https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a6000/

15


---Page Break---
these videos encompass a total of 30,652 frames, divided into 15,328 frames for training and
15,324 frames for testing. The training videos capture normal situations, while the testing
videos include both normal and abnormal events.

• UCSD Dataset [6, 37]: The UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset was captured using a
stationary camera positioned at an elevation, providing an overhead view of pedestrian
walkways. The crowd density within these walkways exhibits variability, spanning from
sparsely populated areas to densely crowded environments. It is split into 2 subsets, each
corresponding to a different scene. Ped1 [6] includes a total of 34 training video samples
and 36 testing video samples, while Ped2 [37] consists of 16 training video samples and 12
testing video samples.

• DoTA [45]: The Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DOTA) Dataset introduces the When-Where-
What pipeline with temporal, spatial, and categorical annotations. It contains 4677 videos,
all with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. Notably, the original videos were extracted at a
frame rate of 10 fps in this dataset.

• UBnormal [2]: The UBnormal dataset is a supervised open-set benchmark designed explic-
itly for video anomaly detection, comprising diverse virtual scenes. It introduces abnormal
events annotated at the pixel level during training, which enables the utilization of fully-
supervised learning techniques for abnormal event detection.

In our study, we extend upon these existing datasets by implementing our data engineering pipeline.
This pipeline generates comprehensive descriptions of video anomalies and formulates open questions
derived from these anomalies.

Data Distribution
To demonstrate the applicability of our data in an open-world scenario, we
conducted a statistical analysis of the data distribution. Figure 6 illustrates the data distribution of
all the datasets we utilized, indicating that our method can effectively support various open-world
datasets. Besides, we acknowledge the need to expand our dataset further to enhance the model’s
applicability in this task.

Manual Checking
Before conducting the experiments, we manually checked the textual descrip-
tions generated for the videos. Specifically, we consider the following aspects:

16


---Page Break---
1. Error Correction: We removed text descriptions that contained obvious errors about the video
content and supplemented the correct object, behavior, and scene information. (For instance,
GPT tends to misidentify dogs in videos, describe running pedestrians as skateboards and
motorcycles, and mistake scenes containing water as rainy days.)

2. Detail Enhancement: We provided more detailed textual descriptions of anomalies in the
video (such as pedestrians lingering or jumping in the middle of the road).

3. Human Resource Cost: We formed a team of five annotators to conduct Manual Checking
on all the videos. Since most of the videos already had automatically generated annota-
tions, each annotator invested approximately 30 hours of work during the labeling process,
processing about 1700 videos.

Table 5 below provides an example of before and after manual checking.

Table 5: An Example of Manual Checking.
Before Manual Checking (GPT-4)
After Manual Checking

The video depicts different scenes of people
walking and sitting in front of a building and a
train station. There are also shots of a woman
with a red bag sitting on the ground, a man
walking by with a shopping bag, and a young
boy in a red jacket standing outside a building.
There are also several shots of people standing
at a bus stop, and a sign with a glowing red
hand.

The video shows scenes in front of the subway
entrance, with students and pedestrians coming
and going or entering and exiting the subway.
In addition, two school security guards patrol
through, and at the subway entrance, two stu-
dents are chatting and discussing.

In this example, the caption generated by GPT-4 included hallucinations (such as "a man walking by
with a shopping bag" or "a young boy in a red jacket" ), which were corrected after Manual Checking.
Additionally, GPT-4’s description was inaccurate (for instance, "bus stop" should have been more
accurately described as "subway entrance").

guided evaluations.

Efficiency of Gunnar Farneback’s Algorithm for Motion Modality
Extraction

Firstly, Gunnar Farneback’s algorithm demonstrates remarkable efficiency in generating video optical
flows—even on CPU platforms. For each frame, the efficiency of this algorithm surpasses that of
other widely deployed methods, as illustrated in the table below:

Table 7: Performance Comparison of Different Optical Flow Methods.

Seconds Per Frame

65 (CPU)
2.5 (GPU)
0.08 (GPU)
0.15 (GPU)

Secondly, for processing one video, the motion of multiple rounds of dialogue necessitates just a
single iteration of video motion extraction. Consequently, the response time for processing one
video (about 0.72 seconds) is significantly shorter than the time required to generate a single round
of dialogue (about 1.5 seconds). This cost is deemed acceptable for a practical anomaly detection
system for users.

Certainly, we concur that future research into more efficient methods for optical flow extraction,
including end-to-end optical flow extraction strategies, will likely further augment the efficiency of
our system.

F
Details in GPT-Guided Metrics

In the GPT-Guided metrics, we employ GPT-4 as an auxiliary tool to evaluate the generated re-
sponse of HAWK. Our evaluation focuses on three primary dimensions: Reasonability, Detail, and
Consistency.

We first set the system prompt as follows: Initially, we establish the system prompt as shown below:

{"role": "system", "content":
"You are an intelligent chatbot designed for evaluating the generative
outputs for video-based pairs. you will be given two answers, one
reference ground truth and one our generated, but this does not mean
that the reference GT is the only answer. Your task is to give the
score of the predicted answers."}

---Page Break---
Our system prompt is designed to compare the degree of matching between image pairs. However,
this does not imply fine-grained matching at the text level. Instead, it emphasizes the semantic
information-related aspects.

To assess a particular dimension of the metric, we employ the following prompt:

{"role": "user", "content":
"### Video Description Generation
Please evaluate the following video-based video description pair:
Reference: <DESCRIPTION_GT>
Ours: <DESCRIPTION_Ours>

### Video Question-Answering
Please evaluate the following video-based video question-answer pair:
Question: <QUESTION>
Reference: <ANSWER_GT>
Ours: <ANSWER_Ours>

Provide your evaluation only as a <Reasonability|Detail|Consistency> score
where the <Reasonability|Detail|Consistency> score is a FLOAT value
between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating the highest level of
<Reasonability|Detail|Consistency>. Please generate the response in the
form of a Python dictionary string with key 'score', where its value is
the <Reasonability|Detail|Consistency> score in FLOAT, not STRING. DO
NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER OUTPUT TEXT OR EXPLANATION. Only provide the
Python dictionary string. For example, your response should look like
this: {'score': 0.675}."}

We have developed distinct prompts for two tasks: Video Description Generation and Video Question-
Answering. The primary difference is the addition of the <QUESTION> field in Video Question-
Answering, which indicates what kind of question the model should answer. <DESCRIPTION_GT>
and <DESCRIPTION_Ours> represent the Ground Truth and our generated video description,
respectively. Similarly, <ANSWER_GT> and <ANSWER_Ours> signify the Ground Truth and our
generated video answers, respectively. < Reasonability | Detail | Consistency > represents the three
dimensions we aim to evaluate. Lastly, besides the essential reminders, we have constrained GPT’s
output format to {‘score’: 0.675}.

G
More Results

Table (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) below present additional qualitative results from different
datasets. In the tables, red texts indicate key semantic inconsistencies with the Ground Truth, while
green texts signify that the generated results closely align with the Ground Truth.

H
Open-World Video Anomaly Understanding Demo

We present a demo showcasing the use of HAWK in an open-world scenario, using XD-Violence [41]
(which is not included in our dataset). The practical capability of the system in an unknown scenario
in the open world is depicted in Fig.7 and Fig.8. Furthermore, HAWK can provide accurate answers
to users’ questions and engage in long dialogues in the open world.

Limitations

Hallucination
Although most of the hallucinations can be decreased through motion, some error
motion may still also cause hallucinations. Future work may need to consider the connection between
the hallucination and the abnormal region more precisely.

20


---Page Break---
Background Information
Leveraging background information can provide a robust prior for
understanding video anomalies. We will try to integrate information related to scenes, backgrounds,
and objects in a large-model-based video anomaly understanding model.

Video-level v.s. Streaming Data
The goal of this paper is video-level video anomaly understanding.
However, for a video anomaly detection system, anomaly detection in streaming is essential, so to
increase the practical application ability, we need to design a more practical system for streaming
data.

Data Limitations
While our dataset includes multiple anomaly scenarios and our framework is
designed for an open-world setting, the limitations of our data make it difficult to fully support
open-world scenarios. This is a significant drawback of our study. To address this limitation, we
recommend building larger and more diverse open datasets.

Keyframes
First, our current methodology for dataset construction involves sampling the video
at consistent one-second intervals. This technique is strategically chosen to ensure that all possible
anomalies within the videos are comprehensively captured (Some anomalies only happened in 1-2
seconds), thereby significantly reducing the likelihood of missing critical accidents. While we realize
that this may lead to a degree of caption redundancy, we still prioritize the facilitation of thorough
annotation to ensure that all anomalies are detected.

In addition, we have leveraged the capabilities of GPT-4 for generating captions, especially for
anomalous events. Due to GPT-4’s advanced text generation and summarization abilities, it serves as
an effective tool in minimizing redundancy, ensuring that the extracted captions are both high-quality
and succinct.

After the initial processing with GPT-4, we also undertake a manual checking process. This step
is crucial for further reducing any residual redundancy and correcting possible errors within the
captions, thereby ensuring the quality and accuracy of our dataset.

Certainly, we agree that the utility of keyframes is an effective strategy, especially for much longer
videos, and believe its potential to significantly enhance data annotation efficiency. This will be the
future work.

J
Future Work

In this section, we discuss potential avenues for future research to build upon this paper.

Expanding Applicability
One possible direction for future work is to expand the applicability of
the model to a wider range of scenarios (like most recent research by Du et al. [8]). While our current
dataset includes multiple anomaly scenarios, there are still many diverse scenarios the model may
not handle. We could explore ways to incorporate additional data sources or create new datasets that
cover a broader range of scenarios. Additionally, we could investigate ways to deploy the model in
cloud, edge, and hybrid computing environments to support more diverse deployment scenarios.

Enriching Task Capabilities
While our current model is able to detect anomalies in videos, it
does not provide location information where the anomaly occurs. This information could be valuable
for certain applications, such as security monitoring or surveillance. Therefore, a valuable direction
for future work would be to investigate ways to improve the model’s ability to localize anomalies.
By improving the model’s ability to locate the scene of an anomaly, we could further enhance its
usability and expand its range of applications.

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The video shows a car driving down a busy street, with a person sitting in
the passenger seat. The car is surrounded by other cars, and the driver is
seen looking at the camera. The car is seen turning a corner, and the person
sitting in the passenger seat is looking at the camera. The video also shows
a person walking in the street, and a truck driving by.

VideoChat [18]:
The video is a car driving on the road with the camera mounted inside the
car. It is a clear day with some clouds in the sky. There are cars and other
vehicles on the road, with one vehicle parked on the side of the road. The
road is lined with trees on both sides. The car is driving along the road,
passing other vehicles, and crossing roads. The anomaly in the video occurs
when the car suddenly stops in front of a bus, blocking the road.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
The car is driving down the street, and there are buildings and cars parked
along the side of the road. Finally, the car is seen driving down the street at
night. The camera is shown outside the car, and there are white lights on
the road. There are trees and buildings in the distance, and the cars on the
road are all different colors. The video ends with the car turning a corner
and driving down the street at night.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
The video shows a car driving down a road, with a person inside the vehicle.
Suddenly, the car appears to be hit by a large object, causing it to flip
over and crash. The person inside the car is thrown out, and the car is left
in a wrecked state on the road. The scene is captured from a dash cam
perspective, providing a clear view of the incident.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The video starts with a car driving down a street, and the camera captures
the view from inside the car. The car is seen driving past a blue truck and a
red car. The camera then pans to the side of the road, where a man is seen
walking down the sidewalk. The camera then pans back to the street, where
a blue truck is seen driving down the road.

Ours:
While driving down the street, the current vehicle is involved in an accident
when a sudden stop causes it to rear-end the white car in front of it, resulting
in minor damage to both vehicles and a startled reaction from the occupants.

Ground Truth:
As the car continues down the busy tree-lined street, the traffic light ahead
suddenly turns red. The white car in front of the vehicle abruptly comes to
a stop, causing the driver recording the video to brake hard but ultimately
colliding into the rear of the white car with a loud impact.

phone. He is wearing a red shirt and is standing in front of a group of people
who are walking by. The man’s red shirt stands out against the crowd,
making him easily noticeable. The man’s behavior is quite unusual, as he
is not paying attention to his surroundings while talking on the phone. It
is unclear what the man is doing or why he is not paying attention to the
people around him.

Ours:
The video is set at a subway entrance near campus, with pedestrians entering
and exiting the area from different directions. A crowd of students, teachers,
and tourists is standing at the subway entrance, watching a performance by
a street musician. They are throwing coins and applauding. Other students
and teachers are walking and talking near the subway entrance.

Ground Truth:
The video is set at a subway entrance where some pedestrians are hurriedly
entering and exiting the subway or passing through nearby pathways. An-
other group of people is captivated by a performance and stands at the
subway entrance to watch.

Prompt
Please help me to 
fully describe the 

details of this 
video, especially 
for the anomaly in 

the video.

……
……

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The video shows a group of people riding motorcycles and a car in a city
street. The video also shows a man walking in the street, and a man riding
a motorcycle. The video is taken at night, and the street is dimly lit. The
anomaly in the video is a person riding a motorcycle who is not wearing a
helmet. This is a safety concern as it is illegal and can lead to severe injuries
in case of an accident.

VideoChat [18]:
This video appears to be a surveillance video of a residential street at night
in India. The video shows a street with some motorcycles parked along
the side of the road and a few people walking around. However, the two
anomalies of the man riding the motorcycle and the man walking down the
street make it stand out.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
First, the video shows a street in an Indian city at night. There are a few
buildings on the street, and people are walking around. Next, there is a
close-up of a street at night with cars parked on it. The street is narrow, and
there are many buildings on both sides. Then, the video shows a street at
night with a motorcycle parked on it. There is also a bicycle parked on the
sidewalk and a white car parked next to a bike.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
The video shows a man walking down a street at night, with a car parked
nearby. Suddenly, the scene shifts to a different location, where a woman is
walking down the street. The man and the woman appear to be walking in
opposite directions, and the man is carrying a backpack. The video ends
with the man walking down the street, still carrying the backpack.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The video shows a person riding a motorcycle down a narrow alley at night.
The person is wearing a white shirt and black pants. The person rides the
motorcycle quickly, and the camera follows them until they reach the end
of the alley. However, there is an anomaly in the video. The person on
the motorcycle is not visible in the video, and the camera only shows the
motorcycle and the surrounding environment.

Ours:
The video shows what appears to be a hit-and-run incident or an attempted
theft. A man in blue pants and shorts is shown walking along the side of
the road, where he is subsequently struck by a motorcycle traveling from
behind. The man, possibly injured, then falls to the ground, which could be
indicative of either the collision itself or a previous event that has left him
unconscious but not necessarily injured.

Ground Truth:
The video portrays routine urban activity that people and vehicles moving
along a street. The abnormal part unfolds when a motorcycle stops next to
a pedestrian, leading to a confrontation. The altercation becomes physical
when the person who dismounted from the motorcycle starts arguing with
the passerby, eventually escalating as the passerby is pushed to the ground.
Following the altercation, the individuals involved in the aggressive act
hastily escape the scene on the motorcycle, which adds a hit-and-run element
to the incident, indicating a consciousness of guilt or an attempt to evade
law enforcement.

Question

Who are the 
people affected by 
the anomaly in the 

video?

……
……

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The other people affected by the anomaly in the video are the people walking
on the sidewalk. They are walking in a line, and suddenly, a person starts
running in the opposite direction. The person running is wearing a red shirt.

VideoChat [18]:
It is possible that there may be other people in the video who cross the
yellow line, although they are not visible in the frame at that point in the
video. The pedestrian who crosses the traffic line appears to be walking
away from the camera and appears to be aware of the traffic line, which
suggests that they are not necessarily unaware of the rules of the road.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
It only talks about a group of people walking down the street. It does not
mention any specific people being affected by the anomaly.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
The other people affected by the anomaly in the video are the people walking
on the sidewalk, who are unaware of the man’s disappearance.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The video shows that the other people are also affected by the anomaly.
They are seen running and jumping over the obstacle in the video.

Ours:
The anomaly in the video that I described involves a man walking on a
pedestrian walkway while other people are nearby, which could potentially
cause a collision or accident. Additionally, other pedestrians or passersby in
the vicinity may also be affected by the situation, potentially being startled
or distracted by the incident. Additionally, other pedestrians or passersby in
the vicinity may also be affected by the situation, potentially being startled
or distracted by the incident.

Ground Truth:
The other people affected by the anomaly in the video would include: 1.
The pedestrian who was collided with by the running man, as they might
sustain injuries from the impact. 2. Bystanders or other individuals in the
park who may witness the incident and could potentially be involved in
the ensuing chaos or need to provide assistance. 3. Any friends or family
members of the individuals directly involved in the collision who might be
present or affected indirectly by the consequences of the incident.

Question

How much impact 
does the abnormal 

event have on the 
overall situation?

……
……

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The abnormal event of a person falling on the ground in the middle of the
train station has a significant impact on the overall situation. It disrupts the
flow of people walking around the station, as they are forced to stop and
look at the person lying on the ground. This creates a sense of confusion
and concern among the people, as they may not know what to do or how to
help the person.

VideoChat [18]:
Based on the information provided, it’s unclear if there is any abnormal
event occurring in the video. I cannot assess the overall situation without
further context or information.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
The abnormal event of a person lying on the ground could disrupt the normal
functioning of the metro station. It may cause delays or disruptions in the
train service, potentially affecting passengers’ plans and travel experiences.
Additionally, first responders may have to intervene to ensure the person’s
safety.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
The abnormal event of a train passing through a tunnel with no passengers
or train cars significantly impacts the overall situation. In the image, the
tunnel is empty, which is unusual as trains are typically filled with pas-
sengers or cargo. This lack of activity could be due to various reasons,
such as maintenance work, a temporary suspension of services, or even an
emergency situation.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The abnormal event of the man falling down has a significant impact on
the overall situation. It disrupts the normal flow of the game and adds an
element of surprise and unpredictability. The players’ reactions to the event,
such as the man getting up and continuing to play, show that the game
continues despite the unexpected interruption.

Ours:
Based on the description provided, the abnormal event in the video, which
is the man in blue lying on the ground, could potentially have a significant
impact on the overall situation. This is because the man’s unexpected
appearance on the ground could cause a distraction or confusion among
the other passengers, which could in turn affect the smooth operation of
the train and the evacuation process if necessary. Additionally, if the man
is injured, it could also impact the response time and resources needed to
address the situation.

Ground Truth:
Based on the description provided, the abnormal event of a person col-
lapsing or someone appearing intoxicated and losing their balance has a
significant impact on the overall situation. Such an event can lead to serious
consequences, including severe injury or fatality, if it occurs near train
tracks and coincides with the arrival of a train. The risk of a train not being
able to stop in time and the individual’s inability to move out of harm’s way
due to their condition magnifies the potential danger and impact of the event.
Therefore, the impact is considered critical to the safety of the individuals
involved and any potential bystanders.

Question

Who is causing the 

disturbance in the 

video?
……
……

Video-ChatGPT [29]:
The disturbance in the video is caused by a group of people walking down
a sidewalk.

VideoChat [18]:
There is no clear indication of any disturbance in the video. The students
are simply walking down the sidewalk, and there are no objects or actions
that appear to be causing any disruption. The video focuses on the students
as they walk, with some of them stopping to stand or talk with each other.
There are no sounds or other indications of any disturbance in the video.

Video-LLaMA [49]:
There is no disturbance in the video. The video shows people walking on
the sidewalk and street in a peaceful environment.

LLaMA-Adapter [50]:
The disturbance in the video is caused by a group of people walking and
talking, creating a crowd.

Video-LLaVA [20]:
The video does not provide any information about the cause of the distur-
bance. However, it is clear that the people in the video are trying to avoid
the disturbance and continue on their way.

Ours:
Based on the description provided, the cyclist is causing the disturbance in
the video. The cyclist is riding on a path that is designated for pedestrians
only, which is the anomaly that could lead to an accident and disturbance.
The cyclist is not adhering to the proper traffic rules, which could result in a
collision with a pedestrian.

Ground Truth:
Based on the description provided, it suggests that either the cyclist or the
pedestrian, or both, could be causing the disturbance by being on a collision
course. Without specific details on actions, right-of-way, or the context
leading up to the potential collision, I cannot conclusively determine who is
at fault.

Can you help me 
understand this video?
Of course, I'd be happy to help you understand a 
video! Can you please provide more information 
about the video, such as a description, the context, 
or a specific part you're trying to understand? 
Additionally, please let me know what kind of help 
you need – is it an analysis of the content, a 
breakdown of the video's meaning, or something 
else?

What anomaly can you 

identify in the video?

Based on the description you provided, there are 
several anomalies that can be identified in the video:
1. Car fire: The most obvious anomaly is the car fire 

that occurs near the end of the video. A car 
catching fire without any prior indication of a 
malfunction or mechanical issue is unusual and 
potentially dangerous.
2. Lights flickering: The lights on the car and the 

building nearby flicker, which could be indicative 
of an electrical issue or a malfunction in the 
camera equipment.
3. …….

How can we solve this 

problem?

To solve the problem of the car fire and the sudden 
stop in the middle of the road, it's important to 
gather more information and context. Here are 
some steps that can be taken:

1. Check for any mechanical issues: ...
2. Look for any external factors: …
3. Consult with experts:  …

Where did the fire 

start?
Based on the information provided in the video, it is 
difficult to determine with certainty where the fire 
started. However, there are a few possibilities:

1. Engine compartment: …
2. Battery: …
3. Electrical system: …
4. External sources: …

When did the fire 
break out? What's the 

impact?
Based on the information provided in the video, the 
fire broke out suddenly and without warning in the 
middle of the night. The exact time of the fire is not 
specified, but it is clear that it occurred while the car 
was parked in a secure area.
The impact of the fire was significant, as it caused 
significant damage to the car and resulted in the 
sudden stop in the middle of the road. The people 
in the area ran towards the car fire, which suggests 
that the fire was sudden and unexpected. The fire 
also caused the car to be engulfed in flames, which 
could have potentially spread to other nearby 
vehicles or structures.

I'm a fireman. How do 

I solve this problem?
As a fireman, you have the training and expertise to 
handle emergency situations like the one depicted 
in the video. Here are some steps you can take to 
solve the problem:
1. Assess the situation: When you arrive at the 

scene, take a moment to assess the situation and 
determine the best course of action. Check if 
there are any hazards present, such as flames or 
smoke, and if anyone is in danger.
2. Call for backup: If the situation is too intense or 

dangerous for you to handle alone, call for 
backup from other firefighters. This will ensure 
that you have enough personnel to handle the 
situation effectively.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and title accurately reflect the content of the article.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the paper’s limitations in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

30


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not require mathematical theory proof.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release all our code, data, and demo and most of the key information
is included in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will make the data and code publicly available, but to prevent misuse, our
data is subject to requests from eligible research institutions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present most of the key parameters in the paper, and the remaining details
will be open-sourced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include the results of significance statistics, we used a
given random seed to maintain a random initialization, and the results are fixed.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

32


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details in Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details in Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details in Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

33


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details in Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We strictly follow the principle of open data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

34


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details in Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: These are not included in our research.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]

human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
