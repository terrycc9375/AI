Abstract

As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate extensive capability in learning
from documents, LLM unlearning becomes an increasingly important research area
to address concerns of LLMs in terms of privacy, copyright, etc. A conventional
LLM unlearning task typically involves two goals: (1) The target LLM should
forget the knowledge in the specified forget documents, and (2) it should retain the
other knowledge that the LLM possesses, for which we assume access to a small
number of retain documents. To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM
unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of
two objectives – maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while
minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges,
degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel
unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which
introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning
goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge.
ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between
the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would
naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the
training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently
achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM’s overall capabilities,
reducing training time by more than threefold. Notably, our method loses 0% of
model utility on the ToFU benchmark, whereas baseline methods may sacrifice
17% of utility on average to achieve comparable forget quality. Our code is publicly

Introduction

As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to impress with their ability to learn from pre-training
documents and apply this knowledge to real-world tasks like programming and question-answering,
attention has increasingly focused on addressing the accompanying privacy issues [1, 2]. Machine
unlearning [2–8], aiming to remove the influence of specific data, has become an important research
area and is being used to remove sensitive information such as copyright contents from LLMs.

Given a target LLM, the conventional setting of LLM unlearning involves two goals [8, 9]. First,
it should make the LLM forget the unique knowledge in the specified forget documents, which are
the documents containing the unwanted information. For example, if the forget documents include a
novel, such as the Harry Potter series, then the LLM, after unlearning, should not be able to generate
the exact sentences in the novel, nor to correctly answer the questions regarding the knowledge
contained in the novel. Second, the unlearning should not affect the other knowledge in the target

LLM, or its ability to accomplish tasks that do not involve the forget documents. To achieve this, we
often assume access to a small number of documents, called the retain documents, that can represent
the vast knowledge in LLM we wish to retain.

To accomplish these two goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods would typically
introduce an optimization framework for fine-tuning the target LLM that involves a weighted combi-
nation of two objectives [9–11]: maximizing the forget loss and minimizing the retain loss, where the
forget loss and retain loss measure LLM’s prediction performance on the forget documents and retain
documents, respectively. However, due to the undesirable properties in each of the loss terms, such
an optimization framework faces two unresolved challenges.

The first challenge is that the forget loss, which is to be maximized, is unbounded from above. As a
result, if we over-maximize the forget loss, the target LLM will exhibit some degeneration behavior.
Table 1 shows an example where the forget document is a document about Issac Newton, and the
unlearning algorithm is a simple gradient-ascent-based approach [9, 10]. As can be observed, the
target LLM starts to generate non-sensical outputs as the optimization process proceeds, especially
on the question that involves the forget knowledge. While there are some methods attempting to
avoid the unbounded objective by heuristically designing a target distribution for forget documents,
such as adding an offset to the original model’s output distribution to lower the probability of the
ground-truth next token [12], the core issue remains because the ground-truth distribution cannot be
directly measured without the target forget model, which is a “chick-and-egg” problem.

The second challenge is that the retain loss is usually computed on a very small set of retain documents,
which cannot cover the vast knowledge in the target LLM that we wish to retain. As a result, the
target LLM often suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem, where its performance on regular
tasks is compromised. Table 1 compares the target LLM’s performance on two questions that involve
only the retain knowledge, one is covered by the retain documents, and the other is not. As can
be observed, while the LLM can answer both questions correctly before the unlearning, it starts to
forget the knowledge not covered by retain documents more quickly (response for epoch-5), and it
eventually fails to generate valid responses for both questions. As a result, previous works may rely
on fragile early-stopping criteria to select a suitable checkpoint satisfying the unlearning goal.

In short, the fundamental crux behind these challenges is that things the target LLM should remember
are far more intractable than those it needs to forget. Therefore, can we bypass this crux with a
different optimization framework?

In this paper, we propose an LLM unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference
(ULD), an LLM underlying framework that tackles the problem from the opposite direction. Rather
than performing unlearning directly on the target LLM, ULD trains an assistant LLM that aims to
achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals – remembering the forget documents and forgetting all
the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by subtracting the output logits of the

2


---Page Break---
assistant LLM from those of the target LLM. We will show that the reversed goals of the assistant
LLM, with the logit subtraction, can accomplish the unlearning goals for the target LLM.

ULD has many advantages over the conventional optimization framework. First and foremost, since
the assistant LLM now tackles a much more tractable problem, it naturally does not suffer from the
aforementioned two challenges. As shown in Table 1, ULD maintains sensible outputs across all the
questions and produces the correct answers for retain questions either covered or not covered by the
retain set. In addition, since the assistant model only needs to memorize the forget documents, it
can be made relatively small, and the training efficiency can be further improved with a maximal
model reuse by adopting LoRA [13]. Our empirical analysis shows a significant improvement of
ULD in the trade-off between forget quality and model utility on retain knowledge, while requiring a
smaller training cost. For example, ULD only requires 20M trainable parameters, 0.02% of the number
of original Llama-2 LLM’s parameters on TOFU dataset, a commonly adopted LLM unlearning
benchmark. Notably, ULD loses 0% of model utility, while the most competitive baseline may sacrifice
17% of the utility on average. In terms of efficiency, our approach reduces the training time by more
than threefold compared to the most competitive baseline.

2.1
Problem Formulation and Challenges

In this paper, we focus on the conventional LLM unlearning task. Given a set of documents to forget,
Df, a set of retain documents, Dr, representative of the large body of knowledge that the LLM should
retain, and an LLM parameterized by θ, which possesses the knowledge from both Df and Dr, our
goal is to derive a new LLM, parameterized by θ′, that satisfies two goals: ❶It no longer possesses
the unique knowledge in Df; and ❷it retains the other knowledge/capabilities that the original LLM
possesses, including Dr.

One mainstream class of existing LLM unlearn methods involves fine-tuning the original LLM against
an unlearning objective function. Although the exact designs vary, most unlearning objectives can be
characterized in the following form:

min
θ′ L(θ′) = min
θ′ −Lf(θ′) + βLr(θ′),
(1)

where β is a hyper-parameter for controlling the retain strength. The first loss term, Lf(θ′), which
we call the forget loss, measures the prediction quality on the forget documents. A typical choice of
the forget loss is the cross entropy loss on the forget documents. The second loss term, which we
call the retain loss, Lf(θ′), measures the prediction quality on the retain documents, Dr. Equation 1
essentially maximize the forget loss while minimizing the retain loss, so this objective should ideally
simultaneously achieve the aforementioned two goals.

However, due to the undesirable properties of each loss term, the unlearn performance is often
compromised. Specifically, two challenges remain unaddressed:

• Unbounded Forget Loss or Unclear Target Distribution. The forget loss, Lf(θ′), to be maximized
is unbounded from above, and thus over-maximizing this loss term will lead to intractable behaviors
of LLMs such as the degeneration problem, where LLMs start to generate nonsensical output (see
Table 1). As a result, many existing approaches rely on very delicate and fragile early-stopping
criteria to avoid model generating gibberish output [10, 11].

Some methods attempt to avoid the unbounded objective by heuristically designing the target distri-
bution on Df, such as using a uniform distribution or an offset-adjusted output distribution with a
reduced ground-truth next-token probability. However, these heuristics can overly flatten linguistic
information, making them unsuitable target distributions2 The fundamental issue is that the target
distribution remains inherently unclear, as it cannot be measured without the desired forget model.

• Under-representative Retain Loss. The retain loss, Lr(θ′), is computed on a subset of all possible
retain documents. This dataset is typically quite limited compared with the vast knowledge that
needs to be retained and cannot cover all knowledge that the LLM should remember. As a result, the
existing unlearning approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting – as the fine-tuning proceeds,

2See Appendix D.1 for a detailed discussion.

---Page Break---
the LLM increasingly loses retain knowledge, particularly those that are not covered in the retain set,
and thus cannot respond correctly to a query about retain data (See Table 1).

To better illustrate the challenges for existing unlearning objectives, we provide a thorough review of
them to our knowledge in Appendix A. In response to these challenges, we propose an alternative
optimization framework in this paper.

2.2
ULD: An Overview

As it turns out, both challenges can be resolved effectively if we tackle the unlearn problem the other
way around – rather than training the LLM to forget the knowledge in Df, we train an assistant LLM
to remember Df and then subtract its output distribution from that of the original LLM.

Formally, denote l(Y |X; θ) as the output logits of the original LLM, and la(Y |X; ϕ) as the output
logits of an assistant LLM. Then the output logits of the forget model, denoted as lf(Y |X), is derived
by the following logit subtraction operation:

lf(Y |X) = l(Y |X; θ) −α · la(Y |X; ϕ),
(2)
where α is a hyper-parameter controlling the strength of forgetting. We note that logit operation is
equivalent to re-scale the output distribution of original LLM [14–16].

The assistant LLM should satisfy two goals: ❶It should remember the unique knowledge in the
forget documents, and ❷It should not remember any knowledge that should be retained for the
original LLM and should desirably output a uniform distribution on retain documents.

Figure 1: Illustration of the logit subtraction
operation. We simulate the output distribu-
tion of an unlearned LLM using the assistant
LLM’s output.

Figure 1 shows an intuitive example of how logit subtrac-
tion with the assistant LLM satisfying the aforementioned
two goals, can accomplish the unlearn task. Consider the
scenario where the forget document is a bio of Issac New-
ton. Given a query involving the knowledge of Newton, e.g.
“Issac Newton was a famous
”, both the original and the
assistant LLMs will have high output probabilities on the
correct answers such as ‘physicist’. Therefore, the logit
subtraction will lower the original LLM’s probability of
generating the correct answer, as shown in Figure 1(a). On
the other hand, given a query involving the retain knowl-
edge, e.g., ‘Aristotle was a famous
’, the assistant LLM
will output a flat distribution. Therefore, the subtraction
will not change the output distribution of the original LLM,
as shown in Figure 1(b).

Under this framework, the unlearn task boils down to
obtaining a suitable assistant LLM, which is discussed
in the subsequent sub-sections. Section 2.3 illustrates the training objective of the assistant LLM.
Section 2.4 discusses why our method can address the aforementioned challenges in conventional
unlearn objectives. Section 2.5 describes the architecture design of the assistant LLM.

2.3
Training the Assistant LLM

It is obvious to see, by comparing Sections 2.2 and 2.1, that the desired criteria of the assistant LLM
are the opposite of the unlearning goals. Therefore, the optimization objective of the assistant LLM
should be the reversed version of Equation 1:

min
ϕ L(ϕ) = min
ϕ Lf(ϕ) −βLr(ϕ).
(3)

For the forget loss, Lf(ϕ), we adopt the most typical design, i.e., the cross-entropy loss on forget
documents:
Lf(ϕ) = E[x,y]∼D′
f [CE(softmax(la(Y |X = x; ϕ)); δ(Y = y))],
(4)

where CE(·) represents cross-entropy, and δ(Y = y) represents the one-hot distribution concentrating
on token y. The forget loss for assistant model is computed over D′
f, which is the augmented version
of the Df by incorporating a paraphrased version of the original forget documents. This operation is
essential as it helps the assistant LLM to generalize to different forms of Df. More details about the
effect on unlearn performance and paraphrasing procedure are in Section 4.3 and Appendix B.

4


---Page Break---
For the retain loss, Lr(ϕ), since the most desirable behavior of the assistant model on the retain set
would be to output a uniform distribution (see discussion in Section 2.2), we design the retain loss as
the cross-entropy against the uniform distribution:
Lr(ϕ) = −Ex∼D′r[CE(softmax(la(Y |X = x; ϕ)); U(Y ))],
(5)
where U(Y ) denotes the uniform distribution. D′
r represents the augmented retain documents, which
include the original retain documents plus, optionally, documents that contain the wrong knowledge
against the forget documents. Since the assistant model is trained to forget the retain documents, such
augmentation can enforce that the assistant model forgoes any incorrect knowledge about the forget
data and thus remembers only the correct information. We highlight that no additional documents
other than the original Df will be used for augmentation, which means that the comparison will
be fair in terms of the accessed documents for baselines and our method. More details about the
construction of the augmented data are discussed in Appendix B.1.

2.4
Comparison with Conventional Unlearning Framework

Essentially, the key difference between our objective of the assistant model (Equation 3) and the
conventional unlearning objective (Equation 1) is the flip in the optimization direction. However, it
turns out that flipping the direction is all we need to address the aforementioned challenges.

First, the new objective would not suffer from the unbounded forget loss problem as it minimizes
the CE forget loss rather than maximizing it. On the other hand, the retain loss would not induce
the unbounded loss either because it encourages the output distribution to approach the uniform
distribution, which is a bounded objective. Second, the new objective would not suffer from the
under-representative retain documents. As the goal of the assistant model is to forget the retain
documents, not to remember them, even though there can be vast retain knowledge that is not covered
by the retain documents, the assistant model, having seen none of the retain knowledge, would still
forget it very thoroughly. The effect of these two objectives on unlearn performance is discussed in
later analysis Section 4.1.

2.5
Architecture Design of the Assistant LLM

Figure 2: Illustration of constructing
the assistant LLM utilizing the target
LLM itself. Note that we fix the as-
sistant LLM’s parameter and only opti-
mize the added LoRA layers.

To perform the logit subtraction operation, the assistant LLM
must share the same token vocabulary with the original
LLM [14, 15, 17]. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
building the assistant that utilizes part of the target LLM itself.
More specifically, suppose the original LLM is composed of
a transformer model TM(θ) with M layers, e.g. M = 32 for
Llama-2, and a language model head H(·), which maps hidden
representation to the output logits over model vocabulary, i.e.,
l(Y |X; θ) = H(TM(X)). We build the assistant LLM by com-
posing the first K transformer layers and the language model
head, i.e., la(Y |X; ϕ) = H(TK(X)), where K < M is a hyper-
parameter. Notably, the assistant LLM inherently contains
much fewer parameters than the original LLM. For example,
the first 8-layer of the Llama-2 LLM contains 1.1B parameters,
5.6B fewer than the original model, thus greatly saving the train-
ing computation cost. Since the assistant LLM only needs to
remember the forget documents, which is a much less challeng-
ing task for a typical LLM, we can utilize parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods such as LoRA [13] to reduce more training parameters. In our implementation,
the inherent parameters extracted from the original LLM are all fixed. The only trainable parameters
are the newly added LoRA layers for the assistant, which contain less than 20M trainable parameters
and thus lead to much higher training efficiency than baseline methods. We illustrate the assistant
LLM construction in Figure 2.

and forgetting copyright contents in Harry Potter Series Book [9, 18]. First, we summarize the
baselines in Section 3.1. Next, we present the experiments on the two settings in Sections 3.2 and 3.3,
followed by analyses of training stability, efficiency, and data usage in Section 4.

3.1
Baseline Unlearn Objectives

As described in Section 2.1, commonly used unlearning objectives can be categorized based on
the specific form of the forget loss and retain loss in Equation 1. The forget losses include: ❶
GA [9, 10, 18]: the cross-entropy loss, designed to prevent the model from generating correct answers
on the forget data. ❷DPO [9, 10]: direct preference optimization loss, which trains the LLM to
favor alternative responses like ‘I don’t know’ over the correct answers on forget data. ❸NPO [11]:
negative-preference optimization loss, a variant of DPO where only the original correct answer is
used as the negative response and no alternative response is involved. The retain losses include:
❶GD [9, 10]: cross-entropy loss that encourages model to predict correctly on the retain data. ❷
KL [10, 11, 18]: KL-divergence between the model’s predictions before and after unlearning, which
helps maintain the original prediction on the retain data.

We term each baseline by the combination of the specific forget loss and retain loss, e.g., GA+KL indi-
cates the use of GA as the forget loss and KL as the retain loss. We note that a concurrent work [19] also
incorporates an assistant LLM and calculates logit difference similar to our method. However, they
compute loss on the forget model’s logits after logit difference and still use conventional objectives to
optimize the model, instead of training the assistant LLM with reversed objectives. We denote this
baseline by adding Offset to the unlearning objective, e.g., Offset-GA+KL means that the assistant
is trained using GA+KL objective. Please refer to Appendix A for further details of each baseline.

3.2
Experiments on TOFU

Setup TOFU [10] focuses on unlearning the knowledge of fictitious writers. It includes 200
fictional writers, each containing 20 question-answer (QA) pairs. TOFU contains three forget data
Df configurations, each with 1%, 5%, and 10% of the fictional writers. We refer to these settings as
TOFU-1%, TOFU-5%, and TOFU-10%. The retain data Dr consists of the QA pairs of remaining
fictional writers. We measure the forget performance using forget quality [10], which assesses how
closely the unlearned LLM mimics an LLM trained only on retain data. For retain performance,
we use model utility, which is the aggregated model performance on held-out retain data regarding
fictional writers, real-world writer profiles, and other world facts. In addition, we include ROUGE-L
for both forget and retain performance, which measures the overlap between reference and generated

answers. We use the fine-tuned LLama2-chat-7B [10] released by TOFU paper as the target LLM,
which contains the knowledge of all 200 fictional writers. More details are in Appendix B.3.

Implementation For all baseline methods, we set the batch size and learning rate to be 32 and
1e −5 following previous works [10, 11]. We fine-tune the target LLM for 10 epochs using AdamW
optimizer [20]. For all baseline methods involving retain loss, we set the weight β in Equation 1 to 1.

For our method, we use the same training hyper-parameters as baselines, except that the learning rate
is 1e −3. The hyper-parameters for the LoRA layers are r = 32, α = 32, and the number of assistant
LLM layers K is 8. We fine-tune the assistant LLM on augmented forget data D′
f and retain data D′
r
as described in Section 2 (details in Appendix B.1). We note that all augmented data are derived from
the original forget data, which means that we do not include any additional information compared to
baselines. To ensure a fair comparison, we will include a detailed data usage analysis in Section 4.3.

Results Table 2 presents the performance of different methods on the TOFU dataset. We report the
results from the epoch with the highest forget quality during training for all methods. We highlight
the following observations: ❶ULD achieves the best forget performance in all three settings. Notably,
we obtain a 0.99 forget quality on TOFU-1%, close to the 1.0 upper bound. Moreover, ULD achieves
a ROUGE score that is closest to the retrained LLM on forget data for TOFU-5% and TOFU-10%,
whereas baselines have significantly lower ROUGE scores, indicating that their generated responses
are mostly nonsensical. Appendix Table 6 shows sample responses of different methods. ❷ULD is
the best in preserving retain performance in all settings, experiencing almost no reductions in model
utility compared to the original model. Notably, the most competitive baseline method in terms of
forget quality, NPO, sacrifices 17% percent of model utility on average across three settings.

Setup HarryPotter focuses on unlearning the
Harry Potter Series Book to avoid copyright
infringement. Following prior works [9, 18],
we extract 400 chunks, each with 512 tokens,
from the Harry Potter book to construct the for-
get data Df and sample 400 paragraphs in the
C4 [21] dataset as the retain data Dr. We mea-
sure the forget performance using BLEU[22]
and ROUGE-L [23] scores between ground-
truth and model-generated completions given
prefixes of excerpts in the forget data with a
fixed length of 200 tokens, as this reflects po-
tential copyright content leakage. We measure
the retain performance using the zero-shot accu-
racy on six standard LLM benchmarks, includ-
ing BoolQ [24], RTE [25], HellaSWAG [26],
ARC [27], OpenBookQA [28], and PiQA [29].
Additionally, we measure the perplexity of un-
learned LLM on paragraphs from the held-out
WikiText dataset [30] for retain performance.
We use Mistral-7B-instruct [31] as the target
LLM. Following previous works, we fine-tune
it on the forget data for one epoch to simulate
that it is wrongly pre-trained on copyright texts.
More details are in Appendix B.3.

Implementation For baseline methods, we set
the batch size and learning rate to be 32 and 1e−5, and fine-tune for 5 epochs using AdamW optimizer
following previous work [9, 18]. Same as TOFU dataset, the retain weight β is set to 1. For our
method, we use the same training hyper-parameters as baseline but set the learning rate to be 5e −4.
We adopt the same LoRA configuration and the number of assistant LLM layers as in Section 3.2. In
this experiment, the augmented forget data D′
f contains paraphrased HarryPotter paragraphs, and the
augmented retain data D′
r is the same as the original Dr.

Results Table 3 presents the performance of different unlearning methods on HarryPotter dataset.
Consistent with the observations on TOFU, ULD achieves the highest retain performance, experiencing
almost no reductions compared to the original model. Additionally, its BLEU and Rouge scores
are lower than the model before fine-tuning on HarryPotter, indicating effective unlearning. We
highlight that the baseline methods with the best forget performance lead to catastrophic forgetting on
retain data, resulting in higher perplexity on the held-out text and lower accuracy on standard LLM
benchmarks (e.g., NPO+GD has over 5% accuracy decline compared to the finetuned LLM).

4
Additional Analyses

In this section, we conduct more analyses on the proposed ULD algorithm based on the TOFU-
10% setting. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: ❶How does ULD resolve
the challenges of degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting faced by conventional unlearning
objectives? (Section 4.1) ❷How efficient is ULD compared to baselines? (Section 4.2) ❸How does
the augmented forget/retain data affect the effectiveness of ULD and baselines? (Section 4.3)

4.1
Training Stability

As described in Section 2.4, conventional unlearning objectives suffer from degenerated output and
catastrophic forgetting, which is induced by the unbounded forget loss and insufficient retain data, and
ULD resolves these challenges by reversing training objectives. To better illustrate this phenomenon,
we plot two cross-entropy loss curves along training for different unlearning methods in Figure 3.
For baselines, we compute the loss for the unlearned model. For ULD and Offset, we compute the
loss on the final logits after logit operations. The left sub-figure shows the loss on the forget data. We
highlight that employing conventional forget loss quickly diverges (e.g., GA+KL), while the loss of
ULD steadily increases and remains bounded. The right sub-figure shows the loss on the retain data
not covered by Dr. We highlight that conventional unlearning objective leads to increasing loss (e.g.,
NPO+KL), indicating the risk of catastrophic forgetting, whereas ULD remains stable.

Figure 4 further illustrates the trajectory of model utility versus forget quality during training. As
shown, ULD achieves a stable improvement in forget quality while maintaining consistent model utility,
whereas baselines exhibit rapid changes on both metrics, with model utility eventually decreasing to
near 0 for GA+KL and DPO+KL. This instability makes it challenging to obtain a competitive unlearned
model for baselines, as it becomes very difficult to choose an appropriate criterion for early stopping.

4.2
Training Efficiency

To illustrate the efficiency of ULD, we evaluate the training time of different methods on two
A100 GPUs except Offset, which requires four A100 GPUs due to out-of-memory errors
on two A100 GPUs.
Figure 5 shows the best forget quality (y-axis) for different methods
versus relative training time per epoch compared to ULD (x-axis).
ULD is the most efficient
method with more than 3 times improvement to NPO, the most efficient baseline with com-
parable forget performance.
We highlight two reasons for the improvement: ❶The LLM
involved in training has much fewer parameters for ULD. The assistant LLM only includes

8


---Page Break---
the first 8 layers of the original 32-layer LLM, which in total has 1.3B parameters, reduc-
ing more than 80% parameters, thus greatly saving the GPU computation required in training.

Figure 5: Log forget quality versus relative train-
ing time to ULD on TOFU-10%. The top-left corner
indicates better forget performance and efficiency.

❷The task of assistant LLM is less challenging and
can be effectively achieved using LoRA, which fur-
ther reduces the trainable parameters to 20M param-
eters, 0.2% of the total parameters. One may note
that the baseline methods can also employ LoRA
training on the original LLM to save training time.
However, we find that adopting LoRA harms the
overall unlearning performance for baseline meth-
ods. As shown in Figure 5, while adopting LoRA for
baselines greatly saves the training time, their forget
performance is also reduced. We also highlight that
ULD is still more efficient than LoRA-baselines since
the involved LLM has fewer parameters.

4.3
Data Usage Ablation

In addition to different training objectives, one notable difference between ULD and baseline methods
is that we adopt the augmented forget data D′
f and retain data D′
r for assistant LLM training, which
contains additional paraphrased and perturbed versions of the original forget data. To ensure a fair
comparison, we conduct two analyses of the training data: ❶We add the same augmented data for
baselines to justify that the effectiveness of ULD is not simply brought by the augmented data. ❷We
ablate the data usage for ULD to analyze how these augmentations affect the unlearning performance.
On the other hand, many conventional unlearning setting requires a canonical retain set, which
contains samples of knowledge that the LLM should not forget, whereas ULD does not. We perform
some additional studies to investigate whether ULD would benefit from incorporating such canonical
retain sets; details are in Appendix D.2.

ods on ToFU-10% with different forget/retain data

The upper panel of Table 4 presents the results for
baseline methods with augmented data D′
f and D′
r.
Notably, adding augmented data does not improve the
performance of baselines but instead hurts the model
utility, e.g., the utility for NPO+KL drops from 0.32 to
0.08, which again indicates the instability of baseline
methods. The full results are shown in Appendix D.4.

The lower panel of Table 4 presents the results on
TOFU-10% for ULD with different forget/retain data
configurations. We highlight that the augmentations
are essential for ULD. Introducing the paraphrased
Df to obtain D′
f improves the assistant LLM’s ac-
quirance of the forget knowledge and thus improves
the forget performance, where forget quality im-
proves from 1e −7 to 0.51. Introducing the perturbed
Df to obtain D′
r avoids over-fitting of the forget data
and thus improves the retain performance, where the
model utility improves from 0.53 to 0.63, close to the original LLM.

Related Work

LLM Unlearning Machine unlearning was proposed in the vision domain and mainly focuses
on the classification models [2–7]. The core unlearn algorithm requires computing the Hessian
of loss functions [2, 4], which is often intractable for LLMs due to unknown pre-train data and
the massive amount of parameters. Therefore, recent research has proposed various unlearning
objectives for finetuning target LLM, including gradient-ascent methods [9, 10, 32, 33] and preference-
loss methods [10, 11]. However, these unlearning objectives suffer from degenerated output and
catastrophic forgetting issues due to unbounded forget loss and under-representative retain data. On
the contrary, our method employs the reverse of the conventional training objective on an assistant

---Page Break---
LLM to resolve these issues. A concurrent work [19] also introduces assistant LLM for unlearning.
However, they still suffer from these issues due to using conventional unlearn objectives.

Decoding-time Steering for LLMs There is a rich literature on decoding-time steering for LLMs [17,
34–38], where a main branch is based on the idea of modifying the LLM’s output logits. To obtain
suitable logit offset for modifying the target LLM’s outputs, these methods include gradient-based
manipulation [39–41], focus vector [42, 43], model arithmetic [44–47], and contrasting outputs of two
pre-trained LLMs [14–16]. Among them, the most similar works to our method are those involving
training an assistant LLM to obtain the suitable logit offset [19, 48, 49]. However, they mainly
employ a pre-trained LLM with the same vocabulary, e.g., a 7B Llama-2 assistant for improving a
65B Llama-2 LLM, which is not practical in most cases due to the high cost of training two LLMs
separately. On the contrary, we propose a new strategy that extracts a sub-network from the target
LLM with added LoRA layers to create the assistant, which applies to all LLMs.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM unlearning framework, ULD, which involves an assistant
LLM trained with the reverse of conventional unlearning objectives ULD then derives the unlearned
LLM by computing logit difference between assistant and target LLM. This objective naturally avoids
the degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting issues that might be produced by unbounded
forget loss and unrepresentative retain documents. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of ULD. Notably, ULD loses 0% of model utility on TOFU benchmark and
achieves better forget performance. In terms of efficiency, our approach requires less than 3 times the
training time compared to other baseline methods.

7
Broad Impacts

Our work proposes an efficient and effective LLM unlearning framework ULD, which has a broad
impact on improving privacy and data leakage issues in LLM usage, making LLMs safer and more
reliable in practical application. Unlike existing unlearning methods that may sacrifice the LLM’s
overall capability to achieve the desired unlearning. Our work does not change the parameters of
original LLM and introduces an assistant LLM to help build the unlearned LLM via logit subtraction
operation. This solves the common challenges of conventional unlearning objectives that may harm
the retention of knowledge and improves the efficiency of the unlearning process.

We also note that the proposed framework is not limited to the LLM unlearning. Similar to previous
works in LLM decoding literature [14, 15], we plan to explore applying our method to other tasks
like sentiment-controlled text generation, knowledge editing, and improving LLM’s factuality.

8
Limitations

While ULD enhances the training efficiency and stability of the unlearning process, our method
involves an assistant LLM during inference, which may lead to higher inference latency. However,
this increase can be mitigated by parallelizing the computations of the assistant LLM and the
original LLM. Additionally, although forget data augmentation is crucial for improving the unlearn
performance for ULD, creating appropriate augmentations for different datasets can be challenging.
We plan to explore the automatic construction of optimal forget data construction in future work.

A
Baseline details

In this section, we first provide a summary of conventional unlearn objective functions in Section A.1
and A.2, then we discuss the offset unlearning baseline in Section A.3.

A.1
Forget losses

Gradient ascent loss
The most commonly used forget loss [9–11, 50] is to perform gradient-ascent
training on the next-token prediction loss over forget data, which is equivalent to performing gradient
descent on the negative of next-token loss. We denote this forget loss as LGA:

LGA(θ) = −E[x,y]∼Df [−log(p(y|X = x; θ))] = E[x,y]∼Df [log(p(y|X = x; θ))] .
(6)

Essentially, GA loss encourages the LLM to decrease the probability of the correct answer. As
indicated by Equation 6, the GA loss is unbounded, i.e. no minimum, and would easily diverge during
the training and thus lead to degenerated outputs.

Direct-preference optimization loss
DPO loss is another widely used forget loss [10, 11], which
approaches the LLM unlearning task by overwriting the knowledge of the target LLM and encour-
ages LLM to favor alternative responses like I don’t know over the correct answer on forget data.
Specifically, it requires another fixed dataset Didk containing all alternative responses. We denote this
loss as LDPO:

LDPO(θ) = −1

β E[x,y]∼Df ,yidk∼Didk =

log σ
 
β log p(yidk|x; θ)

p(yidk|x; θ)
|
{z
}

Increase likelihood of yidk

−β log p(y|x; θ)

p(y|x; θ)
|
{z
}
Decrease likelihood of y


,
(7)

where σ(·) is the sigmoid function, and β is a hyper-parameter controlling the preference strength. In
the LDPO loss, the two terms within the sigmoid function encourage the LLM to generate alternative
answer yidk instead of the origin answer y.3 Although DPO loss avoids the degeneration problem,
they still suffer from the catostrophic forgetting problem as the LLM may easily collapse to respond
to alternative answers to all queries, even for the retained data.

Negative-preference optimization loss
NPO loss is a variant of DPO loss proposed in a recent
work [11], which treats the preference loss as if there is no access to the alternative answer dataset,
and thus omit the yidk term in the original DPO loss. We denote this loss as LNPO:

LNPO(θ) = −2

β E[x,y]∼Df

log σ
 
−β log p(y|x; θ)

p(y|x; θ)
|
{z
}
Decrease likelihood of y


.
(8)

As indicated by Equation 8, NPO loss achieves unlearning similar to GA loss by minimizing the
likelihood of original response y. The NPO paper [11] also discuss this connection between NPO loss
and GA loss, where Equation 8 gradually approaches GA loss when β increases. As a result, NPO loss
still cannot avoid degeneration problem.

A.2
Retain losses

Gradient descent loss
The most commonly used retain loss is to simply perform gradient-descent
training on the next-token prediction loss over retain data, as this regularizes the LLM to maintain
high prediction accuracy on retain data. We denote the retain loss as LGD:

LGD(θ) = E[x,y]∼Dr [−log(p(y|x; θ))] ,
(9)

3We refer readers to Section 4 in the original DPO paper [51] for derivation details of the meaning of these
two terms.

15


---Page Break---
KL-divergence loss
KL loss is another widely used retain loss. The main idea is to maintain the
original prediction before unlearn training. Suppose the original LLM is parameterized by θ(0). We
denote the KL loss as LKL:

LKL(θ) = E[x,y]∼Dw
h
DKL

p(y|x; θ) || p(y|x; θ(0))
i
,
(10)

Although the proposed retain losses aim at preserving the LLM’s overall capability, simply combining
retain losses with the forget losses cannot avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem as the adopted
retain data Dr cannot cover all the knowledge that the original LLM contains.

A.3
Offset unlearning

A concurrent work also proposes to employ an assistant LLM to construct logit offset to perform
LLM unlearning. However, we note that their formulation of the unlearn LLM logits largely follows
the previous works [14–16], which combines the original LLM’s output logit and the difference
between the fine-tuned assistant LLM and the assistant LLM without fine-tuning. In particular, their
derived unlearn LLM logit pOffset
f
can be formulated as follows:

log pOffset
f
(Y |X) = log p(Y |X; θ) + α(log pa(Y |X; ϕ) −pa(Y |X; ϕ(0))),
(11)

where θ, ϕ, ϕ(0) are the parameters for the target LLM, fine-tuned assistant LLM and pre-trained
assistant LLM, respectively. Given the formulation in Equation 11, Offset paper directly employs
the conventional unlearn objectives in Equation 1 on the combined logits to fine-tune the assistant
LLM as follows:
min
ϕ L(ϕ) = min
ϕ −Lf(ϕ) + βLr(ϕ).
(12)

We highlight that the training objective of assistant LLM is totally different from our method and
thus cannot avoid the degeneration and catastrophic forgetting issues. The experiment results in
Section 3.2 and 3.3 also showcase the phenomenon.

Since the assistant LLM involved in Offset baseline must share the same vocabulary of the original
LLM, we choose the pre-trained version of Llama-2-chat and Mistral for TOFU and HarryPotter
experiments.

Implementation detail

B.1
Details of data augmentation

As described in Section 2, we employ GPT-3.5-turbo-1125 model to augment the original forget data
Df to obtain augmented forget data D′
f and augmented retain data D′
r. In this section, we summarize
the employed prompt and the generation procedure. We also provide the statistics of forget/retain
data for all considered unlearn settings are listed in Section B.2.

Data augmentation of TOFU
Since the TOFU dataset is formatted as question-answer (QA) pairs,
we prompt GPT-3.5-turbo to paraphrase the question and answer separately. Overall, we obtain 2
paraphrased versions of the question and answer for each QA in the forget data. They are added to
the original forget data Df to obtain D′
f. The prompt for paraphrasing the TOFU forget data is as
follows:

Please paraphrase the following sentence:
{SENTENCE}.
Make sure the paraphrased
sentence maintains the same meaning.

Figure 6: Prompt for paraphrasing QA pairs in TOFU dataset.

As we have described in Section 2, we augment the forget data with similar form but false knowledge
to create the augmented data D′
r. This prevents the assistant LLM from overfitting on always
generating the original answer for a question with a similar form but probing other knowledge.
Therefore, we prompt GPT-3.5-turbo to perturb the answer for QAs within the TOFU dataset. Overall,
we generate two perturbed answers for each QA pair.

Data augmentation of HarryPotter
Similar to the data augmentation on TOFU dataset, we prompt
GPT-3.5-turbo to paraphrase the extracted chunks of the HarryPotter book. Overall, we generate two
paraphrased versions of the original chunk. The prompt is listed below.

Details of metrics

In this section, we list the details of how to calculate the metrics described in Section 3.2 and 3.3.

Metric of TOFU dataset
We mainly adopt the metric proposed in the original TOFU paper [10].

The model utility is the aggregated metrics across multiple retain sets, including the data of remaining
fictional writers other than the authors in forget data, the QA pairs of real-world writers, and general
world facts. The model utility is defined as the harmonic average of three metrics evaluated on
the aforementioned three groups of retain data, i.e. aggregated value of nine metrics. The metrics
include ROUGE-L score between unlearned LLM generated response and ground-truth response,
the accuracy of unlearned LLM accuracy on the data, and the average truth-ratio, which is defined

by: Rtruth :=

1
N
PN
i=1 p(ˆyi|x)(1/|ˆyi|)

p(˜y|x)(1/|˜y|)
, where x, ˜y, ˆy are original questions, incorrect answers, and
paraphrased correct answers, respectively, and N is the number of incorrect answers. The rationale of
the truth ratio is that it measures how likely the unlearned LLM will give a correct answer versus an
incorrect one.

The forget quality assesses how well the unlearned LLM mimics a retrain LLM, which is trained
without the forget data. It is defined by the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) hypothesis test
between the truth ratio distribution on forget data of unlearned LLM and the truth ratio distribution of
the retrain LLM.

We refer readers to the original TOFU paper [10] for more details.

Metric of HarryPotter dataset
As described in Section 3.3, we follow previous works [18] and
measure the forget performance with the BLEU score and ROUGE score between unlearned LLM
generated completion given a length-200 prefix of an excerpt in the forget data and the ground-truth
completion as this simulates the copyright content leakage scenario in real-life LLM application. We
follow previous work [18] and use the following prompt for performing the completion:4

Let’s see how you would complete this piece of text:
{PREFIX}

Figure 9: Prompt for performing the text completion on HarryPotter dataset.

The retain performance is measured with the zero-shot accuracy over six LLM benchmarks:
BoolQ [24], RTE [25], HellaSWAG [26], ARC [27], OpenBookQA [28], and PiQA [29], as well as
the perplexity of unlearned LLM on paragraphs from the WikiText dataset [30]. Following previous
work, we follow the implementation of lm-evaluation-harness5 library to conduct the evaluation.

B.4
Hyper-parameters of baseline methods

We follow the implementations of TOFU6 and NPO7 and re-implement them. For the Offset
baseline, we did not find the official implementation and thus re-implement their method in our code
base following the original paper.

The training hyper-parameters are the same for all baselines, with batch size 32, learning rate 1e −5,
and weight decay 0.01. The retain weight is 1. We employ AdamW optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.99.
At inference time, we use greedy-decoding for unlearned LLMs following previous work.

The Offset baseline requires an assistant LLM containing the same vocabulary as the target LLM
for constructing logit offset. Therefore we use the pre-trained Llama-2-chat LLM for the TOFU
experiment and the pre-trained Mistral-7B-instruct for the HarryPotter experiment.

B.5
Hyper-parameters of ULD

We use the same assistant LLM configuration for all experiments, with r = 32, α = 32 for LoRA, and
K = 8 for the assistant LLM construction. The training hyper-parameters are as following: batch size
32, learning rate 1e −3, weight decay 0.01, and the retain weight is 6.5.

We use greedy decoding for inference and set the logit subtraction weight β = 0.75 for our method
on TOFU experiments and β = 0.5 for HarryPotter experiments. Following previous works [14–16],
we adopt the logit filter strategy to avoid logit-subtraction errors. The filter rate is set to be 1e −2 for
all experiments.

B.6
Hardware configuration

We conduct all experiments on two A100-80G GPUs except for the Offset baseline, which requires
four A100-80G GPUs to avoid out-of-memory errors. All experiments are conducted with torch 2.2
and CUDA 12.1. We employ flash-attention-2 2.5.7 to improve the training and inference efficiency.
We employ DeepSpeed ZeRO stage-3 [52] for all baselines to compress GPU memory following the
previous implementation released by TOFU and NPO paper. We did not employ it for ULD since the
peak GPU memory in training does not exceed the maximum GPU memory size.

Additional experiment results

In this section, we include more experiment results and analysis, including the effect of optimizing
forget loss against uniform distribution in Section D.1, the effect of retain data about knowledge to
retain on ULD in Section D.2, , additional full results for the training stability analysis in Section D.3,
and data usage ablation in Section D.4.

D.1
Effect of optimizing forget loss against uniform distribution

We note that there exists a series of heuristic objectives that solve the unbounded issue we discussed
in Section 2, for example, optimizing the forget loss against a pre-defined distribution such as the
uniform distribution. However, it is very difficult to determine a proper target distribution for the
target LLM, because it is impossible to directly measure the “ground-truth forget distribution” without
obtaining a perfect forget model, which is a “chicken-and-egg” problem.

Similar to the uniform distribution, another work also proposes a heuristic target distribution that adds
a positive offset to the logits of all non-target tokens in the original LLM’s output distribution [12].
However, neither of the two target distributions is suitable: ❶The uniform distribution, as suggested
by the reviewer, is not a good choice because it flattens out the general linguistic information and
greatly lowers retain performance. ❷The offset distribution is sensitive to the choice of offset value.

We compare ULD with the two methods based on ToFU-10% setting. The results are shown in
Table 8, where the uniform distribution is denoted as Uniform-GD and Uniform-KL, and offset
target distribution is denoted as DI. As shown in the table, our method achieves better performance
and can effectively remove the knowledge desired to forget with the flipped objective. ULD bypass
the unclear target distribution problem because it does not attempt to figure out the forget distribution
but seeks to remember the forget knowledge, which comes with a well-defined target distribution.

As we mentioned in Section 2, ULD requires an augmented retain set, which is composed of two parts:
❶Regular retain set, which contains samples about the retained knowledge; ❷Augmented retain set,
which contains perturbed samples derived from the forget data. We have discussed the effect of all
augmented retain set in Section 4.3. In this section, we ablate the effect of regular retain set for ULD.

The augmented retain set serves a very different purpose from the retain set for conventional unlearn-
ing objectives. Rather than covering the retain knowledge, the augmented retain set aims to define the
boundary of the forget knowledge, which is a specific need of our approach. This boundary is crucial
because, when the assistant method learns the forget knowledge, it may generalize to neighboring
knowledge. The augmented retain set essentially directs the assistant model to learn the forget
knowledge only and not the neighboring one. Therefore, representativeness is not a requirement for
the augmented retain set. Another advantage is that the augmented retain set requires only perturbed
versions of the forget data and does not need to include any actual retain data.

On the other hand, the regular retain set needs to represent the retain knowledge, which causes the
under-representative retain loss challenge as we discussed in Section 2. Here, we argue that ULD is
not sensitive to the regular retain set, and can even get rid of it. To validate this, we conduct additional
experiments on TOFU, where we keep our original augmented retain set but reduce the size of the
regular retain set to 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% of its original size. Results in Table 9 indicate that this

reduction has minimal impact on the model utility of our method, and the final forget performance
still outperforms most baselines with the full retain dataset.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We make main claims in Introduction 1, and the experiment results showcase
the efficiency and effectiveness of our method (Section 3).
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitation of our work in Section 8.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

25


---Page Break---
Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss our method detail in Section 2 and list all hyper-parameters for
baseline and our method in Appendix B. We will make the code publicly available upon
paper acceptance for better reproducibility.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

26


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss our method detail in Section 2 and list all hyper-parameters for
baseline and our method in Appendix B. We will make the code publicly available upon
paper acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We introduce the training details in Section 3 and list all hyper-parameters for
baseline and our method in Appendix B. We will make the code publicly available upon
paper acceptance, and the code is included in the supplementary materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Due to the high computation cost of running the involved experiments, we
cannot conduct enough experiments for computing a meaningful statistical significance test.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

27


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We list the hardware configuration and code base information in Appendix B

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the data and models we employ in the experiment are open-source and
public for research purposes. The problem we focus on does not break any ethical consid-
erations listed in the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. The proposed algorithm can help improve
privacy and fair data usage in LLM applications.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the potential societal impact of our work in Section 7.

Guidelines:

28


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the information to the datasets and models related to our work
in the experiment section 3 and implementation detail section B, including pre-trained
open-source LLM Llama-2-7b-chat and Mistral-7B-instruct. The datasets we use are all
open source and can be used for research purposes. Links to these resources are included.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

29


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [TODO]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

30


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
