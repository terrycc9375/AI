Abstract

Occupancy prediction, aiming at predicting the occupancy status within voxelized
3D environment, is quickly gaining momentum within the autonomous driving
community. Mainstream occupancy prediction works first discretize the 3D envi-
ronment into voxels, then perform classification on such dense grids. However,
inspection on sample data reveals that the vast majority of voxels is unoccupied.
Performing classification on these empty voxels demands suboptimal computa-
tion resource allocation, and reducing such empty voxels necessitates complex
algorithm designs. To this end, we present a novel perspective on the occupancy
prediction task: formulating it as a streamlined set prediction paradigm without
the need for explicit space modeling or complex sparsification procedures. Our
proposed framework, called OPUS, utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder archi-
tecture to simultaneously predict occupied locations and classes using a set of
learnable queries. Firstly, we employ the Chamfer distance loss to scale the set-
to-set comparison problem to unprecedented magnitudes, making training such
model end-to-end a reality. Subsequently, semantic classes are adaptively assigned
using nearest neighbor search based on the learned locations. In addition, OPUS
incorporates a suite of non-trivial strategies to enhance model performance, includ-
ing coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling, and adaptive re-weighting,
etc. Finally, compared with current state-of-the-art methods, our lightest model
achieves superior RayIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset at near 2× FPS, while
our heaviest model surpasses previous best results by 6.1 RayIoU.

Introduction

Compared with well-established box representations [8, 23, 20, 39, 29, 48, 32], voxel based occu-
pancy [16, 37, 10, 38, 33] can provide finer geometry and semantic information for the surrounding
scene. For example, it is not straightforward to use bounding boxes to describe vehicles with doors
open or cranes with outriggers deployed. While occupancy can naturally describe such uncommon
shapes. Thus occupancy prediction is quickly gaining traction in the autonomous driving community.

Recent approaches [3, 46, 9, 27, 16, 34] to the task predominantly rely on dense data representation,
with a direct one-to-one correspondence between feature points and physical voxels. It has come to
our attention that the vast majority of physical voxels is empty. For instance, in SemanticKITTI [1],
approximately 67% of all voxels are empty, while in Occ3D-nuScenes [38], this proportion exceeds
90%. Such sparse nature of occupancy data renders the direct dense representation undeniably
inefficient, as majority of the computation is allocated towards empty voxels. Alternative sparse latent
representations have been explored to alleviate such inefficiency, such as the Tri-Perspective View
representation [37, 9] or reduced solution spaces [21, 10], leading to notably reduced computational
costs. However, these approaches still treat occupancy prediction as a classification problem at
specific locations, necessitating complex intermediate designs and explicit modeling of 3D spaces.

Figure 1: The occupancy prediction is approached as a set prediction problem. For each scene,
we predict a set of point positions P and a set of the corresponding semantic classes C. With the
ground-truth set of occupied voxel positions Pg and classes Cg, we decouple the set-to-set matching
task into two distinct components: (a) Enforcing similarity in the point distributions of P and Pg using
the Chamfer distance. (b) Aligning the predicted classes C with the ground-truths ˆC = Φ(P, Pg, Cg),
where Φ generates a set of classes for points P based on those of the nearest ground-truth points.

In this work, we instead formulate the task as a direct set prediction problem, where we regress
occupied locations and classify corresponding semantic labels in parallel. Our proposed framework
termed OPUS leverages a transformer encoder-decoder architecture featuring: (1) an image encoder to
extract 2D features from multi-view images; (2) a set of learnable queries to predict occupied locations
and semantic classes; (3) a sparse decoder to update query features with correlated image features. Our
OPUS eliminates the need for explicit space modeling or complex sparsification procedures, offering
a streamlined and elegant end-to-end solution. However, a key challenge lies in matching predictions
with ground-truths, especially given the unordered nature of predicted results. We argue that the
Hungarian algorithm [12], although widely adopted in the DETR families [5, 47, 28, 22, 13, 42], is not
suitable for this task. Having a O(n3) time complexity and a O(n2) space complexity, the Hungarian
algorithm is unable to handle a substantial number of voxels. In our experiments, associating two sets
with 10K points each, the Hungarian algorithm consumes approximately 24 seconds and 2,304Mb
of GPU memory on a 80G A100 GPU. In reality, the voxel number can go up to ∼70K in the
Occ3D-nuScenes [38] dataset. Thus directly applying the Hungrian algorithm for set-to-set matching
is infeasible in the occupancy prediction context.

But is accurate one-to-one association truly necessary for occupancy prediction? We recognize that
the goal of one-to-one correspondence between prediction results and ground-truth annotation is to
obtain supervision signals, essentially complete, precise point locations, and accurate point classes.
The heavylifting of one-to-one association can be entirely avoided if we can obtain such supervision
signals elsewhere. Therefore, we propose to decouple the occupancy prediction task into two parallel
subtasks, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The first task obtains supervision on point locations by aligning
predicted point distributions with ground-truths, a task achievable through the Chamfer distance loss,
a well-established technique for point clouds [6, 30]. The second task obtains supervision on point
classes by assigning semantic labels to predicted points. This is accomplished by assigning each
point the class of its nearest neighbor in the ground-truths. It’s noteworthy that all operations involved
can be executed in parallel and are highly efficient on GPU devices. As a result, a single matching in
Occ3D-nuScenes can be processed within milliseconds, with negligible memory consumption. With
a time complexity of O(n2) and space complexity of O(n), our formulation breaks the ground for
large-scale training for the occupancy prediction models.

In addition, we propose several strategies to further boost the performance of occupancy prediction in
our end-to-end sparse formulation, including coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling, and
adaptive loss re-weighting. On Occ3D-nuScenes, all our model variants easily surpass all prior work,
verifying the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed method. Especially, our most lightweight
model achieves a 3.3 absolute RayIoU improvement compared with SparseOcc [21] while operating
more than 2× faster. The heaviest configuration ultimately achieves a RayIoU of 41.2, establishing a
new upper bound with a 14% advantage. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we view the occupancy prediction as a direct
set prediction problem, facilitating end-to-end training of the sparse framework.

• Several non-trivial strategies, including coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling,
and adaptive re-weighting, are further introduced for boosting the performance of OPUS.

methods in terms of RayIoU results, while maintain a real-time inference speed.

Occupancy prediction

Occupancy prediction entails determining the occupancy status and class of each voxel within a 3D
space. This task has recently become a foundational perception task in autonomous driving and raises
great interests from both academic and industrial communities. Conventional methods [3, 46, 9, 27,
16, 41, 38, 4] typically employ the continuous and dense feature representation, which, however,
suffer from computational redundancy due to the inherent sparsity of occupancy data. In addressing
this issue, Tang et al. [37] compresses the dense feature using the Tri-Perspective View representation
for model efficiency. Recently, several transformer-based approaches [21, 10, 14] with sparse queries
have emerged. For example, OccupancyDETR [10] conducts object detection followed by assigning
each object with one query for occupancy completion. VoxFormer [14] generates 3D voxels from
a set of sparse queries, corresponding to occupied locations identified through a pre-task of depth
estimation. Meanwhile, SparseOcc [21] employs a series of sparse voxel decoders to filter out empty
grids and predict occupied statuses of retained voxels in each stage. While these approaches have
succeeded in reducing computational costs, they often necessitate multi-stage processes and intricate
space modeling. In contrast, our method directly applies sparse queries to regress the occupied
locations without pre-defined locations, facilitating an elegant and end-to-end occupancy prediction.

2.2
Set prediction with transformers

The concept of directly predicting sets with Transformers was initially introduced by DETR [5],
where a set of sparse queries generates unordered detection results with feature and object interactions.
By viewing the object detection as a direct set prediction problem, DETR eliminates the need for
complex post-processing, enabling end-to-end performance. Following DETR, numerous variants [47,
28, 22, 13, 42, 45, 36] have been proposed for performance improvements and efficient training. The
effectiveness of the sparse-query-based paradigm has also been validated in 3D object detection [43,
23, 18–20, 40], where 3D information is encoded into the queries. For example, DETR3D [43]
employs a sparse set of 3D object queries to index 2D features, linking 3D positions to multi-view
images using camera transformation matrices. PETR [23] generates 3D position-aware features by
encoding 3D position embedding into 2D image features, enabling queries to directly aggregate
features without the 3D-to-2D projection. Sparse4D [18] further advances sparse 3D object detection
by refining detection results with spatial-temporal feature fusion. Despite of the great success, set
prediction with Transformers remains restricted primarily to object detection, where the query number
are typically small due to the limited object number in a scene. Extending this approach to occupancy
prediction poses a big challenge due to the substantially larger number of queries required.

Methodology

In this part, we first recap current query-based sparsification approaches for occupancy prediction
in Sec. 3.1. Then, Sec. 3.2 describes our formulation that views the task as a direct set prediction
problem. Finally, we detail the proposed OPUS framework in Sec. 3.3.

3.1
Revisiting query-based occupancy sparsification

Transformers with sparse queries offer a promising avenue for tackling the inherent sparsity in
occupancy representation. A notable approach to reduce the number of queries is allocating each
query to a patch of voxels rather than a single voxel, as presented in PETRv2 [24]. However,
this method still generates a dense prediction of the 3D space, thus failing to efficiently address
the redundancy issue. Alternatively, VoxFormer [14] and SparseOcc [21] allocate sparse queries
exclusively to occupied voxels. VoxFormer employs a depth estimation module to identify potentially
occupied voxels, while SparseOcc utilizes multiple stages to progressively filter out empty regions.
Nonetheless, their sparsification processes rely on accurately recognizing the occupancy status of
voxels and therefore suffer from the cumulative errors. Moreover, their pipelines necessitate intricate
intermediate descriptions of the 3D space, hindering seamless end-to-end operation.

The dilemmas of current approaches significantly stem from treating the task as a classification
problem, where each query is confined to a specific physical region for classifying the semantic
labels. This constraint severely limits query flexibility, preventing adaptive focus on suitable areas. To
address this, we propose to remove this restriction by allowing each query to autonomously determine
its relevant area. In the end, we view occupancy prediction as a direct set prediction problem, where
each query predicts point positions and semantic classes, simultaneously.

3.2
A set prediction problem
At the core of our work lies the conceptualization of occupancy prediction as a set prediction task. We
denote the Vg occupied voxels in the ground-truth as {Pg, Cg}, where |Pg| = |Cg| = Vg. For each
entry in {pg, cg} ∈{Pg, Cg}, pg represents the 3D coordinates of a voxel center, while cg stores the
semantic class of the corresponding voxel. Given the predictions {P, C} of V points, our primary
challenge is to devise an effective strategy for set-to-set matching. In other words, we must determine
how to supervise the training of unordered predictions with the ground-truth data. One alternative
is to adopt the Hungarian algorithm. However, our previous discussions and experiments in the
appendix reveal its scalability limitations. Rather than pursuing one-to-one associations between
the predictions and ground-truths, we recognize the matching essentially aims at accurate locations
and classes in predictions. This motivates us to decouple the task into two parallel objectives: (1)
Encouraging the predicted locations to be precise and comprehensive. (2) Ensuring the predicted
points are assigned with proper semantic classes from the ground-truth labels.

The first objective focuses on aligning distributions between predicted and ground-truth points,
a task achievable through the Chamfer distance loss which is well-proved in the field of point
clouds [6, 30, 11, 44]:

CD(P, Pg) = 1

|P|

X

p∈P
D(p, Pg) +
1
|Pg|

X

pg∈Pg
D(pg, P), where D(x, Y) = min
y∈Y ||x −y||1.
(1)

Minimizing Chamfer distance leads to similar distributions of predictions and ground-truths, enabling
direct learning of occupied voxels without necessitating knowledge of their orders.

Concerning the second objective, although direct comparison between C and Cg is invalid due to
their correspondence to different locations, we can leverage the spatial locality properties of voxels to
find a proxy. Nearby points belonging to the same object usually carry the same semantic labels, thus
we propose assigning each predicted point the class of its nearest neighbor voxel in the ground-truth:

{ˆC, ˆP} =
n
arg min{cg,pg}∈{Cg,Pg}∥pg −p∥2,
p ∈P
o
.
(2)

Here, ˆC is the updated classes that are prepared to supervise the learning of the predicted C.

It’s noteworthy that computations of both Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) can be executed efficiently and in
parallel on GPU devices. As a result, a single matching can be swiftly processed within milliseconds,
enabling feasibility of the large-scale training by viewing the occupancy prediction task as a direct
set prediction problem. Next, we delve into the specifics of the proposed OPUS framework.

3.3
Details of OPUS
This part describes OPUS framework, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Initially, image features are extracted
from multi-view images. And a set of learnable queries Q, point positions P, and scores C are
initialized. Subsequently, these query features and prediction outcomes are fed into a sequence of
decoders, undergoing iterative refinement through correlation with image features. At each stage,
predicted positions and scores are supervised by the ground-truths, facilitating end-to-end training for
the entire framework. It can be observed that our most important structure is the sequence of multiple
decoders. Therefore, we next provide a detailed description to the inputs/outputs of the decoders and
how features are aggregated and updated within the decoders.

Notations. Denote the set of learnable queries, point positions, and point scores as {Q0, P0, C0}
before feeding into decoders, and as {Qi, Pi, Ci} for the outcomes of the i-th decoder. The length
of these sets is all Q, which corresponds to the number of queries. Each query feature qi ∈Qi, i ∈
{0, 1, · · · , 6} has a channel size C, set to 256 in our implementation. To reduce the number of
queries, which is a bottleneck for model efficiency, each query qi predicts Ri points rather than
a single one. Consequently, pi ∈Pi and ci ∈Ci have shapes of Q × Ri × 3 and Q × Ri × N,
respectively. Here, N represents the number of semantic classes.

Figure 2: OPUS leverages a transformer encoder-decoder architecture comprising: (1) An image
encoder to extract 2D features from multi-view images. (2) A series of decoders to refine the queries
with image features, which are correlated via the consistent point sampling module. (3) A set of
learnable queries to predict locations and classes of occupancy points. Each query obeys a coarse-
to-fine rule, progressively increasing the number of predicted points. In the end, the entire model is
trained end-to-end using our adaptively re-weighted set-to-set losses.

Coarse-to-fine prediction. High-level semantic information can be difficult to predict accurately
from just low-level features. Therefore, instead of attempting to predict occupancy for the entire 3D
environment, we allow the model to predict "sparse" occupancy results in early stages, as shown in
Fig. 2. To achieve this, we follow a coarse-to-fine strategy, gradually increasing the number of points
generated from one query. In other words, we always have Ri−1 ≤Ri for i ∈{1, 2, · · · , 6}.

It’s noteworthy that the Chamfer distance has another advantage over the Hungarian algorithm here:
even when the number of predictions is smaller than that of the ground-truths, the assignment won’t
collapse into a local shape of the ground-truths. This is because the Hungarian algorithm could assign
the predictions to any subset of the ground-truths due to its lack of distribution constraints. In contrast,
the Chamfer distance maintains a global perspective, considering the overall distribution of points
rather than enforcing a strict one-to-one correspondence. This ensures that the predicted points are
more evenly distributed and representative of the actual 3D environment, even when fewer in number.

Details of the decoder. Our decoder is analogous to that in SparseBEV [20], a performant and
sparse object detector. For a given query qi−1 ∈Qi−1 and its corresponding point locations
pi−1 ∈Pi−1, the i-th decoder first aggregates image features through a consistent point sampling,
a new scheme elaborated in our subsequent discussion. Subsequently, the query feature is updated
into qi with the adaptive mixing of image and query features, along with the self-attention among all
queries, mirroring operations in SparseBEV. In the end, a prediction module, comprising only Linear,
LayerNorm, and ReLU layers, generates the semantic classes ci (size Ri ×N) and the position offsets
∆pi (size Ri × 3). As the ∆pi cannot be directly added to pi−1 due to dimension misalignment, we
first compute the mean of pi−1 along the first dimension and then duplicate the results by Ri times
into ¯pi−1. The final position pi is computed as pi = ¯pi−1 + ∆pi.

Consistent point sampling. The feature sampling method utilized in SparseBEV is not applicable
for our method as it is specifically designed for detection inputs. Therefore, we propose a novel
process of Consistent Point Sampling (CPS), aiming at sampling 3D points and aggregating features
from M image features. Given input {q, p} ∈{Q, P}, we sample S points and find their respective
coordinates in the m-th image feature by the following equation:

cm = Tmr, where r = mp + ϕ(q) · σp,
(3)

where Tm represents the projection matrix from current 3D space into the m-th image’s coordinates.
ϕ(q) generates S 3D points from the query feature q using a linear layer. mp and σp denote the mean

5


---Page Break---
and standard deviation, respectively, of the R points in p. It’s worthy to note that we re-weight the
predicted offsets ϕ(q) with the standard deviation σp to inherent the dispersion degree from previous
predictions. In essence, we tend to sample more aggressively if the input p contains diverse points,
and sample points in a narrower range otherwise. This operation can evidently enhance the prediction
performance, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Not all coordinates in cm are feasible since the sampled points might not be visible within the
corresponding camera. Therefore, we generate a mask set Vm where the s-th value is 1 if cs,m
is valid and 0 otherwise, for s ∈{1, 2, · · · , S} and m ∈{1, 2, · · · , M}. Next, we aggregate
information from image features {Fm}M
1 for the later adaptively mixing stage. Specifically, we have

fs =

PM
m=1 |Vm|

S
X

s=1

M
X

m=1
ws,m · vs,m · B(Fm, cs,m),
(4)

where vs,m denotes the s-th element in Vm and cs,m is the coordinates of the s-th point rs mapped
into the m-th image feature. The operation B refers to the bilinear interpolation. ws,m is the weight
for the rs on the m-th image feature, generated from the query feature q by linear transformation.

The training loss with adaptively re-weighting. The training object of our framework is to supervise
the learning of {Pi, Ci}6
i=1 with the ground-truth {Pg, Cg}. Point positions can be trained with Eq. (1).
However, the original Chamfer distance loss focuses on the overall similarity of point distributions,
neglecting whether each individual is good enough. This leads to unsatisfactory performance, as
observed in our experiments. To cope with this issue, we employ a simple but effective re-weighting
strategy to emphasize erroneous points, and modify the Chamfer distance loss as follows:

CDR(P, Pg) = 1

|P|

X

p∈P
DR(p, Pg) +
1
|Pg|

X

pg∈Pg
DR(pg, P),

where DR(x, Y) = W(d) · d with d = min
y∈Y ||x −y||1.
(5)

Here, W(d) is the re-weighting function penalizing points with large distance to the closest ground-
truths. In our implementation, we use a step function of W(d) being 5 if d ≥0.2 and 1 otherwise.

For the classification, we first generate the target classes ˆCi for Ci using Eq. (2). Subsequently, the
semantic classes can be trained with the conventional classification losses. In our implementation,
we adopt the focal loss [17] with mannually searched weights on different categories and denote the
modified loss as FocalLossR. In the end, the training objective of the proposed OPUS becomes

LOPUS = CDR(P0, Pg) +

6
X

i=1
(CDR(Pi, Pg) + FocalLossR(Ci, ˆCi)),
(6)

where CDR(P0, Pg) explicitly encourages initial points P0 to capture a general pattern of the dataset.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental setup
Dataset and metrics. All models are evaluated on the Occ3D-nuScenes [38] dataset, which pro-
vides occupancy labels for 18 classes (1 free class and 17 semantic classes) on the large-scale
nuScenes [2] benchmark. Out of the 1,000 labeled driving scenes, 750/150/150 are used for train-
ing/validation/testing, respectively. The commonly used mIoU metric is utilized for evaluation.
Recently, SparseOcc [21] points that that overestimation can easily hack the mIoU metric and pro-
poses RayIoU as a remedy. Therefore, following their work, we also report the RayIoU results under
different distance thresholds at 1, 2, and 4 meters, denoted as RayIoU1m, RayIoU2m, and RayIoU4m,
respectively. The final RayIoU score is the average of these three values.

Implementation details. Following previous works [21, 16, 8], we resize images to 704 × 256 and
extract features using a ResNet50 [7] backbone. We denote a series of models as OPUS-T, OPUS-S,
OPUS-M and OPUS-L, with 0.6K, 1.2K, 2.4K and 4.8K queries, respectively. In each model, all
queries predict an equal number of points, totalling 76.8K points in the final stage. The sampling
number in our CPS is 4 for OPUS-T and 2 for other models. Please refer to Appendix D.2 for more
details of different models. All models are trained on 8 nvidia 4090 GPUs with a batch size of 8
using the AdamW [26] optimizer. The learning rate warms up to 2e−4 in the first 500 iterations and
then decays with a Cosine Annealing [25] scheme. Unless otherwise stated, models in main results
are trained for 100 epochs and those in the ablation study are trained for 12 epochs.

Main results
Quantitative Performances. In this part, we compare OPUS with previous state-of-the-art methods
on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset. Our methods not only achieves the superior performances in terms of
RayIoU and competitive results in mIoU, but also demonstrates commendable real-time performance.
As depicted in Tab. 1, OPUS-T (8f) reaches 22.4 FPS, significantly faster than dense counterparts and
nearly 1.3 times the speed of sparse counterpart SparseOcc (8f). Despite using only 7 history frames,
its 38.4 RayIoU result easily outperforms other models, including FB-Occ (16f) with RayIoU of
33.5(−4.9) and SparseOcc (16f) with RayIoU of 35.1(−3.3). Similarly, OPUS-S (8f) and OPUS-M
(8f) achieve a good balance between performance and efficiency. The heaviest version of OPUS
ultimately achieves an RayIoU of 41.2, surpassing the previous best result by a notable margin of 6.1.

With the same total number of points predicted, we vary the query number and correspondingly change
the number of points from each query, leading to different versions of OPUS. It can be observed that
increasing the query number decreases the FPS values from 22.4 to 7.2, while simultaneously boosts
model performance in terms of mIoU and RayIoU. The OPUS-M (8f), with 2.4K queries, strikes a
balance by achieving a comparable RayIoU while maintaining competitive FPS.

Despite the vulnerability of mIoU metric to overestimation manipulations [21], our OPUS attains a
comparable mIoU of 36.2, significantly bridging the gap between dense and sparse models in this
metric. These results under different metrics collectively demonstrate the superiority of our OPUS.

Visualization. We visualize the predicted occupancy in Fig. 3. It can be observed that FB-Occ
tends to produce denser results compared to sparse methods. Though seems complete in the 3D
environment, its predicted occupancy results are severely over-estimated, especially for the far areas.
The overestimation may hack the mIoU metric [21], while heavily penalized by RayIoU that primarily
considers the first occupied voxels along rays. Consequently, FB-Occ achieves the best mIoU of
39.1 but the worst RayIoU value. On the other hand, SparseOcc occasionally exhibits discontinuous
predictions with false negatives, especially in long distances. This is attributed to SparseOcc’s gradual
removal of empty voxels, making erroneous filtering in early stages accumulates and contributes to
the final false predictions. In contrast, our OPUS maintains a more continuous prediction thanks to
its end-to-end approach, resulting in a more reasonable visualization.

Effects of the proposed strategies in OPUS. In our work, we introduce adaptive re-weighting for
the Chamfer distance loss and focal loss, along with consistent point sampling, and coarse-to-fine
prediction strategies. We examine the impacts of these strategies as shown in Tab. 2. Without bells and
whistles, OPUS achieves a baseline 17.4 mIoU and a 29.2 RayIoU. Replacing the original CD loss
into our revision CDR significantly boosts the mIoU and RayIoU by 6.4 and 0.9, respectively, demon-
strating the importance of focusing on erroneous predicted locations in this task. The FocalLossR
further improves both metrics by 1.4. Incorporating the term σp in Eq. (3) further enhances mIoU
and RayIoU by 0.4 and 0.8, demonstrating the efficacy of considering previous point distribution in
the current sampling process. The proposed coarse-to-fine query prediction gradually increases the
number of points across the stages. This scheme not only reduces computations in early stages but
also notably benefits model performance, particularly in mIoU, which is increased by 1.7. These
results highlight the cumulative benefits of each component, showcasing how their integration leads
to substantial performance gains.

Visualization on the coarse-to-fine prediction. We visualize the prediction results at different stages
in Fig. 4. In the baseline scenario depicted in Fig. 4(a), where all decoders regress the same number
of points, we observe inconsistent point distributions across stages and numerous false negative
predictions in long distances, as highlighted by circles. This may be attributed to the difficulty of
learning the fine-grained occupancy representations in the early stages, impeding the efficient training
of the entire framework. In contrast, our coarse-to-fine strategy significantly alleviates the learning
difficulty in early stages, thereby leading to improved model performances. As a result, the point
distributions are more consistent among different stages, and the final predictions exhibit much fewer
false negatives, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b).

Figure 5: Distributions of standard
deviations of points from one query.

Visualizations of predicted points. In Fig. 6, we select a
few queries and visualize their predicted points. Notably,
most queries exhibit a tendency to predict points with con-
sistent classes, or even from the same instance, as depicted
in Fig. 6(a)-(g). An interesting observation is that the pre-
dicted points tend to exhibit diverse distributions in classes
with large volumes, such as drivable surfaces and sidewalks.
Conversely, for objects with limited sizes, such as traffic cones,
motorcycles, and cars, the points are distributed more closely
with respect to the instance size. The patterns can be further
verified by Fig. 5, where we present the standard deviations of
points from queries with three chosen classes. These results
highlight the efficacy of our model in adapting its predictions
to the distinct spatial characteristics of various object classes.

As we do not explicitly constrain points from one query to have the same class, it’s conceivable
that one query could yield points of different classes. We found this phenomenon commonly occurs
at the boundaries between objects. However, even when classes vary, these points are still closely
distributed, as depicted in Fig. 6(h)-(j).

Influence of treatments on the initial points. Tab. 3 compares three different treatments on the initial
points P0. Grid initialization divides the BEV space into evenly-distributed pillars and orderly assigns
pillar centers as the initial locations, a method utilized in BEVFormer [15]. Random initialization
assigns each location with a uniform distribution in the 3D space. After initialization, P0 remains
learnable during training. On top of the random initialization, our OPUS further add supervisions
of the ground-truth distributions to P0 (i.e., CDR(P0, Pg) in Eq. (6)). The results in Tab. 4 show
that random initialization outperforms grid initialization, achieving an mIoU of 23.1 compared to
22.8, and a RayIoU of 29.9 compared to 28.3. This improvement is likely due to the fact the random
initialization provides a more diverse 3D distribution. Furthermore, the introduced supervision results
in additional improvements of 0.6 on mIoU and 0.2 on RayIoU. These results reveal the efficiency of
the random initialization and the additional supervision on the initial locations.

Visualization of the self-attention. For better understanding what query points attend to, we visualize
top 10 query points with highest self attention weights for each query. We project them on 2D image
for better visualization. Here are some interesting finding from Fig. 7. Generally speaking, the query
tends to attend to neighbouring query points. For example, the sidewalk query in the first image
and the car query in the second image, allow local information from neighbouring query points flow
into, enabling the query to capture detailed local information. Additionally, the query maintains the
ability to attend to semantic related locations even if they are not very close to the query point. For
instance, the vegetation query in the first image of Fig. 7 not only attends to the stem of the tree,
but also the grass, indicating that the query can capture semantically related information for more
accurate predictions. Another notable observation is that query can sense terrain-related information.
For instance, in the third image, the sidewalk query points attend to other points along a straight line
following the road’s edge, highlighting the model’s ability to understand scene related structure of
the environment.

Comparisons between different sparsification strategies In Tab. 4, we compare OPUS to two
other models with different sparsification strategies. The first baseline is SparseOcc, which achieves
sparsification by filtering out empty voxels at various cascade stages. Following PETRv2 [24], the
second baseline is a pillar-patch based method that partitions the 3D space into a small number of
pillar-patches. We use 50 × 50 queries with each corresponding to the classification of neighbouring
4 × 4 × 16 voxels. For a fair comparison, all these models are trained for 100 epochs. In contrast, our
model achieve best results after sufficient training with a RayIoU score of 38.0,far outperforming
SparseOcc with a RayIoU score of 34.3. On the other hand, our model can also runs in a real-time
speed. These results demonstrates the superiority of our sparification procedure.

Comparisons on the Waymo-Occ3D dataset. We further simply implement OPUS on the Waymo-
Occ3D [35] dataset to explore the generalization and robustness of OPUS. As Waymo-Occ3D is
not commonly used as a standard benchmark for vision-centric approaches, the only vision-based
method we found with reported results on this dataset is the Occ3D paper, which evaluates BEVDet,
TPVFormer, BEVFormer, and the newly proposed CTF-Occ [38]. We trained the OPUS-L (1f)
on 20% of the dataset for a fair comparison with these baselines. As reported in Tab. 5, despite
not fine-tuning the training configurations, OPUS-L already achieves 19.0 mIoU, outperforming all
previous methods. Moreover, OPUS-L also reaches 8.5 FPS on the Waymo-Occ3D dataset, which is
around 3 times the speed of CTF-Occ and 2 times the speed of BEVFormer.

Conclusions and limitations

This paper introduces a novel perspective on occupancy prediction by framing it as a direct set predic-
tion problem. Using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture, the proposed OPUS directly predicts
occupied locations and classes in parallel from a set of learnable queries. The matching between
predictions and ground truths is accomplished through two efficient tasks in parallel, facilitating
end-to-end training with a large number of points in this application. In addition, the query features
are enhanced via a list of non-trivial designs (i.e., coarse-to-fine learning, consistent point sampling,
and loss re-weighting), and therefore leads to boosted prediction performances. Our experiments on
the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OPUS surpasses all prior arts in terms of both
accuracy and efficiency, thanks to the sparse designs in our framework.

However, the proposed OPUS also comes with new challenges, particularly regarding the convergence
speed. The slow convergence may potentially be alleviated by drawing lessons from follow-up works
of DETR, which have largely addressed the convergence issue of the original DETR. Another
challenge is that while sparse approaches typically achieve higher RayIoU compared to dense
counterparts, they often struggle with the mIoU metric. Improving the mIoU performance while
maintaining superior RayIoU results is a promising direction for future works. Moreover, despite
conducting experiments on vision-only datasets, our core formulation is directly applicable to multi-
modal tasks as well. We leave the multi-modal occupancy prediction as future work.

Appendix

A
Broader impacts

Our work proposes an end-to-end paradigm for occupancy prediction, achieving state-of-the-art
RayIoU performance with fast inference speeds. This advancement can lead to real-time and precise
occupancy outcomes, which are crucial for real-world applications of autonomous driving (AD).
Consequently, the most significant positive impact of our work is the enhancement of safety and
response speed in AD systems.

However, the biggest negative societal impact of this work, as with any component of AD systems, is
the safety concern. Autonomous driving systems are directly related to human lives, and erroneous
predictions or decisions can lead to hazardous outcomes. Therefore, increasing the accuracy of
occupancy outcomes and developing complementary methods to address false predictions will require
substantial follow-up efforts.

B
Licenses for involved assets

Our code is built on top of the codebase1 provided by SparseBEV [20], which is subject to the MIT
license. Our experiments are conducted on the Occ3D-nuScenes [38] which provides occupancy
labels for the nuScenes dataset [2]. Occ3D-nuScenes is licensed under the MIT license, and nuScenes
is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

C
Complexity analysis

In this part, we provide a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity involved in matching m
predictions with n ground-truths.

Hungarian algorithm. The Hungarian algorithm’s core involves finding augmenting paths for
min(m, n) iterations. Each iteration can be visualized as an attempt to improve the current match-
ing by finding the shortest augmenting path in the residual graph, which has a complexity of
O(max(m, n)2) using with Dijkstra’s algorithm. Consequently, the time complexity for the Hungar-
ian algorithm is O(min(m, n) · max(m, n)2).

Meanwhile, the Hungarian Algorithm necessitates computing a cost matrix of size m × n to store the
costs linked with each potential assignment. Throughout the matching process, the tracked labels and
matched pairs each demand O(min(m, n)) space. Hence, the final space complexity is O(m × n).

Our method. Our method employs the Chamfer distance loss, which involves computing pair-
wise distances and determining the smallest distance for each point. The first step requires a time
complexity of O(m × n) and the next step requires O(m × n) as well. The assignment of semantic
labels can re-use the results of previous nearest search, therefore requires no additional computations.
In the end, the time complexity is O(m × n).

For each point in one set, the algorithm needs to keep track of the minimum distance to any point in
the other set. This can be done using a single variable per point, resulting in O(m) and O(n) in the
respective directions. Semantic label assignment, meanwhile, incurs a space complexity of O(m).
Collectively, this sums up to O(2m + n).

Comparison of the two methods. In conclusion, when m and n are comparable in scale, the
Hungarian algorithm exhibits time complexity of O(n3) and space complexity of O(n2), whereas
our method demonstrates significantly improved efficiencies with complexities of O(n2) and O(n),
respectively. This represents a notable reduction in both time and space requirements, making it a
more efficient solution for large-scale applications.

Comparison of Hungarian matching and our method
Tab. 6 presents a comparison of the duration and GPU utilization when matching two point clouds
with the same number of points. It is evident that the Hungarian algorithm exhibits scalability issues.
For instance, when the point number is 10K, it consumes approximately 24 seconds and 2,304Mb of

GPU memory for a single matching. Scaling up to 100K points renders the matching infeasible due
to CUDA memory constraints, even on an 80G A100 GPU.

In contrast, our label assignment method achieves remarkable efficiency, requiring only about 1.25ms
and 28.85ms for 10K and 100K points, respectively. Furthermore, the GPU memory consumption
during training is negligible. These findings reveal the practicality and efficacy of our label assignment
approach, particularly for the occupancy prediction where point counts can easily exceed 10K.

Detailed configuration for different versions.
In this section, we detail the settings of various versions of our model, as shown in Tab. 7, each
tailored to prioritize different aspects of performance and speed. Our fastest model OPUS-T utilizes
only 0.6K queries, with each query sampling 4 points in images. The number of predicted points
are 1, 4, 16, 32, 64 and 128 for 6 stages, respectively. This configuration ensures a rapid processing
time while maintaining competitive performance. Other versions of our model, such as OPUS-S,
OPUS-M, OPUS-L, sample 2 points in CPS module, progressively double the number of queries and
adjust the number of predicted points accordingly to balance speed and accuracy. All these models
predict the same amount of points in the end.

Effects of various refined points number in last layer.
Tab. 8 assesses the impact of varying the number of predicted points in the last layer. We use OPUS-M
as our model for this experiment. As shown in the table, mIoU steadily rises as the number of points
increase from 8 to 64, going from 16.4 to 28.4. This trend is expected since increasing the number of
points generally leads to higher mIoU by covering more voxels, as mIoU penalizes false negative
(FN) heavily. However, the RayIoU results peak when model predicting 16 points and decline with
further increasing points. This decline occurs partly because adding more points beyond a certain
extent introduces noise, which negatively impacts RayIoU, which emphasizes first occupied voxels
along the ray.

D.4
Predictions across different distances
We report the RayIoU of FB-Occ and OPUS at different ranges in Tab. 9. It is evident that OPUS
demonstrates a more pronounced advantage in nearby areas than at far distances. This could be
attributed to the phenomenon pointed out by SparseOcc: dense approaches tend to overestimate the
surfaces, especially in nearby areas.

Additional qualitative analysis

E.1
Differences between SparseOcc and OPUS
View perspective of occupancy prediction. The fundamental difference lies in the perspective of
occupancy prediction. As depicted in the main draft, all previous methods, including SparseOcc [21],
treat occupancy prediction as a standard classification task. OPUS, however, pioneers a set prediction
viewpoint, offering a novel, elegant, and end-to-end sparsification approach.

Multi-stage vs. end-to-end sparsification procedure. SparseOcc generates sparse occupancy by
gradually discarding voxels through multiple stages. The discarding of empty voxels at early stages
is irreversible, leading to obvious cumulative errors, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Conversely, OPUS
circumvents complex filtering mechanisms by directly predicting a sparse set, resulting in more
coherent outcomes.

Detailed model design. In terms of a more detailed perspective of the structure, there are also many
differences such as:

• Query number. In NuScene-Occ3D, SparseOcc necessitates 32K queries in its final stage.
OPUS, by comparison, operates with a mere 0.6K-4.8K queries for occupancy prediction,
capitalizing on its flexible nature and contributing to its fast inference pace.

• Coarse-to-fine procedure. SparseOcc’s coarse-to-fine strategy involves progressively
filtering empty voxels and subdividing occupied voxels into finer ones. In contrast, OPUS
interprets coarse-to-fine as the escalation in number of predicted points across stages.

• Learning objective. Our learning target encompasses predicting both semantic classes
and occupied locations, simultaneously. The latter is a new objective introduced by OPUS,
achieved through a modified Chamfer distance loss.

E.2
Analysis of relationships between mIoU, RayIoU and driving safety.
Our OPUS-L (8f) has achieved a state-of-the-art RayIoU of 41.17, outperforming the previous sparse
model SparseOcc by 6.07 and the dense model FB-Occ by 7.7. The mIoU gap between sparse and
dense methods is also reduced from 8.5 in SparseOcc to 3.0 in OPUS. However, the implications
of this gap on safety remain ambiguous. This concern is particularly pertinent in the context of
autonomous driving, and we would like to clarify this as follows:

Risks of dense predictions. The biggest issue of dense predictions is the discrepancies between
evaluation metrics and real-world scenarios. As shown in Fig. 8, evaluation metrics only consider
voxels within the camera mask, which is derived from camera parameters and ground truth. However,
in real-world applications, we can only produce view mask based on camera intrinsics and extrinsics,
failing to filtering out over-estimated voxels. From Fig. 8 and and Fig. 3, dense methods can
misidentify occupied voxels, even close to the ego vehicle. These errors are overlooked during
evaluation but pose significant safety hazards in real-world scenarios. In contrast, OPUS suffer much
less from this issue as it does not over-estimate occupancy.

The depth errors of OPUS is much smaller than FB-Occ. In Fig. 9, we compare the depth errors
of FB-Occ and OPUS along camera rays. OPUS demonstrates lower depth errors across all scenes,
despite its relatively low mIoU performance. Given the significance of the first occupied voxel for
safety, OPUS’s precision in this regard enhances safety rather than detracting from it.

In conclusion, while it is necessary to minimize the mIoU gap between sparse and dense methods,
our analysis indicates that mIoU might not fully represent potentially hazardous situations. Therefore,
it would be more rational to take both mIoU and RayIoU into consideration for the occupancy task.

ground-truth occupancy. We can only generate the view mask from camera intrinsics and extrinsics,
which fails to filter out the over-estimated voxels from dense models. (c) Plenty of false positive
predictions are made close to the ego vehicle, marked by the symbol of red star. These erroneously
predicted voxels are filtered during evaluating mIoU, but could cause hazardous safety issue. (d)
The OPUS produces sparse occupancy predictions and suffers much less from the over-estimation.
Consequently, no such safety threat occurs in this scenario. Best viewed in color.

of scattered and discontinuous surfaces at long distances. Another is the presence of holes in predicted

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have described our contributions and scope explicitly in both the abstract
and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe our limitations in the section "Conclusions and Limitations" in
our main text.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best

19


---Page Break---
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided implementation details in our "Experiments" section. More-
over, our codes and configurations are directly attached in the supplementary for directly
reproducing our results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.

20


---Page Break---
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, we provide the codes and configurations in the supplementary. One can
easily reproduce our results after preparing the Occ3D dataset as required.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, our training/test details are detailedly presented in our "Experimental
Setup" section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

21


---Page Break---
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive
in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The computation resources are detailed in the "Experimental Setup" section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

---Page Break---
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our work adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the societal impacts of our work in the "Broader Impacts" section
in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The involved data/models does not pose a high risk for misuse.

Guidelines:

23


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We details licenses for existing assets in "Licenses for Involved Assets" section
in appendix and cites related papers in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The readme file in our code provides details about the training, license and
limitations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
