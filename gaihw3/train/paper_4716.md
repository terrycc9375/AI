Abstract

Leveraging the model’s outputs, specifically the logits, is a common approach to
estimating the test accuracy of a pre-trained neural network on out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples without requiring access to the corresponding ground-truth la-
bels. Despite their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, current
logit-based methods are vulnerable to overconfidence issues, leading to prediction
bias, especially under the natural shift. In this work, we first study the relation-
ship between logits and generalization performance from the view of low-density
separation assumption. Our findings motivate our proposed method MANO that
(1) applies a data-dependent normalization on the logits to reduce prediction bias,
and (2) takes the Lp norm of the matrix of normalized logits as the estimation
score. Our theoretical analysis highlights the connection between the provided
score and the model’s uncertainty. We conduct an extensive empirical study
on common unsupervised accuracy estimation benchmarks and demonstrate that
MANO achieves state-of-the-art performance across various architectures in the
presence of synthetic, natural, or subpopulation shifts. The code is available at

Introduction

The deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios is frequently challenged by
distribution shifts between the training and test data. These shifts can substantially deteriorate the
model’s performance during testing (Geirhos et al., 2018; Koh et al., 2021; Quionero-Candela et al.,
2009) and introduce significant risks related to AI safety (Deng and Zheng, 2021; Hendrycks and
Mazeika, 2022). To alleviate this issue, it is common to monitor model performance by periodically
collecting the ground truth labels for a subset of the current test dataset (Lu et al., 2023). However,

this approach is often resource-intensive and time-consuming, which motivates the importance of
estimating the model’s performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data in an unsupervised manner,
also known as Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation (Donmez et al., 2010).

Due to privacy constraints and computational efficiency, one of the most popular ways to estimate
accuracy without labels is to rely on the model’s outputs, called logits, as a source of confidence
in the model’s predictions (Deng et al., 2023; Garg et al., 2022; Guillory et al., 2021; Hendrycks
and Gimpel, 2016). For instance, ConfScore (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) leverages the average
maximum softmax probability as the test accuracy estimator, while Deng et al. (2023) has recently
proposed to estimate the accuracy via the nuclear norm of the softmax probability matrix. These
approaches, however, tend to underperform on the natural shift applications while the intuition behind
the use of logits remains unclear. This motivates us to ask:

Question 1: What explains the correlation between logits and generalization performance?

In Section 3, we show that logits are connected to the model’s margins, i.e., the distances between
the learned embeddings, and the decision boundaries. Inspired by the low-density separation (LDS)
assumption (Chapelle and Zien, 2005; Feofanov et al., 2023) that optimal decision boundaries should
lie in low-density regions, we propose MANO, an estimation score that aggregates the margins at
a dataset level by taking the Lp-norm of the normalized model’s prediction matrix to evaluate the
density around decision boundaries. Nevertheless, logit-based approaches are known to suffer from
overconfidence (Odonnat et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022a), resulting in high prediction bias, especially
under poorly-calibrated scenarios. This leads us to another critical question:

Question 2: How to alleviate the overconfidence issues of logits-based methods?

In Section 4, we reveal that this question is connected to the normalization of logits and show that the
widely-used softmax normalization accumulates errors in the presence of prediction bias, which can
lead to overconfidence and significantly degrade the performance of existing accuracy estimation
methods in poorly-calibrated scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel normalization
strategy called softrun that takes into account the empirical distribution of logits and aims to find a
trade-off between information completeness of ground-truth logits and error accumulation.

Summary of our contributions.
(1) We show that logits are informative of generalization per-
formance through the lens of the low-density separation assumption by reflecting the distances to
decision boundaries. (2) We identify the failure of the commonly-used softmax normalization that
accumulates errors under poorly calibrated because of its overconfidence, leading to biased estimation.
(3) We propose MANO, a training-free estimation method that quantifies the global distances to
decision boundaries by taking the Lp norm of the logits matrix. MANO relies on softrun, a novel
normalization technique that makes a trade-off between information completeness and error accumu-
lation and is robust to different calibration scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate its connection to
the model’s uncertainty. (4) We demonstrate the superiority of MANO compared to 11 competitors
with a large-scale empirical evaluation including 12 benchmarks across diverse distribution shifts.
Results show that MANO consistently improves over the state-of-the-art baselines, including on the
challenging natural shift.

Problem Statement

Setting.
Consider a classification task with input space X ⊂RD and label space Y = {1, . . . , K}.
Let pS and pT be the source and target distributions on X × Y, respectively, with pS ̸= pT . We
parameterize a neural network f : X →RK as f = fW ◦fφ, where fφ : X →Rq is a feature
extractor and fW : Rq →RK is a linear classifier with parameters W = (ωk)K
k=1 ∈Rq×K. Further,
we denote an input by x, its corresponding label by y, its representation by z = fφ(x) and logits by
q = f(x) = (ω⊤
k z)k ∈RK. The accuracy of f on D is defined as Acc(f, D) :=
1
|D|
P

(x,y)∈D 1ˆy=y
with predicted labels ˆy. The probability simplex is denoted by ∆K = {p ∈[0, 1]K|1⊤
Kp = 1}.

Unsupervised accuracy estimation.
Given a model f pre-trained on a training set Dtrain with
samples drawn i.i.d. from pS, the goal of unsupervised accuracy estimation is to assess its generaliza-
tion performance on a given unlabeled test set Dtest = {xi}N
i=1 with N samples drawn i.i.d. from
pT . More specifically, we assume (i) a source-free regime (no direct access to Dtrain), (ii) no access
to test labels, and (iii) a distribution shift, i.e. pS ̸= pT , . In this challenging setup, which often
occurs in real-world scenarios when ground-truth labels are inaccessible at a test time, we aim to
design an estimation score S(f, Dtest) that exhibits a linear correlation with the true OOD accuracy
Acc(f, Dtest). Following the standard closed-set setting, both pT and pS involve the same K classes.
For an extended discussion of related work on unsupervised accuracy estimation, we refer the reader
to Appendix B.

What Explains the Correlation between Logits and Test Accuracy?

Although existing literature has shown the feasibility of unsupervised accuracy prediction under
distribution shift by utilizing the model’s logits (Deng et al., 2023; Garg et al., 2022; Guillory et al.,
2021), the reason behind this empirical success remains unclear. In this section, we seek to understand
when and why logits can be informative for analyzing generalization performance. Based on the
derived understanding, we propose our approach, MANO, for estimating generalization performance.

3.1
Motivation

Logits reflect the distances to decision boundaries.
We analyze logits from a linear classification
perspective in the embedding space, where the decision boundary of class k is the hyperplane
{z′ ∈Rq|ω⊤
k z′ = 0}. In Appendix D.2, we remind that the distance from a point z to hyperplane ωk
is given by d(ωk, z) = |ω⊤
k z|/ ∥ωk∥. As the pre-trained model is fixed and ωk can be normalized, we
derive that the logits in absolute values are proportional to the distance from the learned embeddings
to the decision boundaries, i.e., |qk| = |ω⊤
k z| ∝d(ωk, z), ∀k. This indicates that the magnitude of
logits reflects how close the corresponding embedding is from each decision boundary.

Figure 1: Illustration of the LDS assumption. When the
boundary passes through dense regions (a), margins have
little predictive power and cannot be used without labels. On
the contrary, margins are informative in sparse regions (b).

Low-density separation assumption.
When dealing with unlabeled data,
it is required to make assumptions
on the relationship between the dis-
tance to decision boundaries and gen-
eralization performance.
The low-
density separation assumption (LDS,
Chapelle and Zien, 2005) states that
optimal decision boundaries should
lie in low-density regions (Figure 1)
so that unlabeled margin |ω⊤
k z| re-
flects reliable confidence in predict-
ing x to the class k. The assumption
is often empirically supported as the
misclassified samples tend to be sig-
nificantly closer to the decision bound-
ary than the correctly classified ones
(Mickisch et al., 2020). This might indicate that the absolute values of the logits are positively
correlated to its generalization performance.

Assumptions on the prediction bias.
It is important to note that the LDS assumption has been
initially proposed for semi-supervised learning where labeled and unlabeled data are assumed to
come from the same distribution, which is not the case in our setting. This leads to logits writing
f(x) = q∗+ ε in the general case⋄, i.e., subject to a potentially non-negligible prediction bias
ε = (εk)k with respect to the ground-truth logits q∗∈RK. The following proposition shows the
impact of the prediction bias on the divergence between the true class posterior probabilities, assumed
modeled as p = softmax(q∗) ∈∆K, and the estimated ones s = softmax(f(x)) ∈∆K.

⋄We write this decomposition without loss of generality as no restrictions are imposed on ε.

---Page Break---
Proposition 3.1. Let ε+ =(maxl{εl}−εk)k. Then, the KL divergence between p and s verifies

0 ≤KL(p||s) ≤εT
+p.

The proposition indicates that a large approximation error of the posterior may be caused by prediction
bias that has a large norm and / or bad alignment with the true probabilities. Thus, the logit-based
methods assume that the magnitude of the bias is reasonably bounded while the direction of bias
does not drastically harm the ranking of classes by probabilities. We elaborate on this discussion and
present the proof of Proposition 3.1 in Appendix D.1.

3.2
MANO: Predicting Generalization Performance With Matrix Norm of Logits

We have shown a connection between the feature-to-boundary distances and generalization perfor-
mance as well as the impact of the prediction bias. Based on the derived intuition, we introduce
MANO that leverages the model margins at the dataset level performing two steps: normalization and
aggregation. The pseudo-code of MANO is provided in Appendix A.

Step 1: Normalization.
Given that logits can exhibit significant variations in their scale depending
on the input x, it is crucial to normalize the logits within a standardized range to prevent outliers
from exerting disproportionate influence on the estimation. A natural range stems from the fact
that most deep classifiers have outputs in ∆K, which amounts to applying a normalization function
σ: RK →∆K on top of the pre-trained neural network (Mensch et al., 2019), where ∆K refers
to probability simplex. This ensures having logits entries in [0, 1]. For each test sample xi, we
first extract its learned feature representation zi = fφ(xi). Then, logits corresponding to this
representation are computed as qi = fW (zi) ∈RK. The normalization procedure results in a
prediction matrix Q ∈RN×K with each row Qi containing the normalized logits of an input sample:

Qi = σ(qi) ∈∆K,
(1)

where σ denotes the normalization function for the logits values. It is worth noting that not all
normalization methods are appropriate candidates. The selection of a suitable normalization function
σ based on different calibration scenarios will be discussed in detail in Section 4.

Step 2: Aggregation.
Once the logits are scaled, we aggregate the dataset-level information on
feature-to-boundary distances by taking the entry-wise Lp norm of the prediction matrix Q, which
can be expressed as:

S(f, Dtest) =
1

p√

NK
∥Q∥p =

 
1
NK

N
X

i=1

K
X

k=1
|σ(qi)k|p
! 1

p
,
(2)

As we have ||Q||p ≤
p√

NK max(Qij) =
p√

NK (Qij ∈[0, 1]), the scaling by
p√

NK leads to
S(f, Dtest) ∈[0, 1], providing a standardized metric regardless of variations in the size of the test
dataset N and the number of classes K. As p increases, MANO puts greater emphasis on high-margin
terms, focusing on confident classification hyperplanes. In the extreme case where p →∞, we have
|Q||p →max(Qij). In practice, we choose p = 4 in all experiments and provide an ablation study
on p in Appendix G.1. As the Lp norm is straightforward to compute, our approach is scalable and
efficient compared to the current state-of-the-art method Nuclear (Deng et al., 2023) that requires
performing a singular value decomposition.

3.3
Theoretical Analysis of MANO

In this section, we provide the theoretical support for the positive correlation between MANO and
test accuracy. More specifically, we reveal that our proposed score is connected with the uncertainty
of the neural network’s predictions in Theorem 3.3. Before presenting this result, we recall below the
definition of Tsallis α-entropies introduced in Tsallis (1988).

calibration scenarios is taking n ∈{2, 3}.

Definition 3.2 (Tsallis α-entropies (Tsallis, 1988)). Let α > 1 and k > 0. The Tsallis α-entropy
is defined as:
HT
α(p) = k(α −1)−1(1 −∥p∥α
α).

In this work, we choose k = 1

α following Blondel et al. (2019). The Tsallis entropies generalize
the Shannon entropy (limit case α →1) and have been used in various applications (Blondel et al.,
2019, 2020; Muzellec et al., 2017). More details can be found in Appendix C. The following theorem,
whose proof is deferred to Appendix D.3, states that the estimation score obtained with MANO is a
function of the average Tsallis entropy of the normalized neural network’s logits.

Theorem 3.3 (Connection to uncertainty). Let p > 1, a = p(p−1)

K
and b = 1

K . Given a test set
Dtest = {xi}N
i=1, corresponding logits qi = f(xi), a normalization function σ: RK →∆K
and p > 1, the estimation score S(f, Dtest) provided by MANO (Algorithm 1) verifies

(3)

As a > 0, Theorem 3.3 implies that the estimation score provided by MANO is negatively correlated
with the average Tsallis-entropy on the test set. In particular, the less certain the model is on test
data, the lower the test accuracy is and the higher the entropy term is in Eq. (3), resulting in a lower
score S(f, Dtest). As the converse sense holds, MANO provides a score positively correlated to the
test accuracy. This follows the findings of Guillory et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2021) and empirically
confirmed in Section 5 for various architectures, datasets, and types of shift.

How to Alleviate Overconfidence Issues of Logit-Based Methods?

The most common normalization technique of existing logit-based approaches is the softmax
normalization. In this section, we show that the widely used softmax is sensitive to prediction bias,
which hinders the quality of the estimation in poorly calibrated scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we
propose a novel normalization strategy, softrun, which balances the information completeness and
overconfidence accumulation based on calibration.

4.1
The Failure of Softmax Normalization Under Poorly-Calibrated Scenarios

It is widely known that the softmax normalization can suffer from overconfidence issues (Odonnat
et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022b) and saturation of its outputs (Chen et al., 2017), with one entry close
to one while the others are close to zero.

5


---Page Break---
Analysis.
To alleviate those issues, we first notice that the softmax can be decomposed as
softmax(q) = exp(q)/ PK
k=1 exp(qk) = (ϕ ◦exp)(q), where ϕ: RK
+ →∆K writes ϕ(u) =
u/ PK
k=1 uk = u/∥u∥1. While ϕ has appealing property for normalization (see Proposition D.2),
the exponential can accumulate prediction errors, leading to the softmax overconfidence and a biased
accuracy estimation. In particular, assume that the k-th entry of the output of the neural network on a
test sample xi writes q∗
i,k + εk, where q∗
i,k are the ground-truth logits and εk is the prediction error.
Then, the nth-order Taylor polynomial of the exponential writes

exp(q∗
i,k + εk) ≈1 + (q∗
i,k + εk) +
(q∗
i,k + εk)2

2!
+ ... +
(q∗
i,k + εk)n

n!
.
(4)

Consequently, logit-based accuracy estimation methods using softmax are sensitive to prediction
bias, leading to low-quality estimations in poorly calibrated scenarios.

Empirical evidence.
We illustrate this phenomenon in Figure 2(a) on two datasets, where a pre-
trained ResNet18 exhibits more pronounced calibration issues on PACS (Li et al., 2017) compared
to Office Home (Venkateswara et al., 2017). Figure 2(b) shows that using MANO with softmax
normalization is appropriate on Office-Home where the model is well calibrated but not in a mis-
calibrated scenario on PACS. Conversely, using MANO with 2nd-order Taylor approximation is
appropriate under miscalibration on PACS but not on Office-Home. In both cases, we see that
MANO can surpass the state-of-the-art method Nuclear (Deng et al., 2023) provided it uses the
appropriate normalization σ. Figure 2(c) illustrates the impact of truncating Eq. (4) up to the n-th
order. We conclude that a trade-off is needed between information completeness on true logits and
error accumulation depending on the type of calibration scenario. Specifically, when the model is
poorly calibrated on a given dataset (i.e., εk large in absolute value), the normalization should focus
on avoiding error accumulation, and when the model is well calibrated (i.e., εk small in absolute
value), the normalization should focus on information completeness.

4.2
Softrun: The Proposed Normalization Strategy

The above analysis shows that different calibration scenarios emphasize different information during
normalization. Therefore, we propose a normalization strategy called softrun that normalizes the
model outputs based on the calibration scenario. Given logits qi ∈RK and reusing the function ϕ
previously introduced, it takes the general form:

σ(qi) = (ϕ ◦v)(qi) =
v(qi)
PK
k=1 v(qi)k
∈∆K.
(5)

where v: RK →RK
+ is designed to avoid error accumulation under poorly-calibrated scenarios by
truncating the exponential (Taylor n = 2 in Eq. (4)) and using complete logits information under
well-calibrated scenarios (softmax). As in practice, the calibration of the model on test data is
unknown, softrun employs a simple yet effective strategy reminiscent of pseudo-labeling (Lee,
2013; Sohn et al., 2020). More specifically, given a test dataset Dtest = {xi}N
i=1 and corresponding
logits qi = f(xi), a criterion Φ(Dtest) is computed at the dataset level and the normalized logits are
defined as1

v(qi) =

(
1 + qi + q2
i
2 ,
if Φ(Dtest) ≤η
(Taylor)
exp(qi),
if Φ(Dtest) > η
(softmax) .
(6)

We define Φ(Dtest) = −
1
NK
PN
j=1
PK
k=1 log(
exp(qj)k
PK
j=1 exp(qi)j)), which is equal, up to a constant, to

the average KL divergence between the uniform distribution and the predicted softmax probabilities.
It follows from Tian et al. (2021) that showed that this KL divergence was small when the uncertainty
of the model was high and large for confident models. Hence, when the model is uncertain, i.e.,
Φ(Dtest) ≤η, we truncate the exponential to reduce error accumulation, and when the model is
certain, i.e., Φ(Dtest) > η, complete information is used with the exact exponential (and we recover
the softmax). Thus, softrun is designed to treat the problem with an additional level of complexity
often overlooked by previous methods. While this comes at the cost of introducing the hyperparameter
η, we fix η = 5 across all our experiments. This, along with the design of softrun, is justified both
theoretically in Appendix E and experimentally in Appendix G.3.

1In practice if Taylor is applied, we replace v(qi) by v(qi) −min v(qi) to make sure the final outputs have
nonnegative entries. This is especially needed for approximation orders n ≥3.

Experiments

In this section, we conduct experiments with MANO that uses softrun to properly normalize logits.

5.1
Experimental Setup

Pre-training datasets.
For pre-training the neural network, we use a diverse set of datasets includ-
ing CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009), TinyImageNet (Le and Yang, 2015),
ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), PACS (Li et al., 2017), Office-Home (Venkateswara et al., 2017),
DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019) and RR1-WILDS (Taylor et al., 2019), and BREEDS (Santurkar et al.,
2020) which leverages class hierarchy of ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) to create 4 datasets including
Living-17, Nonliving-26, Entity-13 and Entity-30.

Test datasets.
In our comprehensive evaluation, we consider 12 datasets with 3 types of distribution
shifts: the synthetic, the natural, and the subpopulation shifts. To verify the effectiveness of our
method under the synthetic shift, we use CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C (Hendrycks and
Dietterich, 2019) that span 19 types of corruption across 5 severity levels, as well as TinyImageNet-C
(Hendrycks and Dietterich, 2019) with 15 types of corruption and 5 severity levels. For the natural
shift, we use the domains excluded from training from PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, and RR1-
WILDS as the OOD datasets. For the novel subpopulation shift, we consider the BREEDS benchmark
with Living-17, Nonliving-26, Entity-13, and Entity-30 which were constructed from ImageNet-C.

Training details.
To show the versatility of our method across different architectures, we perform
experiments with ResNet18, ResNet50 (He et al., 2016), and WRN-50-2 (Zagoruyko and Komodakis,
2016) models. We train them for 20 epochs for CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009) and 50
epochs for the other datasets. In all cases, we use SGD with a learning rate of 10−3, cosine learning
rate decay (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016), a momentum of 0.9, and a batch size of 128.

Evaluation metrics.
We use the coefficient of determination R2 ∈[0, 1] (Nagelkerke et al., 1991)
and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ρ ∈[−1, 1] (Kendall, 1948) to evaluate performance.
The former measures the linearity and goodness of fit and 1 indicates a perfect fit. ρ measures
monotonicity and values close to {−1, 1} indicate strong correlation while 0 indicates no correlation.

Baselines.
We consider 11 baselines commonly evaluated in the unsupervised accuracy estimation
studies, including Rotation Prediction (Rotation) (Deng et al., 2021), Averaged Confidence (ConfS-
core) (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016), Entropy (Guillory et al., 2021), Agreement Score (AgreeScore)
(Jiang et al., 2021), Averaged Threshold Confidence (ATC) (Garg et al., 2022), AutoEval (Fr´echet)
(Deng and Zheng, 2021), ProjNorm (Yu et al., 2022), Dispersion Score (Dispersion) (Xie et al., 2023),
MDE (Peng et al., 2024), COT (Lu et al., 2024), and Nuclear Norm (Nuclear) (Deng et al., 2023).

Main Takeaways

MANO improves over state-of-the-art.
Tables 1 and 2 present the numerical results of unsuper-
vised accuracy estimation across 8 datasets using 3 different network architectures, evaluated under
synthetic and subpopulation shifts. These shifts are quantified by R2 and ρ. Empirical results demon-
strate that these distribution shifts do not significantly impact calibration (i.e., Φ(Dtest) > η). We
observe that MANO consistently outperforms other baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
For instance, MANO achieves R2 > 0.960 and ρ > 0.990 under subpopulation shift, whereas the
performance of other baselines does not reach such consistently high levels.

MANO significantly boosts performance under the natural shift.
Table 3 illustrates the results
of accuracy estimation under the natural shift on four datasets. Under the challenging and natural
shift that is more complex than the other distribution shifts, we empirically observe Φ(Dtest) ≤η.
From Table 3, we observe a significant improvement compared with the other baselines. In particular,
most methods have an R2 and a ρ under 0.9 while MANO reaches higher values. In addition, our
method achieves the best performance on average on all four datasets. To visualize the estimation
performance, we provide the scatter plots for Dispersion Score, ProjNorm and MANO in Figure 3
on Entity-18 with ResNet18. We find that MANO scores present a robust linear relationship with
ground-truth OOD errors, while the other state-of-the-art baselines tend to exhibit a biased estimation
of high test errors.

Figure 3: OOD error prediction versus ground-truth error on Entity-13 with ResNet18. This scatter
plot compares MANO with Dispersion Score and ProjNorm. Each point represents one dataset under
a specific type and severity of corruption. Different shapes indicate different types of corruption,
while darker colors indicate higher severity levels. This indicates the qualitative superiority of MANO.

Improved robustness.
Figure 4 presents a box plot showing the estimation robustness across
different distribution shifts on all datasets except ImageNet, using ResNet18. Results for ImageNet
are excluded due to the lack of Rotation and AgreeScore data for this dataset, as these two methods
require retraining the networks. We observe that the estimation performance of MANO is more
stable than other baselines across three types of distribution shifts. Additionally, MANO achieves the
highest median estimation performance.

Additional Experiments

In this section, we discuss the results obtained with additional architectures, the ablation studies we
conducted to validate our implementation choices, and the generalization capabilities of MANO.

Beyond ResNets.
To demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of MANO, we conduct experiments
on recent models such as Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy, 2020, ViT) and ConvNeXt (Liu et al.,
2022). We compare MANO to its best competitors on 6 datasets for 3 distribution shifts in Figure 5.
The full results are gathered in Table 5 of Appendix F. We note that ConfScore is particularly strong
with ConvNexts while MANO works the best with ResNets and ViT. Again, we observe that MANO
is the best method overall.

Ablation study.
To motivate our choices of implementation, we provide in Appendix G ablation
studies on the Lp norm and the Taylor order n as well as a sensitive analysis on the calibration
threshold η.

Generalization capabilities of MANO.
To verify the generalization capabilities of MANO, we
utilize designed scores calculated from ImageNet-C and their corresponding accuracy to fit a linear
regression model. This model is then used to predict the test accuracy on ImageNet-V2- ¯C, which is
generated using the 10 new corruptions provided by (Mintun et al., 2021) on ImageNet-V2 (Recht
et al., 2019). These new corruptions are perceptually dissimilar from those in ImageNet-C, including
warps, blurs, color distortions, noise additions, and obscuring effects. Figure 6 shows that ConfScore
and Dispersion give two distinct trends, while Nuclear exhibits some deviations for ImageNet-V2-
¯C. In comparison, our MANO exhibits a consistent prediction pattern for both ImageNet-C and
ImageNet-V2- ¯C, aligning well with the linear regression model trained on ImageNet-C. Additionally,

Discussion

In this section, we discuss how MANO can be applied in practice, the benefit of combining softrun
with other estimation baselines, and the limitations of our approach.

Real-world applications.
In Appendix H, we discuss how MANO can be used in real-world
applications. In particular, our additional results with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric confirm
the superiority of MANO.

Can softrun enhance other logit-based
methods?
To study this, we conducted
an ablation study by equipping softrun
with Nuclear (Deng et al., 2023), ConfS-
core (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016), and our
MANO. In Table 4, we observe that softrun
significantly enhances the estimation perfor-
mance R2 of Nuclear. For example, Nuclear
is improved from 0.692 to 0.826 on poorly-
calibrated Office-Home.

Limitations.
Despite its soundness and strong empirical performance, we acknowledge that our
method has potential areas for improvement. One of these is the dependence on η of the selection
criterion in Eq. (6). We elaborate on this discussion in Appendix E.3. In future work, we will
explore a smoother way to automatically select the optimal normalization function without requiring
hyperparameters. Additionally, if multiple validation sets are provided, as in (Deng et al., 2021; Deng
and Zheng, 2021), we could select η based on those sets.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce MANO, a simple yet effective training-free method to estimate test
accuracy in an unsupervised manner using the Matrix Norm of neural network predictions on test
data. Our approach is inspired by the LDS assumption that optimal decision boundaries should lie in
low-density regions. To mitigate the negative impact of different distribution shifts on estimation
performance, we first demonstrate the failure of softmax normalization under poor calibration, due
to the accumulation of overconfident errors. We then propose a normalization strategy based on
Taylor polynomial approximation, balancing logits information and error accumulation. Extensive
experiments show that MANO consistently outperforms previous methods across various distribution
shifts. This work highlights that logits imply the feature-to-boundary distance and considers the
impact of calibration on estimation performance. We hope our insights inspire future research to
explore the relationship between model outputs and generalization.

Extended Related Work

Unsupervised accuracy estimation.
This task aims to estimate model generalization per-
formance on unlabeled test sets.
To achieve this, several directions have been proposed.
(1) Utilizing model outputs: One popular research direction is to use the model outputs on distribution-
shifted data to construct a linear relationship with the test accuracy (Deng et al., 2023; Garg et al.,
2022; Guillory et al., 2021; Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016; Xie et al., 2024). Some of these approaches
are limited by requiring access to the training set (Chen et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2020). The
most recent work (Deng et al., 2023) uses the nuclear norm of the softmax probability matrix as
a training-free accuracy estimator. However, it significantly suffers from the overconfidence is-
sues (Wei et al., 2022a), leading to fluctuating estimation performance across natural distribution
shifts. Our work focuses on addressing this issue by balancing logit-information completeness
and overconfidence-information accumulation. (2) Considering distribution discrepancy: another
direction examines the negative relation between test accuracy and the distribution discrepancy
between the training and test datasets (Deng and Zheng, 2021; Lu et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023;
Yu et al., 2022). However, commonly-used distribution distances do not guarantee stable accuracy
estimation under different distribution shifts (Guillory et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023), and some of these
methods are time-consuming on large-scale datasets due to the requirement of training data (Deng
and Zheng, 2021). (3) Constructing unsupervised losses: methods such as data augmentation and
multiple-classifier agreement have also been introduced (Jiang et al., 2021; Madani et al., 2004;
Platanios et al., 2017, 2016). However, they usually require special model architectures, undermining
their practical applicability.

Distance to decision boundaries.
The idea of treating distance to the decision boundary as an
indicator of confidence originates from classical support vector machines (Vapnik, 1998). Decision
boundaries of deep neural networks have been studied in various contexts. For example, some works
explore the geometric properties of deep neural networks either in the input space (Fawzi et al., 2018;
Karimi et al., 2019; Montufar et al., 2014; Poole et al., 2016) or in the weight space (Chaudhari
et al., 2019; Choromanska et al., 2015; Dauphin et al., 2014; Dinh et al., 2017; Freeman and Bruna,
2016). Some works apply the properties of decision boundaries to address practical questions, such
as adversarial defense (Croce and Hein, 2020; He et al., 2018; Heo et al., 2019), OOD detection
(Lee et al., 2020), and domain generalization (Li et al., 2022; Yousefzadeh, 2021). As we discuss
in Section 3.1, those approaches that use the distance to the decision boundary as an unsupervised
indicator of confidence, rely on the low-density separation assumption (Chapelle and Zien, 2005),
which states that the classifier must mistake mostly in the low margin zone (Feofanov et al., 2019,
2024). In our work, under this assumption, similar to Li et al. (2018), we use the distance between
the learned intermediate feature to each decision boundary in the last hidden space.

Normalization in deep learning.
Normalization is a crucial technique extensively utilized across
various fields in deep learning, including domain generalization (Fan et al., 2021; Seo et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2021), metric learning (Oord et al., 2018; Sohn, 2016; Wu et al., 2018), face recognition
(Deng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Ranjan et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019) and
self-supervised learning (Chen et al., 2020). For example, TENT (Wang et al., 2021) normalizes
features of test data using the mean value and standard deviation estimated from the target data.
L2-constrained softmax (Ranjan et al., 2017) introduces L2 normalization on features. These
normalization techniques are primarily employed to adapt new samples to familiar domains, calculate
similarity, and speed up convergence. However, our proposed normalization focuses on reducing the
negative implications of poorly calibrated scenarios.

Background on Tsallis Entropies

The definition of Tsallis α-entropies (Tsallis, 1988) is given below.

Definition C.1 (Tsallis α-entropies). Let p ∈∆K be a probability distribution. Let α > 1 and
k ≥0. The Tsallis α-entropy is defined as:

HT
α(p) = k(α −1)−1(1 −∥p∥α
α).

Figure 7: Tsallis α-entropies
of [t, 1 −t] for t ∈[0, 1].

It is common to take k = 1 or k = 1

α following Blondel et al. (2019).
The Tsallis α-entropy generalizes the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory of
statistic mechanics to nonextensive systems. It has been used as
a measure of disorder and uncertainty in many applications (Gell-
Mann and Tsallis, 2004; Negrinho and Martins, 2014; Sneddon,
2007; Teimoori et al., 2024), including in Machine Learning (Blon-
del et al., 2019, 2020; Muzellec et al., 2017). Moreover, they general-
ize two widely-known measures of uncertainty. Indeed, the limit case
α →1 leads to the Shannon entropy HS (see Peters et al., 2019, Ap-
pendix A.1), i.e., limα→1 HT
α(p) = HS(p) = −PK
j=1 pj ln(pj),
while taking α = 2 leads to the Gini index G, a popular impurity
measure fo decision trees (Gini, 1912), i.e., HT
2 (p) = 1

2(1−∥p∥2
2) =
G(p). Tsallis entropies measure the uncertainty: the higher the entropy the greater the uncertainty.
From a probabilistic perspective, the entropy will take high values for uncertain probability distri-
butions, i.e., close to the uniform distribution. We visualize the evolution of the Tsallis entropy for
varying parameters α in Figure 7, where the case α = 1 corresponds to the Shannon entropy.

Impact of Prediction Errors

Let x ∈Dtest be a test sample with ground-truth label y ∈{1, . . . , K}. In multi-class classification,
the softmax operator is used to approximate the posterior probability p(y|x) (see Bishop, 2006,
chap.4, p.198). Reusing the notations of Section 4, because of the distribution shifts between source
and target, logits are subject to a prediction bias ε = (εk)k and write f(x) = q∗+ ε where q∗are
ground-truth logits. In this section, we study the impact of such bias on the approximation of the
posterior p(y|x).

19


---Page Break---
Impact on the posterior approximation.
Proposition 3.1 shows the impact of the prediction
bias on the KL divergence between the true class posterior probabilities, assumed modeled as
p = softmax(q∗) ∈∆K, and the estimated ones s = softmax(f(x)) ∈∆K. In particular, it states
that
0 ≤KL(p||s) ≤εT
+p,
(7)
where ε+ = (maxl{εl} −εk)k ∈RK
+ . The proof is given below.

Proof. We denote q = f(x) ∈RK the neural network’s outputs on a given test sample x. We first
remark that

To obtain the upper-bound, we notice that
exp(q∗
j + εj) = exp(q∗
j) exp(εj) ≤exp(q∗
j) · max
l
{exp(εl)}.

This leads toPK

Using the fact that all the terms are positive and that ln and exp are increasing functions, we obtain
from Eq. (8) that

= εT
+p.

(10)

Combining Eq. (8) and Eq. (10) gives the upper bound.

The quantities ε+ is a linear transformation of the prediction bias ε ∈RK and has nonnegative entries,
which means each class is overestimated, representing an overconfident model. Proposition 3.1 shows
that the discrepancy between the error approximation of the posterior probabilities is controlled by the
alignment between the posterior and this extreme prediction bias. In addition, by a simple application
of Cauchy-Schwartz in Eq. (7) and using the fact that |p∥= P

k=1 p2
k ≤P

k=1 pk = 1, we have
KL(p||s) ≤∥ε+∥2. In particular, in the perfect situation where ε = 0, ε+ is equal to 0 and the
softmax probabilities perfectly approximate the posterior. In summary, Proposition 3.1 indicates that
not only the norm of the prediction bias but also its alignment to the posterior is responsible for the
approximation error of the posterior. In our setting, it means that logits-methods need a low prediction
bias on classes on which the model is confident such that softmax probabilities can be reliably used
to estimate accuracy. This follows our analysis and empirical verification from Section 4.

A real-world example.
Although we usually tend to think that a high prediction bias shifts the
predicted posterior towards the uniform distribution, in the general case, other situations may happen
that hinder the quality of the accuracy estimation. For example, one may think of a letter recognition
task with a neural network pre-trained on the Latin alphabet and tested on the Cyrillic one. In this
case, some prediction probabilities will be adversarial as the neural network will not be aware of the
semantic differences between the Latin “B” and the Cyrillic “B”, therefore predicting a wrong class
with high probability.

Distance to the Hyperplane

Lemma D.1 (Dohmatob (2020)). Let ω ∈Rn be non zero and b ∈R. The distance between
any point z ∈Rn and the hyperplane {x|ω⊤x + b = 0} writes d(ω, z) = |ω⊤x + b|/ ∥ω∥.

Proof. The proof follows the geometric intuition from Dohmatob (2020). We recall it here for the
sake of self-consistency. The distance between z and the hyperplane H = {x ∈Rn|ω⊤x + b = 0}
is equal to the distance between z and its orthogonal projection on H. We consider the line L =
{z + tω|t ∈R} that is orthogonal to H and passes through z. The desired orthogonal projection is
simply the point z + t∗ω such that L and H intersects, i.e., such that

ω⊤(z + t∗ω) + b = 0 ⇔ω⊤z + b = −t∗∥ω∥2

⇔t∗= −ω⊤z + b

∥ω∥2
.
(∥ω∦= 0)

It follows that the distance between z and H writes

d(ω, z) = ∥z −z + t∗ω∥=

−ω⊤z + b

∥ω∥2
× ω

Properties of ϕ

The softmax can be decomposed as softmax(q) = exp(q)/ PK
k=1 exp(q)k = (ϕ ◦exp)(q), where
ϕ: RK
+ →∆K writes ϕ(u) = u/ PK
k=1 uk = u/∥u∥1. We extend the domain of ϕ to RK
+ by setting
ϕ(0) = 1

K 1K. The following proposition states the properties of ϕ.

Proposition D.2 (Properties of ϕ).

1. Generalized injectivity. ∀u, v ∈RK
+ \ {0},
ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) ⇐⇒∃α ∈R∗, s.t. u = αv

21


---Page Break---
2. Evaluation on constant inputs. Let u = α1K with α ≥0. Then, we have ϕ(u) = 1

K 1K.

Proof. We start by proving the first part of Proposition D.2. Let u, v ∈RK
+ \ 0. We have

ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) ⇐⇒
u
∥u∥1
=
v
∥v∥1
⇐⇒u = ∥u∥1

∥v∥1
| {z }
α>0

×v.

Then, we prove the second part of the proposition. Let α ≥0 and consider u = α1K ∈RK
+ . If
α = 0, then u = 0 and by definition, ϕ(u) = ϕ(0) = 1

K 1K. Assuming α > 0, we have

ϕ(u) =
u
∥u∥1
=
u
PK
k=1 uk
=
α
PK
k=1 α
× 1K = 1

K 1K.

The first part of the proposition is dubbed “generalized injectivity” as the injectivity can be retrieved
by fixing α = 1 in Proposition D.2. It ensures that ϕ only has equal outputs if the inputs are similar.
To illustrate that, consider the logits q, δ ∈RK. From Proposition D.2, having softmax(q) =
softmax(δ) is equivalent to having exp(q) = α exp(δ) for some α ̸= 0. By positivity of both sides,
it implies α > 0, and taking the logarithm leads to q = δ + ln α. It means that q equals δ up to
a fixed constant. From a learning perspective, those logits will thus have the same predicted label
and normalized logits. Proposition D.2 shows that using ϕ preserves the information from the neural
network. In addition, if the neural network’s output is not informative,i.e., all entries are equal, then
the link function gives equal probability to all classes.

Theoretical Insights into Criterion Φ(Dtest)

the prediction bias proposing a new alternative normalization, softrun, that we recall is

In this section, we first would like to give more insights on the choice of Φ(Dtest) and the selection
rule. Then, we motivate our choice of the hyperparameter η. Finally, we discuss the potential
limitations of our approach.

E.1
Choice of Criterion Φ(Dtest)

Intuition.
We first provide some high-level intuition behind the selection criterion of Section 4. As
we discussed before, the main idea of the logit-based approach is to rely on the model’s confidence
whose reliability depends on the prediction bias induced by possible distribution shift. Depending on
exact values of confidence and bias, we can roughly distinguish the five following cases illustrated in
Figure 8 and described as follows:

1. High confidence, high bias. The model is self-confident but practically makes a lot of mistakes.
This corresponds to the case when assumptions are not met (Section 3.1), so logits are generally
uninformative, and no normalization technique can really fix it. Thus, in practice, we have to
make sure that the low-density separation (LDS) assumption holds, which is generally the case
for well-calibrated models trained on diverse training sets. However, a user has to be careful
when applying test-time adaptation methods (Chen et al., 2022; Rusak et al., 2022; Wang et al.,
2021) to an original pre-trained model, since these approaches perform unsupervised confidence
maximization making LDS not guaranteed anymore.

Figure 8: A schematic illustration of possible cases that may or may not happen and what normaliza-
tion technique we use depending on the model’s confidence and the value of the prediction bias. The
two unadmissible scenarios correspond to the red sub-squares.

2. Low confidence, low bias. The model tends to output confidence that is low but overall precise.
This situation is unlikely to happen mainly for the following two reasons. Firstly, the classification
problem is poorly posed as the considered case implies that the true posterior probabilities are
close to uniform ones. Secondly, it is known that deep neural networks tend to be overconfident in
their predictions (Wei et al., 2022a), which we also observed in our experiments. Thus, we do not
consider this case and leave it as a subject of future work.
3. High confidence, low bias. The model tends to be self-confident being overall precise. This is
a favorable case as logits are very reliable, so we can use softmax normalization without being
afraid to be too optimistic.
4. Low confidence, high bias. The model is not confident in their predictions and it indeed makes a
lot of mistakes due to the high prediction bias. This is also a favorable scenario as low confidence
correlates with low performance. In this case, we want posterior probabilities to be close to
uniform, and we use the Taylor normalization due to its smoother behavior.
5. Grey zone. It corresponds to a mixed scenario when different examples may refer to different cases.
As it is generally difficult to know what normalization technique would be the most relevant, we
would opt for a more conservative solution in this situation. This is where the Taylor normalizer
becomes useful as it does not exacerbate prediction bias to the same degree as the softmax (see
Section 4.1 for more details).

Formulation of Φ(Dtest).
As we discussed in the main body of the paper, the criterion Φ(Dtest)
is equal, up to a constant, to the average KL divergence between the uniform distribution and the
predicted softmax probabilities (Tian et al., 2021). This implies that the criterion reflects the model’s
confidence being high when predicted probabilities are far away from the uniform ones. As we rely
on the LDS assumption, high values of Φ(Dtest) correspond to the 3rd case (high confidence, low
bias), and the softmax normalization is selected. Conversely, when the Φ(Dtest) is lower than the
threshold η, we apply Taylor, which corresponds to either the 4th case (low confidence, high bias) or
the 5th case (grey zone).

Connection between criterion and misclassification error.
The next proposition provides further
insights into our selection process. Let u = 1

K 1K ∈∆K be the uniform probability. The test dataset
writes Dtest = {xi}N
i=1 with corresponding logits qi = f(xi) and ground-truth labels Ytest =

23


---Page Break---
{yi}N
i=1 (unavailable in practice). We denote the softmax probabilities by si = softmax(qi) =
exp(qi)/ PK
k=1 exp(qi)k ∈∆K. We introduce the entropy of a probability vector as H(p) =
−1

K
PK
k=1 pk ln(pk). In particular, it is a measure of uncertainty and takes a high value when the
model is uncertain, i.e., outputs probabilities close to the uniform. We establish in the following
proposition the connection between the criterion Φ(Dtest), the miscalibration error, the model’s
confidence, and its entropy.

Proposition E.1 (Φ(Dtest), misclassification error, confidence and entropy). We have

Proof. We first present the following lemma that introduces the change of measure inequality
(Banerjee, 2006; Seldin and Tishby, 2010).

Lemma E.2 (Change of measure inequality (Seldin and Tishby, 2010)). Let Z be a random
variable on {1, . . . , K} and µ = (µk)k ∈∆K and ν = (νk)k ∈∆K be two probability
distributions. For any measurable function ψ: Z →R, the following inequality holds:

which concludes the proof by using the notations introduced in Proposition E.1.

Interpretation.
The term ξ(Dtest, Ytest), dubbed misclassification error, is the average error on the
test set between the optimal probability on the true label (i.e., 1) and the predicted probability si
y. It
takes high values when the model makes a lot of mistakes, assigning low confidence to the true class
labels, and low values otherwise. U(Dtest) is the average KL divergence on the test set between the
predicted probabilities and the uniform distribution and it measures the model’s confidence (Tian et al.,
2021). It takes high values when the predicted probabilities are far from the uniform (confidence)
and low values when they are close to the uniform (uncertain). H(Dtest) is the average entropy
on the test set of the predicted probabilities. It takes high values when predicted probabilities are
close to the uniform and low values otherwise. Proposition E.1 implies that when the model makes
few mistakes (ξ(Dtest, Ytest) is low) and is confident (U(Dtest) is high and H(Dtest) is low), then
the criterion Φ(Dtest) takes high values. This matches the empirical evidence from from Tian et al.
(2021). Proposition E.1 is harder to analyze in other scenarios, i.e, when the misclassification
error, the confidence, or the entropy behaves differently, mostly because of the interplay between
U(Dtest) and H(Dtest). However, we experimentally show the benefits of Φ(Dtest) and softrun
in Section 5 where MANO achieves superior performance against 11 commonly used baselines for
various architectures and types of shifts on 12 datasets.

E.2
Choice of hyperparameter η

In all our experiments, we take η = 5 for the selection criterion in Eq. (6). We motivate this choice in
what follows. In our setting, we consider test samples xi ∈Dtest drawn i.i.d. from the test distribution
pT . As the model f pre-trained on Dtrain is a deterministic function, the logits qi are i.i.d. random
variables and the decision threshold Φ(Dtest) = −

P(|Φ(Dtest) −µ| > νη) ≤1

η2 .
(11)

25


---Page Break---
The threshold Φ(Dtest) is used to determine how calibrated the model is on a given test dataset
Dtest. Figure 2(b) shows that our proposed normalization is optimal in poorly calibrated datasets and
performs slightly below the softmax in calibrated situations. Hence, we can afford to be conservative
and we want to consider the model calibrated only for extreme values of Φ(Dtest). From Eq. (11),
taking η = 5 ensures that the probability that Φ(Dtest) deviates from its mean by several standard
deviations with probability smaller than 5% ( 1

25 < 0.05). It should be noted that we do not claim
the optimality of this choice nor the optimality of our automatic selection in Eq. (6). However, it is
particularly difficult to define decision rules in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings (Amini
et al., 2022). Moreover, using Eq. (6), MANO remains suitable even when test labels are not available
which is often the case in real-world applications, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
for various architecture and types of shifts in Section 5. For the sake of self-consistency, we also
provide a sensitivity analysis on the values of η in Appendix G.3.

E.3
Potential Limitations

It should be noted that the selection criterion of Eq. (6) remains somehow heuristic and might depend
on the model, the data, or the threshold η. As stated above, the chosen value of η is motivated by a
probabilistic argument and by our experiments. However, as it can be seen in Eq. (11), the mean and
standard deviation of Φ(Dtest) can impact the validity of η. In particular, this could be the case when
applying MANO on other data modalities than images or in other learning settings (e.g., classification
with a huge number of classes, regression tasks, auto-regressive settings). We believe this is the
subject of future work to improve the robustness and versatility of our method.

Impact of the number of classes.
As a first research direction, we provide a motivating example
with synthetic data on the impact of the number of classes K on the values of Φ(Dtest). We uniformly
draw random vectors of RK in [−5, 5] to mimic the logits obtained from 100000 independent models.

Figure 9: Evolution of the 99% confidence interval
on Φ(Dtest) with the number of classes K. As
K increases, Φ(Dtest) will likely be higher than
η = 5.

We compute the corresponding Φ(Dtest) for
each model and recover the 0.5th and 99.5th
percentile to obtain a 99% confidence interval.
We repeat this experiment for K ∈J2, 100K.
The evolution of the confidence interval is dis-
played in Figure 9. We observe that as soon as
K > 3, the upper bound of the confidence inter-
val has a very slow increase. However, the lower
bound increases quickly in the beginning until
K ∼25 and then adopts the same increase pace
as the upper bound. In summary, the range of
values of Φ(Dtest) becomes thinner and more
concentrated on high values for K > 25. In
particular, we observe that 99% of the models
have an associated Φ(Dtest), higher than η = 5,
which means that in this situation, the softmax
would always be selected as a normalization σ.
While the conclusions from this experiment are
not directly applicable to our real experimental
setting (in particular, Taylor and softmax cases
of Eq. (6) occur both for datasets with K > 25 and K ≤25), we believe it motivates further work to
make η more robust to the values of Φ(Dtest). In particular, one could propose to compute η based
on statistics of the data or as a function of the number of classes.

Dispersion of the softmax.
In the previous paragraph, we showed that the number of classes K
can have an impact on the values taken by criterion Φ(Dtest). As the criterion relies on the softmax
probabilities of the model on test data, it is natural to investigate the impact of K on the softmax
function. The lemma below shows that the softmax must disperse on all entries as the number of
classes K increases. It means that the total weights on the softmax entries (equal to 1) cannot be
concentrated on a few entries as the number of classes K increases.

Lemma E.3. Let θ ∈RK be logits of a neural network f such that ∥θ∥1 ≤c for some c > 0.
Then, as the number of classes grows, i.e., K →∞, we have

softmax(θ) = O
 1

K

where the equality holds at the component level.

Proof. Following the proof of Zekri et al. (2024, Lemma D.7), we can show for all i ∈[K] that

exp (−c)

j=1 exp (c)

j=1 exp (θj) ≤

⇐⇒

K ≤softmax(θ)i ≤b

K ,

where a = exp (−2c), b = exp (2c) are constant. This concludes the proof.

Lemma E.3 implies that, as the number of classes grows, the highest value an individual entry can
have decreases. Hence, the number of classes impacts the distribution of the weights among the
softmax entries (recalling that it must sum at 1 as it is a probability vector). As by definition,
Φ(Dtest) depends on the softmax probability distributions, this will impact its value. We believe
that empirically and theoretically studying this phenomenon could be insightful in deriving more
robust selection criteria and threshold values. We note that Lemma E.3 is similar but more general
than Veliˇckovi´c et al. (2024, Lemma 2.1) as our global bounding condition on θ encompasses their
entry-wise condition.

Beyond ResNets: Experiments with Vision Transformers and ConvNeXts

To evaluate the efficiency of MANO across diverse model architectures, we conducted additional
experiments with the Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy, 2020, ViT) and the ConvNeXt (Liu et al.,
2022) architectures. The numerical results are gathered in Table 5. Two methods stand out from the
rest of the baselines: ConfScore and MANO. In particular, ConfScore is particularly strong with the
ConvNeXt architecture while MANO is better with the Vision Transformer. Overall, MANO leads to
a better accuracy estimation on average.

Table 5: Method comparison using Vision Transformer (ViT) and ConvNext under synthetic, sub-
population and natural shifts with R2 and ρ metrics (the higher the better). The best results for
each metric are in bold. Overall, MANO surpasses its competitors while ConfScore appears to be
stronger with ViT and ConvNext than with ResNets.

Sensitivity Analysis and Ablation Study

G.1
Choice of Lp Norm

To reflect the impact of different Lp norms on estimation performance, we conduct a sensitivity
study on 5 datasets with ResNet18, whose results are shown in Figure 10(a). The performance for
p = 1 is ignored as in this case, ∥Q∥1 = 1 because Q is right-stochastic. We can see that when we
choose p ∈[2, 5], the results fluctuate within a satisfying range. This can be explained by the fact that
within this range, we emphasize adequately the large positive feature-to-boundary distances without
ignoring the other comparatively small distances.

G.2
Choice of Taylor Approximation Order

In Figure 10(b), we verify the impact of Taylor formula approximation on final accuracy estimation
performance. It should be noted that for orders higher than in the default setting in Eq. (6), the
positivity is lost. To alleviate this issue, we consistently remove for all orders the minimum value of
the obtained vector to each of its entries to ensure having an output in RK
+ . This extends de Br´ebisson
and Vincent (2016) to orders higher than 2. From this figure, we can see that when we reserve the first
three terms in the Taylor formula, the average estimation performance is optimal. For well-calibrated
datasets such as Office-Home and WILDS, there exists an increased trend of estimation performance
when we reserve more Taylor formula terms. As for suboptimal-calibrated datasets such as PACS
and Office-31, their performance rises when fewer terms are reserved. It empirically certifies that the
normalization technique is a trade-off tool between the ground-truth logits’ information and error
accumulation. In addition, the optimal choice is to keep 3 terms in Eq. (4) which motivates our
default setting in Eq (6).

G.3
Choice of Calibration Threshold η

In Table 6, we display the performance comparison for varying values of threshold η on three datasets
with ResNet18. It should be noted that taking η = 0 corresponds to the case where the softmax
is always taken, i.e., the common choice in the literature. This matches our theoretical insights in
Appendix E.2 and confirms that taking η = 5 is a robust and effective choice for softrun.

G.4
Superiority of softrun

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed normalization technique, softrun, we conduct an ablation
study by replacing our normalization with the softmax function under the natural shift. In Figure 10(c),
we observe that our proposed normalization significantly enhances the estimation performance of
datasets from the natural shift. Especially, R2 for poorly-calibrated datasets such as PACS is improved
from 0.541 to 0.812.

results motivate our choice of η = 5.

Generalization Capabilities of MANO on ImageNet- ¯C

To further demonstrate the generalization capability of MANO, we provide a similar experiment with
that in Section 5.4 on ImageNet-C and ImageNet- ¯C (Mintun et al., 2021) in Figure 11. In particular,
we fit a linear regression function on ImageNet-C and use the linear function to predict the accuracy
of ImageNet- ¯C. This figure shows that MANO has better estimation performance than the other
baselines when meeting different corruption types.

How to Use MANO in Real-World Applications?

This work demonstrates the strong correlation between ground-truth OOD accuracy and the designed
score, which can be particularly useful for model deployment applications. In this section, we provide
two examples.

• Find difficult (under-performed) test set. In cases such as retraining on under-performed
datasets or annotating hard datasets, we only need to know the rank of datasets by accuracy.
Therefore, we can calculate the proposed score for each dataset directly and fulfill the task
based on this score’s ranking.
• Deployement risk estimation. When deploying the model into production, it is important
to estimate its safety. If the cost of getting test labels is prohibitive, our method can help to
estimate the model’s accuracy on the product’s test data. A practitioner can additionally look
at the variability of the score on multiple test sets. When multiple datasets are not available,
we can alternatively construct adequate synthetic datasets via various visual transformations.

In Table 7, we provide an example, using 90% of datasets to train a linear regression model and
estimating the test accuracy of the rest 10% of datasets via the trained linear regression model. The
results are measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE). From this table, we observe the superiority of
MANO for application in the real world.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

31


---Page Break---
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

32


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All datasets used are open-source and all the implementation details are given
to reproduce the experimental results. The pseudo-code and all the implementation details
are given and an extensive ablation study was conducted. Only the code is not provided.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We use coefficients of determination and Spearman coefficient on test data,
hence no random seed is needed, and error bars are not applicable.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

33


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: All details to reproduce the experiments are given and our proposed method is
training-free once a pre-trained model is available.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel
must be specifically highlighted here.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

34


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All creators and owners are properly credited in the paper and code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

35


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
