Abstract

Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently advanced computer vision
tasks significantly, an important real-world problem was overlooked: adapting to
variable input resolutions. Typically, images are resized to a fixed resolution, such
as 224x224, for efficiency during training and inference. However, uniform input
size conflicts with real-world scenarios where images naturally vary in resolution.
Modifying the preset resolution of a model may severely degrade the performance.
In this work, we propose to enhance the model adaptability to resolution variation
by optimizing the patch embedding. The proposed method, called Multi-Scale
Patch Embedding (MSPE), substitutes the standard patch embedding with multiple
variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions,
eliminating the need to resize the original image. Our method does not require
high-cost training or modifications to other parts, making it easy to apply to most
ViT models. Experiments in image classification, segmentation, and detection
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MSPE, yielding superior performance on
low-resolution inputs and performing comparably on high-resolution inputs with
existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/SmallPigPeppa/

Introduction

Vision Transformers (ViTs) [1, 2, 3, 4] have achieved significant success in various computer vision
tasks, becoming a viable alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks [5, 6, 7, 8]. ViT
divides an image into multiple patches, converts these patches into tokens via the patch embedding
layer, and feeds them into the Transformer model [9, 10]. The token representations are usually
obtained using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Early CNN architectures like AlexNet [11]
were designed for fixed-size images (e.g., 224x224). For easy comparison, this setting has been
maintained by subsequent image recognition models, including ViT [2]. For fitting neural network
input layer size, ViTs typically resize the input image to a fixed resolution 2 and divide it into a specific
number of patches [12, 13, 14]. This practice restricts ViT models to processing single-resolution
inputs. However, fixed input sizes conflict with real-world scenarios where image resolution varies due
to camera devices/parameters, object size, and distance. This discrepancy can significantly degrade
ViT’s performance on different-resolution images. Changing the preset size requires retraining, and
every resolution necessitates an individual model. Therefore, a natural question arises: Is it possible
for a single ViT model to process different resolutions directly?

Figure 1: MSPE results on ImageNet-1K. We loaded a ViT-B model pre-trained on ImageNet-21K
from [19] and evaluated: (a) Height equals width, ranging from 28×28 to 896×896, and (b) Fixed
height=128, width ranging from 28 to 896. Vanilla ViT performance drops with size/aspect ratio
changes; FlexiViT [15] significantly improves performance, and our method surpasses FlexiVIT.

A few recent methods have been proposed for this problem: FlexiViT [15] uses a novel resizing
method allowing flexible patch size and token length in ViT. ResFormer [16] enhances resolution
adaptability through multi-resolution training and a global-local positional embedding strategy. NaViT
[17] leverages example packing [18] to adjust token lengths during training, boosting efficiency and
performance. However, these methods have two limitations. First, some of them are incompatible
with existing transformer models, preventing the effective use of pre-trained ViTs, and thus lead to
high re-training costs when applied. For example, models like NaViT and ResFormer require training
the entire model to achieve multi-resolution performance. Second, their multi-resolution performance
is insufficient. For example, FlexiViT demonstrates only slight performance improvement when the
input images are smaller than the preset size.

We intuitively believe that an ideal solution should be compatible with most existing ViT models and
perform well at any size and aspect ratio. To this end, we propose a method called Multi-Scale Patch
Embedding (MSPE). It replaces the patch embedding layer in standard ViT models without altering
the other parts of the model. This design makes MSPE compatible with most ViT models and allows
for low-cost, direct application. Specifically, our method uses a set of learnable adaptive convolution
kernels instead of fixed ones, which can automatically adjust the size and aspect ratio of the kernels
based on the input resolution. It directly converts images into patch embeddings without modifying
the input size or aspect ratio. The results in Figure 1 show that this simple method significantly
improves performance, for example, increasing ImageNet-1K accuracy up to 47.9% across various
resolutions. Our contributions are as follows:

• By analyzing resolution adaptability in ViT models, we identify the patch embedding layer
as the crucial component and provide a low-cost solution.

• We propose Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE), which enhances ViT models by sub-
stituting the standard patch embedding layer with learnable, adaptive convolution kernels,
enabling ViTs to be applied on any input resolution.

• Experiments demonstrate that with minimal training (only five epochs), MSPE significantly
enhances performance across different resolutions on classification, segmentation, and
detection tasks.

Preliminaries and Analysis

2.1
Vision Transformer Models

Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage the capabilities of the transformer model [20, 21], initially
developed for natural language processing, to address vision tasks [22, 23, 24]. ViTs primarily consist
of the patch embedding layer and Transformer encoder.

Patch Embedding converts an image x ∈Rh×w×c in the input space X into a sequence of tokens
{zi}N
i=1, where zi ∈Rd is a vector in patchification space Z. This transformation is achieved
via patch embedding layer gθ : X →Z, parameterized by θ. Specifically, the function gθ is
implemented as convolution convθ, using kernel wθ ∈Rhk×wk×d and bias bθ ∈Rd. The kernel size
is (hk, wk) and the stride is (hs, ws). In existing ViTs, patch embedding methods are categorized
into non-overlapping and overlapping types:

• Non-overlapping patch embedding: In standard Vision Transformers (e.g., ViT [2]), the
stride of convθ matches the kernel size, i.e., hs = hk and ws = wk. The number of tokens
N is calculated by

• Overlapping patch embedding: In models like PVT [4] and MViT [25], the stride is
smaller than the kernel size, i.e., hs < hk, ws < wk. The number of tokens N is calculated
by
l

Transformer Encoder adds position encodings posi to the token sequence, modifying it to {z′
i}N
i=1 =
{zi + posi}N
i=1. A class token zcls for global semantics is added to the front, i.e., {zcls, z′
1, . . . , z′
N}.
This sequence feeds into the Transformer Encoder Encϕ(z), parameterized by ϕ. For classification,
only the class token zcls is used to produce a probability distribution, and other tokens {z′
1, ..., z′
N}
are discarded.

2.2
Problem Formulation

In real-world scenarios, images have variable resolutions due to variations in camera devices, pa-
rameters, object scale, and imaging distance. Our task is to ensure the model adapts to different
resolutions. To this end, we resize the same image to multiple resolutions and optimize the model for
these diverse inputs. Here is the formal definition of this task:

Firstly, the process of resizing (e.g. bilinear reize) is formally defined as a linear transformation:
resizer∗
r (o) = Br∗
r vec(o).
(1)
where o ∈Rh×w is any input, the resolution r of (h, w) transforms to r∗of (h∗, w∗) after resizing,
using the transformation matrix Br∗
r
∈Rh∗w∗×hw. Each channel of x is resized independently.

For input (x, y) in dataset D, the learning objective is to minimize the loss function ℓ(e.g., cross-
entropy loss) across a series of resolutions {ri}M
i=1, optimizing performance at each resolution from
r1 to rM:
min
bθ, b
ϕ
E(x,y)∼D[ℓ(Encbϕ(gbθ(Bri
r x)), y]
∀ri ∈{ri}M
i=1

s.t. E(x,y)∼D[ℓ(Encbϕ(gbθ(x)), y)] ⩽E(x,y)∼D[ℓ(Encϕ(gθ(x)), y)] + ϵ, ϵ ⩾0,
(2)

where Enc ˆϕ(z) and gˆθ(x) are Transformer encoder and patch embedding layer, respectively. The
slack variable ϵ allows minor loss increments in the well-trained model Encϕ(gθ(x)).

The central challenge is maintaining acceptable performance across different resolutions from r1 to
rM but keeping the performance of original resolution r, which means adjustments of θ and ϕ must
be careful. In this work, we confirm the key role of patch embedding and only optimizing gθ:

bθ ∈arg min
bθ
E(x,y)∼D[ℓ(Encϕ(gbθ(Bri
r x)), y]
∀ri ∈{ri}M
i=1.
(3)

2.3
Pseudo-inverse Resize

To solve the optimization problems stated in Eq. (2) and (3), an intuitive solution appears to ensure
that embedding layer gθ produces consistent features on different resolutions. For this purpose,
FlexiViT [15] proposed PI-resize, which adjusts the embedding kernel to ensure uniform outputs:

{c
ωθ, c
bθ} = bθ ∈arg min
bθ
Ex∼X [(gbθ(Bri
r x) −gθ(x))2]
∀ri ∈{ri}M
i=1,

c
ωθ ∈arg min
c
ωθ
Ex∼X [(⟨x, ωθ⟩−⟨Bri
r x, c
ωθ⟩)2].
(4)

When upscaling with ri > r, the analytic solution for Eq. (4) is c
ωθ = Bri
r (Bri
r
T Bri
r )−1ωθ, denote
as (Bri
r
T )+ωθ:

⟨Bri
r x, c
ωθ⟩= xT Bri
r
T Bri
r (Bri
r
T Bri
r )−1ωθ = xT ωθ = ⟨x, ωθ⟩.
(5)

When downscaling with ri < r, the matrix Bri
r
T Bri
r is non-invertible. Under the assumption
X = N(0, 1), it is proven that (Bri
r
T )+ωθ is the optimal solution. In summary, Pseudo-inverse
resize (PI-resize) is defined as follows:
PI-resizer∗
r (w) = (Bri
r
T )+vec(w).

Figure 2: Similarity in patch embeddings does not guarantee optimal performance (a). We confirm
this by evaluating the accuracy and cosine similarity of: (b) patch embeddings {zi}N
i=1from 56x56
and 224x224 images, and (c) class tokens zcls from 56x56 and 224x224 images.

2.4
Motivation

However, is this optimization target in FlexiViT [15] truly appropriate? We suggest that there are
two problems with Equation 4: First, it is a stricter sufficient condition of Eq. (3), but it ignores
the impact of the encoder Encϕ(z) and the objective function ℓ. Second, at lower resolutions, i.e.
ri < r, this goal has no analytical solution; PI-resize is just an approximation assuming x ∼N(0, 1),
resulting in significant performance degradation.

Moreover, we intuitively suspect that similarity in patch embeddings does not ensure the best
performance. As Figure 2(a) illustrates, features derived from patch embeddings are transformed into
the classification feature space, namely the class token space, through the Transformer encoder Encϕ.
The gradient directions of these two feature spaces may not align, resulting in image features that are
close to optimal in patch embedding being far from the optimal class token after encoder processing.

A more effective method is directly adjusting the weights wθ of embedding layer using the objective
function ℓ(Eq. (3)). To verify this idea and our assumptions, we evaluate a well-trained ViT-
B/16 model [2] (pre-trained on ImageNet-21K, 224x224, 85.10% accuracy). We measure the
cosine similarity between patch embeddings {zi}N
i=1 and the class token zcls at resolutions of
56x56 and 224x224. The results in Figures 2 (b) and (c) show that FlexiViT has higher patch
embedding similarity and classification accuracy compared to the vanilla model; however, our method
significantly outperforms FlexiViT with even lower patch embedding similarity. These results confirm
that our analysis is reasonable.

3
Method

As discussed in Section 2.4, optimizing patch embedding layers through objective function is simple
but effective. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE). It divides the
resolution domain into different ranges {ri}M
i=1, each using a shared-weight patch embedding layer
that adjusts size through PI-resize. MSPE can replace the patch embedding layers in most ViT models,
including overlapping and non-overlapping types. Our method is illustrated in Figure 3 and presented
below.

3.1
Architecture of MSPE

MSPE only changes the patch embedding layer of the ViT model, making it directly applicable to
a well-trained ViT model. As demonstrated in Figure 3, we introduce the following architectural
modifications.

Multiple patching kernels. The typical patch embedding layer gθ employs a single convolution
size with parameters (ωθ, bθ), making it unsuitable for varying image resolutions. To overcome
this, MSPE incorporates K convolutions with differenet kernel sizes {g1
θ, . . . , gK
θ }, where each gi
θ is
parameterized by (wi
θ, bi
θ), to support a broader range of input image sizes.

Adaptive patching kernels. Although K convolutions of different kernel sizes improve adaptability,
they cannot cover all possible resolutions. Setting a unique size convolution kernel for each reso-
lution is unrealistic. In MSPE, the size and ratio of the kernel (wi
θ, bi
θ) are adjustable rather than
fixed. Specifically, for input x of any resolution (h, w), the corresponding kernel size (hk, wk) is

Figure 3: Illustration of the ViT model [2, 3] with MSPE. MSPE only replaces the patch embedding
layer in the vanilla model, making well-trained ViT models to be directly applied to any size and
aspect ratio. In our method, the patch embedding layer has several variable-sized kernels. The
Transformer encoder is shared and frozen.

(⌊h/N⌋, ⌊w/N⌋). Using Eq. (6), we adjust wi
θ to the corresponding size b
wi
θ ∈Rhk×wk. As shown
in Figure 3 (b), it can be directly convolved with the image patch.

Another module requiring careful design is the position embedding, which must correspond to the
feature map size after patch embedding. In ViT [2] and DeiT [3], the position embedding is bilinearly
interpolated to match the feature map size, a method known as resample absolute pos embed, and
it has proven effective during fine-tuning [3]. In MSPE, we discover that bilinear interpolation of
position embedding satisfies our requirements. To simplify the architecture and minimize changes to
the vanilla model, we follow this dynamic positional embedding method.

3.2
Learning Objectives

MSPE optimizes the patch embedding layer gθ through the objective function but does not explicitly
constrain the embedded tokens {zi}N
i=1 across different resolutions. Specifically, MSPE is based on
multi-resolution training (mixed resolution training), similar to methods like ResFormer and NaViT.
The training process is as follows.

Firstly, the mixed resolution {ri}M
i=1 is divided into K subsets {Sk}K
k=1, i.e. SK
k=1 Sk = {ri}M
i=1,
and rk is randomly sampled from Sk. The patching kernel weights θk are shared within Sk and
transformed into the corresponding weights bθk for each ri according to Eq. (6), The loss function is
defined as:

Lθ(x, y) =

K
X

i=1
ℓ[(Encϕ(gbθi(Bri
r x)), y] + λ · ℓ[(Encϕ(gθ(x)), y],
(7)

where ℓis the task loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss), and λ is a hyperparameter to prevent
performance degradation. We optimize only the patch embedding parameters θ during training,
setting the learning rate of ϕ to zero. Algorithm 1 in Appendix E.2 details the training procedure of
MSPE and PyTorch-style implementation.

3.3
Inference on Any Resolution

For an input x with any resolution r∗, previous models resize the image to a fixed resolution r. The
inference procedure is:
ˆy = Encϕ(gθ(Br
r∗x)),
(8)
With MSPE, the model can infer directly from the original image without resizing or altering its
aspect ratio. The process is:
ˆy = Encϕ(gθ∗(x)),

Experiments

Datasets. We conduct experiments on 4 benchmark datasets: ImageNet-1K [26] for classification
tasks, ADE20K [27] and Cityscapes [28] for semantic segmentation, and COCO2017 [29] for object
detection.

Backbone networks. Our method is assessed on three ViT models, including ViT-B [2] and DeiT-B
III [30] (non-overlapping patches); PVT v2-B3 [31] (overlapping patches). ViT and DeiT III are
pre-trained using the ImageNet-21K and ImageNet-22K datasets.

Implementation details. MSPE is trained using SGD optimizer for five epochs, with a learning
rate of 0.001, momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 0.0005, and batch size of 64 per GPU. To validate
our model, we implement ViT [2] and other networks [30, 4, 25] via open-sourced timm library
for classification, ViTDet [32] via MMDetection [33] for object detection, and SETR [34] via
MMSegmentation [35] for segmentation; additional details are available in Appendix B.

4.1
Image Classification

Comparison with FlexiViT. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, ViT models using non-overlapping
(like ViT and DeiT III) and overlapping patch embeddings (like PVTv2 and MViTv2) significantly
lose accuracy when the input resolution varies. This is consistent with the results from [15, 16, 17],
demonstrating that the vanilla ViT models are not adaptable to input resolution changes. This issue
primarily arises from their patch embedding layers failing to adjust to varying resolutions. This
leads to high-level features shifting after the patch tokens are fed into the Transformer encoder and
significantly degrading performance. FlexiViT shows remarkably stable performance at upscaled
resolutions (e.g., 448x448) by ensuring consistency of patch tokens across different resolutions, out-
performing vanilla models. However, as Section 3 analyzes, FlexiViT still struggles with downscaling.

Our method significantly boosts accuracy with targeted optimization goals, outperforming FlexiViT
across various resolutions and aspect ratios.

Comparison with ResFormer and NaViT. ResFormer improves performance by multi-resolution
training across 128x128, 160x160, and 224x224 resolutions. However, the modified ViT architecture
does not suit networks like PVT and MViT that use overlap patch embedding. Moreover, ResFormer
trains for 200 epochs, but our method requires only five epochs. NaViT keeps the original aspect ratio
and trains with mixed resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512, leveraging a larger JFT pre-training dataset
and longer training cycles (up to 920,000 steps). Table 1 and Figure 5 show that these state-of-the-art
methods improve the vanilla model remarkably. Compared to ResFormer and NaViT, MSPE achieves
superior multi-resolution performance with far fewer training resources, which proves the essential
role of optimized patch embedding layers.

Semantic Segmentation

Figure 5: Comparison of MSPE, Vanilla,
and NaViT: only NaViT was pre-trained
on the JFT dataset, baseline results come
from [17].

To validate the effectiveness of MSPE in semantic segmen-
tation, we test the SETR [34] model on ADE20K [27] and
Cityscapes [28] datasets, with the vanilla model trained
at 512x512 and 768x768 resolutions, respectively. Re-
sults in Table 2 show that FlexiViT significantly enhances
the vanilla model’s performance in semantic segmenta-
tion (e.g., 59.78 vs. 13.33 on the mIOU metric). This
confirms that adjusting the patch embedding layer is effec-
tive for pixel-level tasks, demonstrating its critical role in
enhancing multi-resolution robustness. Moreover, MSPE
consistently outperforms FlexiViT across various resolu-
tions, proving our method is ready for pixel-dense tasks
in real-world scenarios.

Object Detection

In our experiments on the COCO2017 dataset for object detection and instance segmentation,
we utilize the ViTDeT [32] model with ViT-B (pre-trained on ImageNet-1K via MAE [36]) and

employed Mask R-CNN [37] as the detection head. During the evaluation, we replace the ViT’s
patch embedding layer with MSPE or FlexiViT, keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged (
aligned with classification and segmentation ). As shown in Table 3, MSPE significantly improves the
multi-resolution performance of well-trained detection models. This result is consistent with those of
classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across different
visual tasks.

4.4
Ablation Study and Analysis

Training epochs. Figure 6 (a) presents the performance of MSPE on different training epochs (1, 3, 5).
It is observed that MSPE significantly enhances performance with only a few training epochs. The
models trained for 3 and 5 epochs show similar performance, with no significant improvement from
additional epochs. Thus, we train MSPE for 5 epochs in our experiments.

Model size. For evaluating the impact of model size on MSPE, we test on ImageNet-1K across
different sizes of DeiT III models (Small (S), Base (B), Large (L)), all pre-trained on ImageNet-22K.
As shown in Figure 6 (b), the results of the larger model DeiT-L and the smaller model DeiT-S align
with the main experiment; the larger model yields higher accuracy at different resolutions. This result
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method across models of different sizes.

Hyperparameters. We conduct ablation studies of hyperparameters λ in Figure 7 (a). When lambda
is set to 0, the learning of patch embedding is too flexible, leading to inadequate alignment with the
original parameter space. Lambda values of 1 and 2 lead to similar performances; this hyperparameter
is set to 1 in our experiments.

Kernel count K. Figure 7 (b) shows the impact of different kernel quantities on model performance.
In MSPE, the resolution ri is divided into K subsets, with each subset sharing the patch embedding
layer weights. Therefore, the number of subsets K equals the number of patchify kernels in MSPE.
The results indicate that slightly increasing K can improve performance. Specifically, when K = 3
and K = 4, the model performance is nearly identical, and additional kernels provide little improve-
ment. This suggests that patch embedding parameters can be shared across different resolutions. In
our method, K is set to 4.

Resizing method. In our method, the patch embedding weights are dynamically resized for images
with different sizes and ratios, denoted as adaptive kernels in Section 3.1. To evaluate the effect of
resizing methods on MSPE, we load an ImageNet-21K pre-trained ViT-B model from [19] and train
MSPE using different resizing methods, such as standard linear resizing. As shown in Figure 8, the

results indicate that PI-resize consistently outperforms other common resizing methods, aligning with
findings from the FlexiViT [15].

Parameters and computation overhead. As shown in Table 4, we analyze the impact of MSPE
on the parameter and computational cost of the vanilla VIT model. MSPE modifies only the
patch embedding layer gθ, increasing its parameter count by 2x~3x. However, MSPE provides a
more flexible approach to calculating patch embeddings, significantly reducing computational costs
compared to the original method. The total parameter count of the model remains nearly unchanged
because the patch embedding layer is an extremely small component.

Image resizing v.s. MSPE. Table 5 shows the comparison results of image resizing (IMG-resize)
and MSPE on ImageNet-1K. IMG-resize adjusts images of different resolutions to a preset resolution
(e.g., 224x224) during testing, whereas our method keeps the original image size and aspect ratio
unchanged. In real-world scenarios, resizing small-size images to a larger size incurs digitization
noise and increased computation costs, and model performance is not optimal at different resolutions.
The results indicate that our method comprehensively outperforms IMG-resize, suggesting that model
inference on the original images is a viable option.

Related Work

Most relevant to our work is FlexiViT [15], which proposed to resize the patch embedding weights,
enabling flexible patch sizes and token lengths in ViT models. Pix2struct [38] supports variable aspect
ratios by a novel positional embedding method, enhancing efficiency and performance in chart and
document understanding. ResFormer [16] enables resolution adaptability through multi-resolution
training and a global-local positional embedding strategy. NaViT [17] enhances efficiency and
performance by example packing [18] to adjust token lengths for different resolutions during training.
Compared to these methods, MSPE only changes the patch embedding layer and achieves better
performance. This justifies the patch embedding layer’s key role in adapting ViT models for different
resolutions.

In CNN-based models, Mind the Pooling [39] addresses overfitting on resolution by introducing
SBPooling to replace max-pooling, enabling CNNs to process different resolutions. Learn to Resize
[40] uses a learnable resizing layer to replace bilinear interpolation. Another study [41] examined
the relationship between training and testing resolutions, showing that training at slightly lower
resolutions than testing can improve performance. Networks like Resolution Adaptive Networks
(RANet) [42] and Dynamic Resolution Networks (DRNet) [43] use multiple sub-models to choose
the appropriate resolution and model based on task difficulty, thus enhancing model efficiency and
resolution adaptability.

Conclusion

To make ViT models compatible with images of different sizes and aspect ratios, we propose MSPE to
replace the traditional patch embedding layer for accommodating variable image resolutions. MSPE
uses multiple variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions,
eliminating the need to resize the original image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSPE
performs well in various visual tasks (image classification, segmentation, and detection). Particularly,
MSPE yields superior performance on low-resolution inputs and performs comparably on high-
resolution inputs with previous methods. Our method has the potential for application in various
vision tasks, and can be extended by optimizing the embedding layer and transformer encoder jointly.

A
Limitation

Our paper does not consider the impact of position embedding on model performance. This is because
existing work [2, 3] has shown that linear interpolation of position embedding can achieve acceptable
performance. Our experimental results validate the feasibility of this strategy. Moreover, we aim to
utilize our method within most existing ViT models, hence we do not alter the position embedding
method. In the future, our method can be extended with the positional encoding strategies proposed
in related works, such as ResFormer [16] and Pix2struct [38].

B
Training details

B.1
Multi-resolution training

Multi-resolution training has become a widely used paradigm [44, 45], randomly altering crop size
and aspect ratio during training. This training strategy is critical in multi-resolution vision models. In
FlexiViT [15] training, the size of image patches and the kernel size of the patch embedding layer
are randomly changed from 8x8 to 48x48. In ResFormer [16], input images are resized to 128×128,
160×160 and 224×224 and simultaneously training. In NaViT [17], images retain their original size
and aspect ratio and are packed into a single pack for training, denoted as mixed-resolution training.
The range of its training resolutions is 64 to 256. Our method is most similar to FlexiViT, randomly
resizing each image batch to different resolutions (from 56 to 256) during training.

B.2
Data augmentation

Classification. Our method leverages timm implementations of ViT [2], DeiT III [30], and PVT v2
[31] models for classification tasks. The training data augmentations include RandomResizedCrop,
RandomHorizontalFlip, and ColorJitter. For Resfomer [16], we follow the official-released code. Its
training data augmentation includes Auto-Augment [46], RandAugment [47], random erasing [48],
MixUp [49], and CutMix [50].

Semantic segmentation. We use the SETR [34] model implemented by MMSegmentation [35]. We
adhere data settings in MMSegmentation, including RandomResizedCrop, RandomFlip, and Photo-
MetricDistortion. PhotoMetricDistortion involves a series of transformations: random brightness,
random contrast, random saturation, random hue, and converting color between HSV and BGR.

Object detection. We employ the ViTDeT [32] model within the MMDetection [33] for object
detection and instance segmentation tasks. We utilize the configurations from MMDetection, which
include RandomResizedCrop and RandomFlip.

C
Compute resources

This paper conducts experiments on a machine equipped with two AMD EPYC 7543 32-core
processors; each slotted with 32 cores supporting two threads per core. The machine has 496 GB
of memory and 8* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards. Our method significantly reduces
computational resources compared to previous approaches, and all main experiments on ImageNet-1K
are completed within 3 hours. In contrast, methods like ResFormer [16] require over 50 hours of
training on this machine.

More experimental results

D.1
Impact of aspect ratio

In Section 4.1, we fixed the height and varied the width, ensuring the height was greater than the
width. We also tested the accuracy when fixing the width and varying the height, in which case the
width was greater than the height. It can be seen in Figure 9 that MSPE still achieved significant
performance improvements.

Furthermore, comparing the accuracy of resolutions (h, w) and (w, h) when h > w, we observe that
the accuracy of (h, w) resolution was higher than (w, h) resolution. This aligns with the findings

of NaViT [17], which indicate that a larger proportion of images in ImageNet-1K is h > w. This
suggests that maintaining the original aspect ratio during inference needs to be considered.

D.2
Results on Higher Resolution

Below are experimental results for high-resolution images. We resize ImageNet images (processed
to 224x224) up to 4096x4096 and evaluate models with non-overlapping patch embedding (ViT)
and overlapping patch embedding (PVT). The results in Table 6 show that MSPE can be effectively
applied to high-resolution images, as the shape and size of the patch embedding kernels dynamically
adjust based on input resolution and have multiple convolution kernels corresponding to different
resolution ranges.

Extra training epochs

In our main experiment, MSPE is trained for 5 epochs. We increase the number of epochs to analyze
its performance under extended training. As shown in Table 7, the performance improvement with
longer training epochs is minimal. This is because MSPE requires learning a very small number of
parameters, which can reach optimal performance within just a few epochs of training. This indicates
that our method achieves better performance and requires less training overhead, making it highly
compatible with well-trained models.

ing methods in MSPE.

Figure 11: Computational Overhead of MSPE at
Different Resolutions.

D.4
Other resizing methods

We test other resizing methods in MSPE, including nearest and bicubic3. As shown in Figure 10,
these traditional resizing methods are not suitable for adjusting the size of neural network parameters,
leading to less robust patch embeddings in MSPE training. The experimental results are consistent
with Section 4.4, confirming that the combination of PI-resize and MSPE have significant potential
applied to multi-resolution models.

D.5
Computation overhead

We evaluate MSPE’s computational overhead across resolutions from 32x32 to 448x448. MSPE
dynamically adjusts its parameters based on image resolution. For overlapping patch embedding
models like PVT and MViT, MSPE adjusts the convolutional kernel size and stride. For non-
overlapping patch embedding models like ViT, MSPE adjusts the convolutional kernel size. As
shown in Figure 11, MSPE’s computational overhead changes dynamically, avoiding the unnecessary
computational costs associated with resizing images to a fixed resolution.

E
More details on MSPE

In this section, we provide more details about the implementation of MSPE, including modifications
to the model structure and the training process, and its application for inference at any resolution.

E.1
Inference on any resolution

For an input image x with any resolution r, we calculate its patch embedding parameters θ∗,
composed of w∗and b∗. We directly compute the patch embedding z on the original image x as
follows: z = conv(x, w∗) + b. After that, embedding z is fed into the Transformer encoder Enc(z)
as usual. In this process, calculating θ∗is a crucial step. We compute θ∗by finding the resolution
ri in the resolution sequence riM
i=1 that is closest to the original resolution r∗and then resizing its
kernel to match the original resolution. This process is formalized as follows:

i ∈arg
M
min
i=1
||ri −r∗||
∀ri ∈{ri}M
i=1,

w∗= (Br∗
ri

T )+vec(wi
θ)

θ∗= {w∗, bi
θ}.

(10)

E.2
MSPE structure and training process

As depicted in Section 3.1, MSPE modifies two parts of the ViT model, as shown in the class ViT
of Algorithm 1. 1) It adds K patch embedding kernels. 2) During patch embedding, the size and
aspect ratio of the kernels can be adjusted based on the input. Here, g and Enc represent the patch
embedding layer gθ and the Transformer encoder Encϕ(z).

3Bicubic resizing is implemented by F.interpolate(x, mode="bicubic") in PyTorch.

15


---Page Break---
The implementation of multi-resolution training in Section 3.1 is as follows: We randomly select K
resolutions from a range of resolutions {ri}M
i=1, then compute the corresponding patch embeddings.
After that, the model computes the loss as usual.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: The related experimental results are Section 2 , and we cite FlexiViT’s conclu-
sion regarding PI-resize.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 and Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix E.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 4 and Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The random error in the experiments can be ignored and does not affect the
conclusions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

19


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
