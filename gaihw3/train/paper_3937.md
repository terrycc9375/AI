Abstract

Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current
language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these
hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be
explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer
encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HITs), harnessing the
expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding
space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincaré ball with a curvature that adapts to the
embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal
losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as
texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HITs against pre-trained LMs,
standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing
on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions,
and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HITs
consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness
and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.1

Introduction

In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related areas, the emergence of transformer-
based language models (LMs) such as BERT (encoder-based) [1], GPT (decoder-based) [2], and
the more recent large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 [3] and Llama 2 [4], has marked a
significant progression. Nonetheless, these models face a notable challenge in effectively encoding
and interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language. This limitation has been highlighted by
several studies, including those by [5] and [6], which employed prompt-based probes to reveal the
limited hierarchical knowledge in pre-trained LMs, and the work by [7], which demonstrated these
models’ struggles with capturing the transitivity of hierarchical relationships.

Prior research has explored various methods to infuse hierarchical information into LM training.
Common approaches include classification-based fine-tuning using sentence head embedding with a
classification layer [8] or few-shot prompting with an answer mapping to classification labels [6].
To further pre-train, or re-train2 LMs on a corpus constructed from hierarchical data, [9] converted

is distinguished from standard fine-tuning that involves adding task-specific layers which lead to additional
learnable parameters.

structural representations into textual formats to align the masked language modeling objective.
Others, like [10] and [11], have focused on extracting analogous and contrasting examples from
hierarchical structures for a similarity-based contrastive learning objective. The aforementioned
studies leveraged hierarchical information as implicit signals to augment LMs, yet no existing works
specifically targeted the explicit encoding of hierarchies with LMs.

Figure 1: Illustration of how hierarchies are explic-
itly encoded in HITs. The square (d-dimensional
hyper-cube) refers to the output embedding space
of transformer encoder-based LMs whose final ac-
tivation function is typically tanh, and the circum-
scribed circle (d-dimensional hyper-sphere) refers
to the Poincaré ball of radius
√

d. The distance and
norm metrics involved in our hyperbolic losses are
defined w.r.t. this manifold.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel ap-
proach to re-train transformer encoder-based
LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders
(HITs). Inspired by the efficacy of hyperbolic
geometry in representing hierarchical structures
[12, 13], we propose the hyperbolic cluster-
ing and centripetal losses tailored for LM re-
training. As illustrated in Figure 1, transformer
encoder-based LMs typically use a tanh acti-
vation function in the last layer, which maps
each embedding dimension to the range [−1, 1].
Consequently, the output embeddings of LMs
are confined within a unit d-dimensional hyper-
cube. Leveraging this characteristic, we utilise
a Poincaré ball of radius
√

d, whose boundary
circumscribes3 the output embedding space of
LMs. The metrics for distance and norm used
in our hyperbolic losses are defined w.r.t. this
specific manifold. After re-training, entities are
not only clustered according to their relatedness
but also hierarchically organised.

In evaluating HITs, we compare their performance against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs,
and previous hyperbolic embedding models in the Multi-hop Inference and Mixed-hop Prediction
tasks. The Multi-hop Inference task, following the setting in [13], involves training models on all
asserted (i.e., one-hop) subsumptions and assessing their ability to infer transitive (i.e., multi-hop)
subsumptions. The Mixed-hop Prediction task is designed to mirror real-world scenarios, where
models trained on incomplete hierarchy are applied to predict unknown subsumption relationships
between arbitrary entity pairs. Additionally, we introduce a transfer learning setting, where models
trained on one hierarchy are tested on another. Our experiments utilise datasets derived from WordNet
[14] and SNOMED CT [15],4 and transfer evaluation datasets from Schema.org [16], Food Ontology
(FoodOn) [17], and Disease Ontology (DOID) [18]. The results show that HITs significantly surpass
all baselines in these tasks, demonstrating their robustness to generalise from asserted to inferred and
unseen subsumptions, and a promising potential in hierarchy-based semantic search.

Preliminaries

2.1
Language Models

Transformer encoder-based LMs excel in providing fine-grained contextual word embeddings for
enhanced language understanding. A key component of these models is the self-attention mechanism,
which dynamically assigns importance to different segments of the input text, thereby capturing
nuanced contextual semantics more effectively. Notable examples of such models include BERT
[1] and RoBERTa [19], both of which utilise the masked language modelling objective during pre-
training. This approach involves partially masking input sentences and prompting the model to predict
the masked tokens, using the unmasked surrounding text as context. For acquiring sentence-level
embeddings, these models can be augmented with an additional pooling layer, applied over the token
embeddings [20, 21]. Pooling strategies such as mean, max, and sentence head pooling are employed,
with their effectiveness varying across different applications. A contrastive learning objective is
often applied for refining sentence-level semantics [21, 22]. Despite the rise of generative LLMs,

3We ignore the vertices of the hyper-cube, as they are on the boundary and thus are undefined in the open
Poincaré ball.
4Results on WordNet are presented in Section 4, while results on SNOMED CT are presented in Appendix D.

transformer encoder-based LMs maintain their importance, offering versatility and efficiency in tasks
like text classification and semantic search.

2.2
Hyperbolic Geometry

Hyperbolic geometry, a form of non-Euclidean geometry, is featured by its constant negative Gaussian
curvature, a fundamental aspect that differentiates it from the flat, zero curvature of Euclidean
geometry. In hyperbolic space, distances between points increase exponentially as one moves towards
the boundary, making it inherently suitable for embedding hierarchical structures. This intuition
aligns with the tree embedding theorem based on δ-hyperbolicity, as discussed in [23] and [13].

Among the various models5 of hyperbolic geometry that are isometric6 to each other, the Poincaré
ball is chosen for its capacity to contain the the output embedding space of LMs directly, as explained
in the second last paragraph of Section 1. The d-dimensional Poincaré ball with a negative curvature
−c (where c > 0) is defined by the open ball Bd
c = {x ∈Rd : ∥x∥2 < 1

c}. The distance function in
this model, dependent on the curvature value c, is given by:

dc(u, v) = 2
√c tanh−1(√c∥−u ⊕c v∥)
(1)

In this equation, u, v ∈Bd
c, ∥·∥denotes the Euclidean norm, and ⊕c denotes the Möbius addition
[24] defined as:

u ⊕c v = (1 + 2c⟨u, v⟩+ c∥v∥2)u + (1 −c∥u∥2)v

1 + 2c⟨u, v⟩+ c2∥u∥2∥v∥2
(2)

Here, ⟨·, ·⟩denotes the inner product in Euclidean space. Note that for flat curvature c = 0, Bd
c will
be Rd and ⊕c will be the Euclidean addition.

2.3
Hierarchy

We define a hierarchy as a directed acyclic graph G(V, E) where V represents vertices that symbolise
entities, and E represents edges that indicate the direct subsumption relationships asserted in the
hierarchy. We can then derive indirect subsumption relationships T based on direct ones through
transitive reasoning. We borrow the notation from description logic to denote the subsumption
relationship as e1 ⊑e2, meaning that e1 is a sub-class of e2. Under the closed-world assumption, we
consider an edge (e1, e2) as a negative sample if (e1, e2) ̸∈E ∪T . Particularly, a hard negative is
identified when e1 and e2 are also siblings that share the same parent.

Explicit hierarchies can often be derived from structured data sources such as taxonomies, ontologies,
and knowledge graphs. A taxonomy and the Terminology Box (TBox) of an ontology intrinsically
define subsumptions, whereas in knowledge graphs, hierarchical relationships are defined in a more
customised manner. For instance, in WordNet, the hypernym relationship corresponds to subsumption.

Hierarchy Transformer Encoder

We intend to propose a general and effective strategy to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs
as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HITs). To deal with arbitrary input lengths of entity names,
we employ an architecture similar to sentence transformers [21], incorporating a mean pooling
layer over token embeddings to produce sentence embeddings for entities. Note that some of the
sentence transformer models have a normalisation layer after pooling; we exclude this layer because
its presence will constrain the embeddings’ Euclidean norms to one, thus hindering hierarchical
organisation of entity embeddings. It is also worth mentioning that these changes do not add in
learnable parameters besides the ones already in LMs, thus retaining the original architectures of
LMs as encoders. As aforementioned, the output embedding space of these LMs is typically a

d-dimensional hyper-cube because of the tanh activation function in the last layer. Thus, we can
construct a Poincaré ball of radius
√

d (or equivalently, curvature value c = 1

d) whose boundary
circumscribes the hyper-cube.7 Unlike previous hyperbolic embedding methods that utilise the entire
hyperbolic space and often require a projection layer to manage out-of-manifold embeddings, our
method ensures that embeddings are contained within a specific subset of this manifold. Empirical
evidence supports that this subset sufficiently accommodates entities in high-dimensional space (see
Section 4.5). Based on this curvature-adapted manifold, we propose the following two losses for
hierarchy re-training.

Hyperbolic Clustering Loss This loss aims at clustering related entities and distancing unrelated
ones in the Poincaré ball. We formulate it in the form of triplet loss because related entities are
not equivalent but their semantic distances should be smaller than those between unrelated entities.
Formally, the loss is defined as:

Lcluster =
X

(e,e+,e−)∈D
max(dc(e, e+) −dc(e, e−) + α, 0)
(3)

Here, inputs are presented in the form of triplet (e, e+, e−), where e+ is a parent entity of e, and e−
is a negative parent entity of e; D denotes the set of these triplets; dc(·, ·) refers to the hyperbolic
distance function defined in Equation (1), and α is the hyperbolic distance margin. The bold letters
denote the embeddings of the corresponding entities.

Hyperbolic Centripetal Loss This loss ensures parent entities are positioned closer to the Poincaré
ball’s origin than their child counterparts, reflecting the natural expansion of hierarchies from the
origin to the boundary of the manifold. The term “centripetal” is used to imply that the manifold’s
origin represents an imaginary root entity for everything. Formally, the hyperbolic centripetal loss
is defined as:
Lcentri =
X

(e,e+,e−)∈D
max(∥e+∥c −∥e∥c + β, 0)
(4)

Again, inputs are the triplets in D, but only the child and parent entities (the positive subsumptions)
are used to calculate the loss; ∥·∥c := dc(·, 0) refers to the hyperbolic norm; β is the hyperbolic norm
margin.

The overall hierarchy re-training loss, denoted as LHIT, is the linear combination of these two
hyperbolic losses, defined as:
LHIT = Lcluster + Lcentri

Figure 2: Illustration of the impact of LHIT during
training. In Euclidean space, it seems contradic-
tory that both “phone” and “computer” are pulled
towards “e-device” but are also pushed away from
each other. However, in principle this is not a prob-
lem in hyperbolic space, where distances increase
exponentially relative to Euclidean distances as
one moves from the origin to the boundary of the
manifold.

In Figure 2, we demonstrate the impact of LHIT
on entity embeddings. The entity “e-device”,
being most general, is nearest to the origin. Sib-
ling entities, such as “phone” and “computer”,
“laptop” and “pc”, are closer to their common
parent than to each other, illustrating the effect
of re-training to cluster related entities while
maintain hierarchical relationships.

As the HIT model functions as an encoder, it
does not inherently support direct predictions
of subsumption relationships. To address this,
we devise a probing function that leverages the
hierarchy re-trained entity embeddings. This
function aims to predict the subsumption rela-
tionship for any given pair of entities (e1, e2),
incorporating both the clustering and centripetal
heuristics:
s(e1 ⊑e2) = −(dc(e1, e2) + λ(∥e2∥c −∥e1∥c))
(6)
Here, λ > 0 represents a weighting factor applied to the centripetal heuristic component. The
subsumption score is structured to increase as the hyperbolic distance between e1 and e2 decreases,

7We have also considered scaling down each dimension of the LM embeddings by
√

d to confine them within
a unit Poincaré ball, but we found that losses are harder to converge in this construction.

and/or as the relative difference in their hyperbolic norms (∥e1∥c −∥e2∥c) increases. Essentially, for
the model to predict e1 ⊑e2, it is expected that e1 and e2 are relatively closer in the Poincaré ball,
with e1 positioned further from the manifold’s origin compared to e2. The value for λ and the overall
scoring threshold are to be ascertained through hyperparameter tuning on the validation set.

Evaluation

4.1
Task Definition

Multi-hop Inference This task, following the setting in [13], aims to evaluate the model’s ability
in deducing indirect, multi-hop subsumptions T from direct, one-hop subsumptions E, so as to
simulate transitive inference. We split T for validation and testing, denoted as Tval and Ttest,
respectively. For each positive subsumption (e, e+) involved, we sampled 10 negative parents e−for
e, leading to 10 training triplets8. Following the criteria in Section 2.3, (e, e−) is a valid negative if
(e, e−) ̸∈E ∪T . We further split the task into two settings: one with random negatives and another
with hard negatives, the latter mainly comprising sibling entities. Since not every entity has enough
siblings, we supplemented with random negatives that have been sampled to maintain a consistent
positive-to-negative ratio of 1 : 10.

Mixed-hop Prediction This task aims to evaluate the model’s capability in determining the existence
of subsumption relationships between arbitrary entity pairs, where the entities are not necessarily
seen during training. We propose a challenging setting where models are trained on incomplete
direct subsumptions and examined on a mix of hold-out, unseen direct and indirect (mixed-hop)
subsumptions. We split E into training, validation, and test sets, denoted as Etrain, Eval, and Etest,
respectively. The final training, validataion, and test sets for this task are Etrain, Eval ∪Tval, and
Etest ∪Ttest, respectively, where Tval and Ttest are re-used from the previous task. Again, each
positive subsumption in these sets is paired with 10 negative samples, either randomly chosen or
from sibling entities. Furthermore, an important factor that reflects the model’s generalisability is to
examine the transfer ability across hierarchies. To this end, we extend the mixed-hop prediction
task with a transfer setting where models trained on asserted training edges of one hierarchy are
tested on arbitrary entity pairs of another.

Evaluation Metrics For both Multi-hop Inference and Mixed-hop Prediction tasks, we utilise
Precision, Recall, and F1 score (abbreviated as F-score in latter discussion) as our primary metrics
of evaluation. We have opted not to include Accuracy, as preliminary testing indicated a potential
bias in this metric, with a misleadingly high score resulting from the much larger volume of negative
compared to positive samples. It is important to note that, although the training phase uses entity
triplets, the evaluation only involves entity pairs.

4.2
Dataset Construction

We constructed the primary dataset from the noun hierarchy of WordNet [14] due to its comprehensive
and structured representation of linguistic hierarchies. To assess the transferability and robustness

810 training triplets are constructed from 11 entity pairs.

across different domains, we additionally constructed datasets from ontologies that represent varied
semantic granularities and domains, namely Schema.org [16], Food Ontology (FoodOn) [17], and
Disease Ontology (DOID) [18]. We retrieved WordNet from NLTK [25] and adopted pre-processing
steps similar to [12], utilising the hypernym relations between noun synsets to construct the hierarchy.
For Schema.org, FoodOn, and DOID, our pre-processing paralleled that in [6], transforming these
ontologies into hierarchies of named entities (details in Appendix A). To accommodate the textual
input requirements of LMs, we constructed an entity lexicon using the name attribute in WordNet
and the rdfs:label property in the ontologies.9

On WordNet (Noun), FoodOn, and DOID, we adopt a consistent splitting ratio for the validation and
testing sets. Specifically, we allocate two separate 5% portions of the indirect subsumptions T to
form Tval and Ttest, respectively. Similarly, two distinct 5% portions of the direct subsumptions E
are used as Eval and Etest. As Schema.org is significantly smaller than the other hierarchies and only
used for transfer evaluation, we split its entire E and T sets into halves for validation and testing,
respectively. Table 1 presents the extracted hierarchies’ statistics and the resulting datasets for the
Multi-hop Inference and Mixed-hop Prediction tasks.

In addition to our main evaluation, we constructed a dataset from the widely-recognised biomedical
ontology SNOMED CT [15] and conducted futher evaluation. The relevant details are presented in
Appendix D.

4.3
Baselines

Naive Prior We first introduce a naive baseline (NaivePrior) that utilises the prior probability of
positive subsumptions in the training set for prediction. Given that each positive sample is paired
with 10 negatives, the prior probability of a positive prediction stands at
1
11. Consequently, Precision,
Recall, and F-score on the test set are all
1
11.

Pre-trained LMs We consider pre-trained LMs as baselines to illustrate their limitations in capturing
hierarchical structure semantics. As outlined in Section 3, our focus is on LMs based on the sentence
transformer architecture [21]. Since these LMs are optimised for cosine similarities between sentences,
we devise the following probe for evaluation: for each entity pair (e1, e2), we compute the cosine
similarity between the masked reference sentence “e1 is a ⟨mask⟩.” and the sample sentence “e1
is a e2.”. These similarity scores serve as the subsumption scores, with thresholds identified via
grid search on the validation set. Note that although these LMs originate from masked language
models, they cannot be easily probed via mask filling logits or perplexities as in [26] and [27] because
their mask filling layers are not preserved in the released versions. We select three top-performing
pre-trained LMs from the sentence transformer library of different sizes, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2
(22.7M), all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (33.4M), and all-mpnet-base-v2 (109M).

Fine-tuned LMs Fine-tuned LMs are used as baselines to demonstrate that despite the efficacy
in various tasks, standard fine-tuning struggles to address this specific challenge. Following the
BERTSubs approach outlined in [8], we employ pre-trained LMs with an added linear layer for binary
classification, and optimising on the Softmax loss. [8] have shown that this method outperforms
various structure-based embeddings such as TransE [28] and DistMult [29], and also surpasses
OWL2Vec* [30], which integrates both structural and textual embeddings, in subsumption prediction.

Hyperbolic Baselines Previous static hyperbolic embedding models are typically evaluated using
the Multi-hop Inference task. In our study, we select the Poincaré Embedding (PoincaréEmbed) [12]
and the Hyperbolic Entailment Cone (HyperbolicCone) [13] as baselines on this task. However, their
lack of inductive prediction capabilities prevents their evaluation on the Mixed-hop Prediction task
and its transfer setting. Additionally, we include the hyperbolic GloVe embedding (PoincaréGloVe)
as a baseline in our transfer evaluation. We select the best-performing PoincaréGloVe (50×2D
with an initial trick) pre-trained on a 1.4B token English Wikipedia dump. While PoincaréGloVe
supports inductive prediction, its effectiveness is limited by word-level tokenisation, rendering it less
effective at handling unknown words. To address this, we employ NaivePrior as a fallback method
for entities that involve unknown words and cannot be predicted by PoincaréGloVe.

More details of our code implementation and experiment settings are presented in Appendix B.

9We selected the first name (in English) if multiple names for one entity were available.

Results

The effectiveness of our hierarchy re-training approach is evident from the results of both the Multi-
hop Inference and Mixed-hop Prediction tasks on WordNet (see Table 2), as well as the Transfer
Mixed-hop Prediction task on Schema.org, FoodOn, and DOID for pre-trained LMs and models
trained on WordNet (see Table 3). In the following, we present several pivotal findings based on these
results.

Performance of HITs The HIT models, re-trained from LMs of various sizes, consistently out-
perform their pre-trained and standard fine-tuned counterparts across all evaluation tasks. In the
Multi-hop Inference task, HITs exhibit exceptional performance with F-scores ranging from 0.871 to
0.916. This indicates a strong capability in generalising from asserted to transitively inferred entity
subsumptions. In the Mixed-hop Prediction task, F-scores ranging from 0.856 to 0.900 highlight the
effectiveness of HITs in generalising from asserted to arbitrary entity subsumptions. For the Trans-
fer Mixed-hop Prediction tasks, we selected all-MiniLM-L12-v2 as the pre-trained model because
all-MiniLM-L12-v2+HIT attains comparable performance to all-mpnet-base-v2+HIT while it is
more computationally efficient owing to a smaller parameter size. Notably, all-MiniLM-L12-v2+HIT
performs better than pre-trained and fine-tuned all-MiniLM-L12-v2 on these transfer tasks by at least
0.150 and 0.101 in F-scores, respectively.

Limited Hierarchical Knowledge in Pre-trained LMs For the tasks on WordNet, all-mpnet-base-
v2 achieves the highest F-scores among all the pre-trained models, yet these scores (e.g., 0.347 and
0.250 on the Mixed-hop Prediction task with random negatives and hard negatives, respectively)
are considerably lower compared to their fine-tuned (lagging by 0.304 and 0.419) and hierarchy
re-trained (lagging by 0.553 and 0.613) counterparts. This disparity confirms findings from LM
probing studies such as those by [5] and [6], demonstrating the limited hierarchical knowledge in
pre-trained LMs.

Limited Generalisation in Fine-tuned LMs The research by [8] illustrates that fine-tuned LMs
perform well on single-hop subsumptions. Our observations concur, showing that fine-tuned LMs
achieve comparable performance as HITs when assessed on just single-hop test samples. However,
their effectiveness wanes when applied to arbitrary entity subsumptions. For the tasks on WordNet,
fine-tuned LMs underperform HITs by 0.194 to 0.301 in F-scores. In the transfer task from WordNet
to Schema.org, the fine-tuned all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model only marginally outperforms its initial state,
with an increase of around 0.02 in F-scores across both negative settings.

Performance of Hyperbolic Baselines The Multi-hop Inference task with random negatives follows
the evaluation in [13]. In this setup, both PoincaréEmbed and HyperbolicCone significantly
outperform the pre-trained and standard fine-tuned LMs, and perform comparably to the HIT models.
However, HyperbolicCone exhibits substantially worse performance in the hard negative setting;
its low precision and high recall suggest difficulties in differentiating sibling entities that are closely
positioned in the embedding space. In the transfer evaluation, PoincaréGloVe shows improved
performance over pre-trained and standard fine-tuned models on Schema.org. However, it does not
demonstrate a similar advantage on FoodOn and DOID, primarily due to its limited vocabulary, which
allows it to predict almost all test samples on Schema.org but substantially fewer on the others.

Comparison of Random and Hard Negatives For the tasks on WordNet, hard negative settings
present greater challenges compared to random negative settings for all pre-trained LMs. This
increased difficulty, however, is not as pronounced in fine-tuned LMs and HITs. A plausible
explanation is that while hard negatives pose challenges, they simultaneously act as high-quality
adversarial examples, potentially leading to more robust training outcomes. In the Transfer Mixed
Prediction task, hard negative settings are generally more challenging than random negative settings.
For instance, in the WordNet-to-DOID transfer task, both fine-tuned and hierarchy re-trained all-
MiniLM-L12-v2 models exhibit significantly higher F-scores in the random negative setting, with
differences of 0.306 and 0.138 respectively, compared to the hard negative setting.

Case Analysis on WordNet-to-DOID Transfer In the WordNet-to-DOID transfer task, the disparity
in the “disease” category is notable: WordNet contains only 605 entities that are descendants of
“disease”, compared to over 10K in DOID. Despite this significant difference, HIT models effectively
transfer knowledge, achieving F-scores of 0.704 (random negatives) and 0.566 (hard negatives).

More discussion on loss functions and an ablation study of loss margins are presented in Appendix C.

These norms effectively capture the natural ex-
pansion of the hierarchical structure, evidenced
by an exponential rise in the number of child
entities. A notable observation is the sharp de-
cline in the number of entities when hyperbolic
norms exceed 23, suggesting that few entities
reside at these higher levels. Additionally, the
range of entity hyperbolic norms, approximately
from 8 to 24, indicates that a relatively small re-
gion of the high-dimensional manifold suffices
to accommodate all entities in WordNet.

Correlation In Table 4, we compare the Pear-
son correlation coefficients across different hy-
perbolic models to measure the linear relation-
ship between entities’ hyperbolic norms and
their depths in WordNet. Our analysis shows
that all hyperbolic models lead to a positive cor-
relation between norms and depths, as expected.
However, HIT demonstrates a stronger correla-
tion than both PoincaréEmbed and Hyperbol-
icCone.

Case Study In Table 5, we showcase the effec-
tiveness of HIT using selected entities: “com-
puter”, “pc”10, “fruit”, and “berry”. The table
presents the hyperbolic distances between these
entities’ embeddings, their individual hyperbolic
norms, and their depths11 in the WordNet hier-
archy. We can observe that: (i) closely related
entities, such as “fruit” and “berry”, are signifi-
cantly nearer to each other compared to more distant pairs; (ii) more specific entities like “pc” and
“berry” are positioned further from the origin of the manifold than their ancestor entities; (iii) the
disparity in hyperbolic norms between “pc” and “computer” is greater compared to that between
“fruit” and “berry”, reflecting the hierarchical depth where “pc” is a grandchild of “computer”, while
“berry” is a direct child of “fruit”.

Related Work

Prompt-based probing is widely used for extracting knowledge from LMs. Studies like [5] utilised
cloze-style prompts for hypernym detection, while [6] approached subsumption prediction similar to
Natural Language Inference. [7] examined if LMs, when correctly predicting “A is a B” and “B is a
C”, can consistently infer the transitive relationship “A is a C”. These studies collectively highlight
the limited capacity of pre-trained LMs in understanding hierarchical structures. Other research
efforts, such as those by [10] and [11], have aimed to incorporate structural semantics into LMs for
entity encoding. However, these largely focus on entity equivalence or similarity, with less emphasis
on hierarchical organisation.

Regarding hyperbolic embeddings, methods like the Poincaré embedding [12] and the hyperbolic
entailment cone [13] have effectively represented hierarchical structures. Despite their efficacy, these
techniques are inherently static, constrained by a fixed vocabulary of entities, and do not support

node, we set up an imaginary root node when calculating the depth.

inductive predictions about unseen data. Further explorations include learning word embeddings in
hyperbolic space [31, 32]. These methods, however, are limited to word-level tokenisation and yield
non-contextual word representations. These shortcomings can be mitigated by integrating hyperbolic
embeddings with transformer-based LMs. [33] has explored this direction, applying learnable layers
to project LM embeddings into hyperbolic space for syntax parsing and sentiment analysis. Our
approach diverges from theirs by focusing on training LMs as general hierarchy encoders without the
need for additional learnable parameters.

Conclusion

This paper tackles the challenge of enabling language models to interpret and encode hierarchies. We
devise the hierarchy re-training approach that involves a joint optimisation on both the hyperbolic
clustering and hyperbolic centripetal losses, aiming to cluster and organise entities according to their
hierarchical relationships. The resulting HIT models demonstrate proficiency in simulating transitive
inference and predicting subsumptions within and across hierarchies. Additionally, our analysis of
HIT embeddings highlights their geometric interpretability, further validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Limitations and Future Work

This work does not address the potential loss of pre-trained language understanding resulted from
hierarchy re-training. Also, the issue of entity naming ambiguity inherent in the dataset sources is not
tackled, which could introduce noise into the training process.

For future work, several promising directions can be pursued: (i) investigating methods to measure
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting, (ii) training a HIT model across multiple hierarchies, either for
general or domain-specific applications, (iii) extending HIT to accommodate multiple hierarchical
relationships within a single model, and (iv) developing hierarchy-based semantic search that contrasts
with traditional similarity-based approaches.

A
Hierarchy Construction from Ontologies

The Terminology Box (TBox) in an OWL (Web Ontology Language)12 ontology defines entity
relationships using subsumption axioms (C ⊑D) and equivalence axioms (C ≡D), where C and D
are atomic or complex concept expressions defined in the description logic SROIQ. In this work,
we used atomic concepts as nodes of the hierarchy. We employed an ontology reasoner to deduce
direct13 subsumptions and included these as edges in the hierarchy. This approach fully considers
both subsumption and equivalence axioms for all potential edges. Considering an atomic concept
Beef, which is defined by Beef ≡Meat ⊓∃derivesFrom.Cattle, as an example, the reasoning will
lead to an edge between Beef and Meat. Without reasoning, Beef will be misplaced under the root
node, if no other subsumptions about Beef are asserted in the ontology. Tools like Protégé14 also
demonstrate similar considerations in presenting ontology concept taxonomies.

It is also important to note the variability in naming schemes across different ontologies, which
sometimes necessitates pre-processing of entity names. [6] provided detailed pre-processing steps for
Schema.org, FoodOn, and DOID. In this study, we used the pre-processed versions of FoodOn and
DOID and applied the same pre-processing methodology to the latest version of Schema.org.

B
Experiment Settings

The code implementation of this work primarily depends on DeepOnto [34] for processing hierar-
chies and constructing datasets, Geoopt [35] for Poincaré ball, Sentence-Transformers [21] and
Huggingface-Transformers [36] for training and evaluation of LMs. All our experiments were
conducted on a single Quadro RTX 8000 GPU.

In the hierarchy re-training of our HIT models, we configured the hyperbolic clustering loss margin
(α in Equation 3) at 5.0 and the hyperbolic centripetal loss margin (β in Equation 4) at 0.1. An
exception was made for all-mpnet-base-v2 with hard negatives, where α was adjusted to 3.0, based
on validation. The models were trained for 20 epochs, with a training batch size of 256, 500 warm-up
steps and an initial learning rate of 10−5, using the AdamW optimiser [37]. Model selection was
conducted after each epoch, guided by performance on the validation set.

For standard fine-tuning, we largely adhered to the default settings of the Huggingface Trainer15, but
maintained the same training batch size as used in the hierarchy re-training. Notably, our preliminary
testing revealed that fine-tuning is more prone to overfitting. Consequently, we adopted a more
frequent model selection interval, performing this assessment every 500 training steps rather than
epoch-wise.

For our hyperbolic baselines, we trained PoincaréEmbed with an embedding dimension of 200
for 200 epochs, a training batch size of 256, 10 warm-up epochs, and a constant learning rate of
0.01, using the Riemannian Adam optimiser [38]. According to [13], HyperbolicCone benefits from
a robust initialisation such as the one provided by a pre-trained PoincaréEmbed. Consequently,
we utilised the same hyperparameters to train HyperbolicCone except that we initialised it with
the weights from our pre-trained PoincaréEmbed. As outlined in the main paper, we selected
the optimal pre-trained PoincaréGloVe model reported by [32] (50×2D with an initial trick) as a
baseline for our transfer evaluation.

C
Further Discussion on LHIT

Loss Variants As discussed in the main paper, we opted for the triplet contrastive loss format for
hierarchy re-training because hierarchically related entities (e.g., subsumptions) should be closer
together, yet not equivalent. We tested other forms of loss, including standard contrastive loss, which
minimises absolute hyperbolic distances between related entities, and softmax contrastive loss, which

was adopted in training PoincaréEmbed [12]. Our trial experiments demonstrated that the triplet
form converges more efficiently and effectively compared to these alternatives.

Loss Margins We provide an ablation study on loss margins α and β defined in Equation (3) and
Equation (4), respectively.

The results from Table 6 indicate that although loss margins impact performance, the HIT model
exhibits robustness to their variations. Notably, a higher F-score for α = 5.0, β = 0.5 is observed,
surpassing the results presented in the main paper. Despite this, we chose not to overly optimise α
and β to avoid overfitting and to maintain the generalisability of our findings.

Results on SNOMED CT

In the main paper, we primarily focused on models trained on the WordNet (Noun). This section
broadens our study to encompass models trained on SNOMED CT [15], a structured, comprehensive,
and widely-used vocabulary for electronic health records. Using the tool provided by the SNOMED
CT team,16 we converted the latest version of SNOMED CT (released in December 2023) into the
OWL ontology format. We then constructed the hierarchy according to the procedure detailed in
Appendix A.

For entity name pre-processing in SNOMED CT, we addressed potential information leakage during
testing. Typically, an SNOMED CT entity is named in the format of “⟨entity name⟩(⟨branch name⟩)”,
e.g., “virus (organism)”. The branch name denotes the top ancestor and is propagated through all its
descendants. To prevent this information from biasing the model, we removed the branch name from
each entity.

In Table 7, we present relevant statistics of the SNOMED CT hierarchy and its corresponding dataset,
which was constructed using the method outlined in Section 4.2.

Table 8 details the Mixed-hop Prediction results on SNOMED CT, along with the Transfer Mixed-hop
Prediction results on Schema.org, FoodOn, and DOID for pre-trained LMs and models trained on
SNOMED CT. Building on the demonstrated effectiveness of HIT in simulating transitive inference
from the main body of this paper, we present only the results for inductive subsumption prediction.
The transfer evaluation incorporates the same set of hierarchies as those used in the evaluation on
WordNet (Noun), facilitating a meaningful comparison of model performance across different training
hierarchies.

In the Mixed-hop Prediction task on SNOMED CT, all models–pre-trained, fine-tuned, and hierarchy
re-trained–outperform their counterparts on WordNet (Noun) in terms of F-scores. This improved
performance is likely to be attributed to SNOMED CT’s more precise entity naming and better
organised concept hierarchy, which reduces both textual and structural ambiguity.

In the transfer results, models trained on SNOMED CT exhibit notably better F-scores on DOID,
which aligns with expectations given DOID’s focus on diseases and SNOMED CT’s comprehensive
biomedical scope. Conversely, their performance on Schema.org, a common-sense ontology, is
comparatively worse. Notably, the fine-tuned all-MiniLM-L12-v2 performs even worse than its

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the abstract and introduction, we mentioned that our research addresses the
gap of explicit hierarchical understanding in current transformer encoder-based language
models (LMs). We introduce a hierarchy re-training approach utilising a curvature-adaptive
Poincaré ball, enabling these models as hierarchy encoders that can generalise from asserted
subsumptions to inferred and unseen ones with notable performance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed two limitations at the end of the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

16


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work is based on the theoretical guarantee of embedding tree-like struc-
tures in hyperbolic space, which has been proven in other works cited in the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the main paper, we have detailed our methodology in Section 3 and the
baseline models in Section 4. Also, we have listed all necessary experiment settings in
Appendix B. We believe that these details are sufficient for reproducibility.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in

17


---Page Break---
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See footnote 1 on the first page.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/pu
blic/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We followed the evaluation framework of existing literature in hyperbolic
embedding.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

18


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix B, we have mentioned what GPUs we were using for our experi-
ments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This work only utilises fully open-source datasets and models, ensuring there
are no ethical, privacy, or copyright concerns associated with their use.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

19


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have included citations of existing assets where appropriate.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

20


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The use of the dataset is clearly presented in the main paper. We have included
an anonymised link to our dataset and the relevant code is included in the supplimentary
material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification:

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

21


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
