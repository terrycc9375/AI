Abstract

The fundamental goal of deep multi-view clustering is to achieve preferable task
performance through inter-view cooperation. Although numerous DMVC ap-
proaches have been proposed, the collaboration role of individual views have not
been well investigated in existing literature. Moreover, how to further enhance
view cooperation for better fusion still needs to be explored. In this paper, we
firstly consider DMVC as an unsupervised cooperative game where each view can
be regarded as a participant. Then, we introduce the Shapley value and propose a
novel MVC framework termed Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view
Clustering (SCE-MVC), which evaluates view cooperation with game theory. Spe-
cially, we employ the optimal transport distance between fused cluster distributions
and single view component as the utility function for computing shapley values.
Afterwards, we apply shapley values to assess the contribution of each view and
utilize these contributions to promote view cooperation. Comprehensive experi-
mental results well support the effectiveness of our framework adopting to existing
DMVC frameworks, demonstrating the importance and necessity of enhancing the
cooperation among views.

Introduction

Recently, multi-view clustering has become one of the most prominent problems in unsupervised
learning[1, 2, 3, 4]. It leverages data from different views, combining them to provide richer
information for clustering tasks. Generally speaking, multi-view clustering can be broadly categorized
into traditional methods [5, 6, 7, 8] and deep multi-view clustering (DMVC) [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19] methods. Compared to the limited feature extraction capabilities of traditional
methods, deep multi-view clustering methods better preserve information from different views
through flexible deep neural networks. For most DMVC methods, the key challenge is how to
enhance cooperation among views to accomplish better clustering performance[20].

Numerous DMVC algorithms have already achieved significant results in downstream clustering
tasks. However, there has been little research on investigating the the contribution of each view in
the fusion stage. Once evaluating the view contribution, we may observe the phenomenon: One
view dominates the fusion process, suppressing the collaborative contribution of other views, leading
to suboptimal clustering results. We attribute this phenomenon to insufficient cooperation between
views, and thus propose a fundamental assumption: More balanced contributions and more extensive
cooperation among multiple views can lead to better clustering results, as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Performance evaluation of view cooperation contribution and fusion ACC on (a) Caltech101-
7 (b) UCI-digit. As can be seen, our proposed SCE framework clearly promotes inter-view cooperation
and achieves more satisfactory performance.

To this end, we consider introducing the concept of game theory into multi-view clustering and
propose the Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing (SCE) method. Shapley value[21, 22] is a concept
used to measure the contribution of participants in game theory[23, 24]. It utilizes a utility function
to evaluate the different marginal contributions that each participant brings when combined with
other participants, and calculates their contribution to the overall cooperation by taking the weighted
average over all possible combinations of participants[21]. Upon quantifying the contribution of
each view, the cooperation among views can be analyzed based on their respective contributions.
By employing a module that enhances view cooperation, we can dynamically adjust the parameter
convergence rate of views during training in accordance with their contributions. This enables the
underrepresented views to receive a more balanced training regimen, thereby enhancing post-fusion
performance[25].

The primary contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

• Our work is the first framework to evaluate the view contributions within an unsupervised con-
text. Leveraging the proposed View Contribution Evaluation Module, we theoretically quantify the
individual contributions of views.

• We propose the View Cooperation Enhancing Module based on the view contributions obtained by
the View Contribution Evaluation Module, allowing suppressed views to effectively participate in the
fusion process, ultimately enhancing clustering performance.

• Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to showcase the versatility of our SCE framework,
which can effectively evaluate the contributions of views across various MVC frameworks.

Deep Multi-view Clustering

In deep multi-view clustering[26, 27, 28, 29], deep neural networks[30, 31] with multiple nonlinear
transformations are more effective at acquiring feature representations than traditional shallow
models. Presently, deep multi-view clustering methods fall into three main categories[32, 33]: joint
methods[34, 35, 36], alignment-based methods[14, 37, 38, 39], and other methods[40, 41, 42]. Joint
methods consider differences and complementarities among views, optimizing sample representations
within each view’s space. For example, the DMJC[35] utilizes autoencoders to generate view
representations, refining them as pseudo-labels for self-supervised optimization. Alignment-based
methods focus on consistency between views, mapping representations into a shared subspace. These
methods often employ contrastive learning, such as ProImp[43], which integrates contrastive learning

---Page Break---
at both sample and prototype levels. Some approaches combine joint and alignment-based methods,
like the share-specific method[40], which separates sample representations into shared and specific
components, aligns shared representations into a common space, and refines specific representations
in separate spaces.

2.2
Rethinking of Cooperation in DMVC

The core concept of DMVC is to enhance clustering performance by fostering enhanced cooper-
ation and utilizing complementary information across views. Although existing DMVC research
emphasizes leveraging inter-view cooperation for improved clustering tasks, there is currently a lack
of research quantifying the contribution of views during the fusion stage to enhance cooperation.
Multi views[20] and multi modalities[44] are two closely intertwined domains. Within the realm
of multimodal fusion, studies have surfaced highlighting the issue of subpar collaboration among
modalities, prompting endeavors to alleviate the imbalance in modality cooperation. Wang et al. [45]
uncovered varying convergence rates among diverse modalities, leading to a scenario where jointly
trained multimodal models struggle to match or outperform their unimodal counterparts. Furthermore,
Peng et al. [25] demonstrated that in the context of audio-visual learning, superior performance in
the audio modality hampers the optimization of the video modality.

Drawing inspiration from prior studies, our research aims to evaluate the individual contributions of
each view in multi-view clustering fusion. Nevertheless, evaluating view contribution based solely
on labels in unsupervised environments is infeasible. Moreover, employing weights as a measure
for view contribution may not align with all DMVC structures, especially those based on contrastive
learning frameworks. Consequently, quantifying view contributions in fusion and fostering their
cooperation pose significant research challenges.

2.3
Shapley Value: a Method for Evaluating Contribution.

In order to reasonably and effectively evaluate the contributions of each view in the fusion process,
we refer to the theoretical framework of game theory. The Shapley value [46] within game theory
proves instrumental in quantifying participants’ contributions to cooperative coalitions. Denote
X = {xi}n
i=1 as the alliances of n participants. For a participant xi, the Shapley value considers xi’s
contribution in every set that includes him. Let Si = {S ⊆X|xi ∈S} represent the set of all subsets
of X that include the participant xi, then, the overall contribution of member xi, i.e., the Shapley
value, can be expressed as

Shapleyi =
X

s∈Si

(|s| −1)!(n −|s|)!

n!
[v(s) −v(s\{i})],
(1)

where |s| signifies the cardinality of set s; v(·) represents the utility function; [υ(s) −υ(s\{i})]
quantifies the marginal contribution of xi to set s; and (|s|−1)!(n−|s|)!

n!
denotes the weight assigned to
this marginal contribution, determined by the probability of set s occurring.

Given the advantageous characteristics of Shapley values—efficiency, symmetry, dummy, and ad-
ditivity—researchers have increasingly employed them for explaining machine learning models.
For instance, Lundberg et al. [47] proposed a method to interpret predictions by computing feature
importance based on Shapley values. Hu et al. [48] applied Shapley values to evaluate modality
contributions in supervised tasks, while Wei et al. [49] explored modality assessment using Shapley
values. However, these studies focus mainly on supervised scenarios, making the definition of utility
functions for Shapley values in unsupervised settings a challenging task yet to be resolved.

Problem Statement

Given a multi-view dataset X = {X(1), X(2), ..., X(V )} , where V is the number of views, and
X(v)(v = 1, 2, ..., V ) denotes the original feature space of the v-th view. Consider the clustering
problem on the dataset, each cluster is represented by a clustering center µ(v)
j , j = 1, ..., K, where
K is the number of clusters. To achieve better clustering performance, we map the original fea-
ture space X(v) to a latent embedded feature space Z(v) through a non-linear mapping function

View Contribution Evaluation Module

Modified Shapley Value for Multi Views

To assess the contributions of each view in MVC tasks, we treat each view as a player and introduce
the Shapley value referring to Eq. (1). Let X = {X(i)}V
i=1 be the set of all views, Sv = {S ⊆
X|X(v) ∈S} represent the set of all subsets of X that include the v-th view X(v). Define an internal
metric of clustering E independently of labels to serve as a utility function, which will be elaborated
on in the next subsection. Then the Shapley value of the v-th view can be calculated as

Shapleyv =
X

s∈Sv

(|s| −1)!(V −|s|)!

V !

h
E(s) −E(s\{X(v)})
i
,
(2)

where |s| denotes the number of views in the view-set s.

Utility Function in Shapley Value

In Shapley value, the utility function is used to evaluate the benefit created by a coalition. In
DMVC, where each view acts as a participant, the utility function needs to be designed to reflect the
contribution of any combination of views in fusion, without the need for label assistance. In this
scenario, we constructed a novel function E using the following method.

Inspired by the DEC model [50], we assume that the data from each view follows a Student’s t-
distribution. Following the approach outlined by [51], we utilize the t-distribution as a kernel function
to evaluate the distance between the sample embeddings zi and the cluster centers µj within a view:

qij =
(1 + ∥zi −µj∥2/α)−α+1

2
P

j′(1 + ∥zi −µj′∥2/α)−α+1

2 ,
(3)

where α represents the degrees of freedom in the t-distribution. qij denotes the probability of
assigning the feature zi to the cluster center µj.

4


---Page Break---
Fix the degrees of freedom α to 1, the cluster distribution of multi-view data q can be considered as a
combination of single-view cluster distribution based on a weight matrix π:

qij =

P

v π(v)
j
(1 + ∥z(v)
i
−µ(v)
j ∥2)−1
P
j′
P
v′ π(v′)
j′
(1 + ∥z(v′)
i
−µ(v′)
j′ ∥2)−1 ,
(4)

where the weight matrix π ∈RK×V represents the importance of the cluster centers µj in different
views. This weight matrix π can be obtained by performing row normalization on an unconstrained
trainable matrix W:

π(v)
j
=
eW(v)
j
PV
i=1eW(i)
j
.
(5)

For any given combination of an m-view union U = {X(u1), X(u2), ..., X(um)}, we can obtain the
weight matrix πU by selecting the corresponding columns in the matrix W. By applying Eq. (3), we
derive the data distribution for the fused view, which is denoted as qU.

In particular, if U = ∅, which means no view is involved in the clustering process, we consider q∅
to be a uniform distribution. This means that the probability of any embedding zi belonging to any
cluster µj is equal and given by 1/K, where K is the total cluster numbers. In this case, we denote
the resulting data distribution q∅as

q∅= 1

K 1N×K,
(6)

where 1N×K ∈RN×K is a matrix in which all elements are equal to 1.

According to the principle of self-distillation in DEC, we sharpen the fused distribution qX from all
views to obtain a more powerful target distribution p:

pij = (qX
ij)2/
X

j
(qX
ij)2.
(7)

Since we consider the distribution p as the trend of the fusion process, the closer the fusion distri-
bution qU (combined with U = {X(u1), X(u2), ..., X(um)}) is to the distribution p, the higher the
participation of view set U in the fusion process. Therefore, we can use the optimal transport distance
from distribution qU to distribution p as a measure of confidence for distribution qU. Additionally,
based on our desire for the metric to possess monotonicity and boundedness, we define the utility
function based on distribution transportation as:

E(U) =
1
1 + OT(p, qU),
(8)

where OT(·, ·) is calculated as wasserstein distance and E(·) ∈(0, 1]. The closer the data distribution
is to the pseudo-labels p, the larger the value of the metric E(·).

In the process of computing the optimal transport OT(·, ·), we consider the distribution q as a
probability set where K cluster centers are assigned by N samples. The probability of each cluster
center is 1/K. For example, when calculating OT(q{X(1)}, q{X(2)}), the distribution of views can
be represented as [1/K, 1/K, ..., 1/K]T , and the distance matrix {Dij}K×K can be calculated as

Dij =∥ξ(1)
i
−ξ(2)
j
∥2
2,
(9)

where the j-th cluster center for the v-th view can be represented as ξ(v)
j
= {q(v)
ij }N×1.

Shapley-based View Contribution: a Formal Representation

In the above subsections, we have already discussed the integration of cooperative game theory with
multi-view clustering tasks. We have also defined a utility function E that reflects the accuracy
of clustering. Now, combining the Eq. (2) and (8), we present the formal representation of view-
contribution through Shapley values:

Shapleyv =
X

s∈Sv

|s −1|!(V −|s|)!

V !


1
1 + OT(p, qs) −
1
1 + OT(p, qs\{X(v)})


.
(10)

5


---Page Break---
The sum of all view contributions is then calculated as:
X

v
Shapleyv =
1
1 + OT(p, qX ) −
1
1 + OT(p, q∅).
(11)

As p and qX evolve throughout training, the sum of Shapley values for all views also fluctuate
accordingly. To obtain the contribution proportions of each view to the fused view, let

φv =
Shapleyv
PV
i=1 Shapleyi
,
(12)

where φv is the normalized Shapley value, determining the respective contribution of different views.

3.3
Theoretical Analysis

To further demonstrate the generalization performance of the View Contribution Evaluation Module,
we apply it to the alignment-based method and the joint method, respectively. The relevant theoretical
derivations are given below.

Theorem 1: For alignment-based methods, considering the representation {z(1)

(14)

where N is the sample number and τ > 0 is a scalar temperature hyperparameter. ℓcon(1, 2) brings the
representations between views closer, leads to the average of view contributions, i.e., |ϕ1 −ϕ2| →0.

Theorem 2: For joint methods, considering the representation Z(1) = f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)) and Z(2) =

f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)) on two views, with a simple view-level weight fusion during the fusion process:
Z = w1Z(1) + w2Z(2). There are situations where view 2 is dominated by view 1 and cannot make
its contribution, i.e., w1 ≫w2.

Remark: Theorem 1 indicates that alignment-based methods tend to align the contributions of
different views. Under our assumption, the cooperation between views is already sufficient, optimizing
the model based on contributions can only lead to limited improvements. Theorem 2 suggests that in
joint methods, one view may suppress another, highlighting insufficient cooperation between views.
In such cases, enhancing cooperation between views theoretically improves model performance.
We will elaborate on the View Cooperation Enhancing Module in Section 3.4 and validate these
conclusions through experiments. The proofs for Theorems 1 and 2 can be found in Appendix.

3.4
View Cooperation Enhancing Module

After acquiring contributions of different views, we seek to enhance their cooperation by dynamically
regulating views’ training speeds according to these contributions. This proportional control guaran-
tees active involvement of all views in the integration process. For this purpose, we introduce the
convergence speed ratio, labeled as k, derived from the contributions of each view.

To ensure the applicability of our Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing(SCE) method to most
multi-view clustering tasks, we consider a typical multi-view clustering framework: firstly, obtain
embeddings for each view by utilizing autoencoders; then, fuse the embeddings from different views
using a global optimization goal. Let f (v)
θ(v)(X(v); θ(v)) represent the encoder model for the v-th view,
g denote the fusion method for multiple views, and l represent the loss function for computing the
fusion loss. The overall fusion loss L can be represented as

L(θt) = l(g(f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)
t ), f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)
t ), ..., f (V )
θ(V )(X(V ); θ(V )
t
))).
(15)

6


---Page Break---
In practice, the parameters for the v-th view is updated as

θ(v)
t+1 = θ(v)
t
−η∇θ(v)L(θ(v)
t
).
(16)

With the normalized Shapley values calculated by Eq. (12) to dynamically monitor the contribution
differences between different views, we are able to adaptively modulate the gradients via an empirical
formula:
kv = eτ(φmin/φv−1),
(17)
where τ is a temperature hyperparameter to control the degree of modulation. Thus kv is not greater
than 1, and the larger the contribution of the view, the smaller the kv. We integrate the coefficient ki
into the Adam optimization method, and the update of θ(v)
t+1 at iteration t is as follows:

θ(v)
t+1 = θ(v)
t
−kv · η ∂l

∂g · ∂g

∂fv
· ∂fv
∂θ(v)
t
,
(18)

where kv is used as a relative convergence speed ratio for the v-th view in gradient descent.

Theorem 3: For joint methods that use view-level weight fusion Z = w1Z(1) + w2Z(2), where
Z(1) = f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)) and Z(2) = f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)), gradient modulation in Eq. (18) allows the two
views to contribute more evenly, i.e., w1

w2 →1.

Remark: Theorem 3 indicates that through dynamic gradient adjustments, we can harmonize the
learning progress among different views, attain a more average distribution of contributions, and
enhance the cooperation among views. The proof for Theorem 3 can be found in Appendix.

Implementation

This subsection outlines the implementation of our SCE module, detailed in Algorithm 1. After
obtaining initial cluster center assignments, we iteratively employ the following two modules:

View Contribution Evaluation. First, we calculate the cluster distribution for each individual view as
well as the combined view. Next, we compute an enhanced distribution p. After utilizing the optimal
transport distance between distributions as the utility function, we can calculate view contributions.

View Cooperation Enhancing. We utilize the calculated contribution values to influence the training
process of each view using a convergence ratio k. The larger the contribution value of a view, the less
the convergence ratio k will be. This will coordinate the training process of the views, enabling better
cooperation among views, and allowing them to collaborate more effectively.

Evaluate on Alignment-based Methods(RQ1 & RQ2)

In this section, we apply the SCE methods to two alignment-based MVC methods:

- Utilizing infoNCE as a contrastive loss and employing Kmeans after concatenation.

- Incorporating contrastive learning at both the sample and prototype levels as ProIMP[43].

We applied these two approaches to the CUB and Caltech101-7 datasets, each comprising two views.
Detailed experimental results are presented in the Table 2. The results lead to following conclusions:

Figure 3: (a) View contribution is more balanced with SCE. (b) Fusion performs better with SCE.

• Assessed with the View Contribution Evaluation Module, the contributions of the two views in
alignment-based methods are remarkably similar, validating the assertion of Theorem 1.

• As the contributions of the views tend to equalize, the utilization of the View Cooperation Enhancing
Module approach only yields subtle improvements to the alignment-based methods.

Evaluate then Cooperate on Joint Methods(RQ3 & RQ4)

In this subsection, we apply the SCE model to a joint MVC methods(DMJC[35]). We have carried
out comprehensive experiments on six datasets with varying numbers of views, as depicted in
Table 3 and Fig. 3. In Table 3, we showcase the performance of SCE-MVC in comparison to ten
benchmark methods. Fig. 3 illustrates the ablation study of DMJC with and without SCE. Based on
the aforementioned experimental results, we draw the following conclusions:

• Fig. 3(a) illustrates the changes in view contributions with and without the SCE module across
three datasets. Prior to the use of the SCE module, there is a scenario where certain views dominate
while others are suppressed, a pattern particularly evident in the Caltech101-7 dataset, aligning well
with the conclusions of Theorem 2.

• After introducing the View Contribution Enhancing Module, the contributions of the views become
more balanced, leading to a significant improvement in the model’s performance. Specifically, the
ACC, NMI, and ARI metrics on the Caltech101-7 dataset all witness an increase of over 10 percentage
points, thus validating the conclusion of Theorem 3. More detailed contribution comparison data can
be found in the Appendix.

Sensitive Analysis(RQ5)

In SCE-MVC, the singular hyperparameter τ is essential for fine-tuning the convergence equilibrium
among distinct views according to their contributions. In sensitive analysis, we varied τ within
{0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}, as illustrated in Table 4. As τ increases, the changes in clustering results
metrics become less pronounced, which can be attributed to the characteristics of the exponential
functions in Eq. (17). Specifically, as τ increases, the convergence ratio kv tends to be closer to zero.

Conclusion

This paper explores the roles of views in multi-view clustering through the lens of game theory. We
introduce a novel contribution evaluation module founded on the Shapley value. Our experiments
showcase the adaptability of this module across mainstream MVC frameworks, accurately assessing
each view’s impact. By scrutinizing the functions of diverse views during fusion, we devise a
cooperation enhancing module to bolster cooperation among views. Extensive dataset validations
underscore the effectiveness and robust applicability of our approach and theorems.

where N is the sample number and τ > 0 is a scalar temperature hyperparameter. ℓcon(1, 2) brings the
representations between views closer, leads to the average of view contributions, i.e., |ϕ1 −ϕ2| →0.

Proof: Referring to Definition of Perfect Alignment in [53], we say the two views are perfectly
aligned if z(1)
i
= z(2)
i , i = 1, 2, ..., N. Assuming that with the training of contrastive learning, the
representations of the two views tend to align perfectly. Then, there exists a limiting representation
Z∗such that lim ∥Z1 −Z∗∥= lim ∥Z2 −Z∗∥= 0.

Due to the convergence of sample representations from both views, the centroids and sample dis-
tributions of the views also tend to converge, i.e. lim
µ(1) −µ∗ = lim
µ(2) −µ∗ = 0 and
lim
q{1} −q∗ = lim
q{2} −q∗ = 0, where µ∗and q∗represent the clustering centroids and
sample distributions respectively when the two views are perfectly aligned.

Therefore, the utility function based on distribution transportation tends to converge towards a same
value, namely

E({i}) =
1
1 + OT(p, q∗), i ∈{1, 2}.
(21)

According to the definition of Shapley values, the same utility function values yield the same Shapley
values. Therefore, the normalized Shapley value |ϕ1 −ϕ2| →0.

Proof of Theorem 2

Theorem 2: For joint methods, considering the representation Z(1) = f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)) and Z(2) =

f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)) on two views, with a simple view-level weight fusion during the fusion process:
Z = w1Z(1) + w2Z(2). There are situations where view 2 is dominated by view 1 and cannot make
its contribution, i.e., w1 ≫w2.

Proof: Suppose the representation of the two views:
(
Z(1) = f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)),
Z(2) = f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)),
(22)

and view-level weight fusion is adopted in the fusion process:

Z = w1Z(1) + w2Z(2),
(23)

where w1 and w2 represent the weights of View 1 and View 2 respectively, satisfying w1 + w2 = 1.

(33)

which means in the fusion of views, view 1 takes the lead, while view 2 can only play a limited role.
However, in unsupervised tasks, the clarity of the clustering structure is unrelated to the quality of the
clustering results. Even though the clustering structure of view 2 may not be clear, the clustering
results of view 2 could still be accurate. In this scenario, w1 ≫w2 can be considered that the
cooperation between the two views is suboptimal.

A.3
Proof of Theorem 3

Theorem 3: For joint methods that use view-level weight fusion Z = w1Z(1) + w2Z(2), where
Z(1) = f (1)
θ(1)(X(1); θ(1)) and Z(2) = f (2)
θ(2)(X(2); θ(2)), gradient modulation in Eq. (18) allows the two
views to contribute more evenly, i.e., w1

w2 →1.

Proof: Introducing the suppression factor k (where k < 1) suppresses the convergence speed of the
dominant view’s parameters. In this case, the parameter updates become:

 θ(1) = θ(1) −k · η ∂E

∂θ(1)
θ(2) = θ(2) −η ∂E

∂θ(2)

E = 1

Therefore, the upper bound on the overall loss E is jointly determined by the individual view losses
and the view weights. As both ∥z(1)
j
−µ(1)
kj ∥2
2 and ∥z(2)
j
−µ(2)
kj ∥2
2 can be seen as the Kmeans loss for
a single view, during one iteration, if we suppress the gradient descent for the dominant view (view
1), ∥z(1)
j
−µ(1)
kj ∥2
2 would increase compared to not suppressing it, while ∥z(2)
j
−µ(2)
kj ∥2
2 remains
unaffected. The upper bound on the overall optimization objective shifts, leading to differences in the
single-view parameters and weights at convergence.

As the loss converges, the ratio of weights between the two views, w1

w2 →1. This implies that the
weight of the non-dominant view increases, allowing it to more fully engage in the fusion process.
Consequently, there is improved cooperation between the views, enhancing the fusion process.

Further Experiments

B.1
View Contribution Comparison w/o SCE

In this subsection, we conducted additional ablation experiments on the SCE module based on the
DMJC method across six datasets. Table 5 illustrates the variations in view contributions before and
after using SCE. The experimental findings further corroborate our conclusions:

• There are cases where certain views in some datasets do not effectively contribute, such as the 2-nd
view of Caltech101-7, the 2-nd view of CUB, the 3-rd and 4-th views of STL10, and the 5-th view of
Reuters, all with contributions below 0.1.

• Through the SCE method, the contributions of suppressed views experienced significant growth,
with the contribution of the 2-nd view of Caltech101-7 increasing from 0.032 to 0.433, and the
contribution of the 5-th view of Reuters increasing from 0.107 to 0.232.

Table 6, we illustrate the ACC of all views, single view, and paired views after training through three
views of UCI-digit. Before we used the view cooperation enhancing module, the fusion results of
View1 and View3 were superior to those of all views, although the ACC of View3 as a single view
was worst amongst all. Therefore, we consider that views have shortcomings in cooperation. View1
dominates the fusion process, resulting in View2 and View3 not playing a better role. To this end, we
used the view cooperation enhancing module to enhance the contributions of View2 and View3.

Furthermore, we compared the results in Table 7 when only two views participated in training.
Although the fusion of View1 and View3 showed superior performance when three views participated
in training, when training with only View1 and View3, the performance of fusion is significantly
lower than that of training with three views. Besides, the fusion performance of paired views is
not as good as that of three views, proving that each view in the dataset can play a positive role in
cooperation, and this effect can be further expanded by enhancing cooperation.

B.3
Experiments on Additional Datasets

In this subsection, we conducted experiments on three additional datasets with two views:
WikipediaArticles[54], SCENE15[55], and NoisyMNIST8. The detailed information about the
datasets is shown in Table 8. Considering the scale of the NoisyMNIST dataset, all experiments were
conducted on PyTorch platform using the NVIDIA 3090 GPU. The experimental results on these
three datasets are presented in Table 9. The experimental results confirm our proposed theory and
demonstrate the validity of our View Contribution Evaluation Module as well as the effectiveness of
our View Cooperation Enhancing Module.

Limitations and Future Work

In this section, we discussed the limitations of the SCE model and potential future work:

• On some extreme datasets, certain view contributions obtained by the View Contribution Evaluation
Module may be negative, which contradicts the non-negativity definition of Shapley values. A

---Page Break---
negative Shapley value indicates that the corresponding view has performed poorly in the fusion
process, raising the question of whether these views should be discarded, which could be a potential
area of future research.

• The View Cooperation Enhancing Module narrows the contributions between views through
gradient modulation, but it cannot extend the contributions between views. Whether there exists a
more flexible method to control the contribution relationship between views is an intriguing question.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the abstract and introduction sections.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: Please see the Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The code has been open access.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the Section 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The paper does not report error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

22


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
