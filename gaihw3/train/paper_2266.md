Abstract

Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced
criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the
backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations
have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algo-
rithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and
learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biologi-
cal systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible
framework for credit assignment in neural networks. This framework employs
a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process
targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propa-
gation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the
feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network
and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to
target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations. Exper-
imental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets
using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that
CCL achieves comparable performance to other biologically plausible algorithms
while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we
showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its
potential for unsupervised representation learning. Our work presents a direction
for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering an alternative
mechanisms of learning and adaptation in neural networks. 1

Introduction

In deep learning, biological plausibility refers to the properties that deep learning algorithms could
respect to avoid inconsistency with current understandings of neural circuitry or violation of funda-
mental physical constraints, such as the localized nature of synaptic plasticity [Grossberg, 1987, Crick,
1989]. Consequently, error backpropagation (BP), despite its wide application, has been frequently
criticized for its lack of biological plausibility, particularly for the following three challenges: (a)
The weight transport problem, which arises because BP requires the feedback pathway to use the
same set of weights as the feedforward process, a mechanism not observed in biological systems
[Burbank and Kreiman, 2012, Bengio et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016]. (b) The non-local credit
assignment problem arises because backpropagation relies on the global error signal to update the
synaptic weights throughout the network, instead of depending on local errors derived from local loss

computation.2. (c) The backward locking problem occurs because, in BP, each data sample must await
the completion of both forward and backward computations of the previous sample, impeding online
learning capabilities [Jaderberg et al., 2017, Czarnecki et al., 2017]. These limitations have propelled
the development of alternative credit assignment methods that aim to better align with biological
principles and address these significant issues [Lillicrap et al., 2016, Crafton et al., 2019, Launay
et al., 2020, Nøkland, 2016, Bengio, 2014, Lee et al., 2015, Ororbia and Mali, 2019, Meulemans
et al., 2020, 2021, Dellaferrera and Kreiman, 2022, Shibuya et al., 2023].

Reaching Biological Plausibility With a Dual Network Structure. To address the weight transport
problem, we leverage a dual network architecture for processing feedback signals, which uses a
different set of weights from the forward network. To tackle the non-local credit assignment issue, we
use pairwise local loss, computing the difference in layerwise activations between the feedforward
and feedback networks, and ensuring the local loss only updates local weight parameters through
gradient detaching. We approach the backward-locking problem by preventing the feedback network
from reusing latent activations and output signals from the feedforward networks. Since the feedback
network operates independently of the output (prediction), the forward and feedback processes can
occur simultaneously. These enhancements make our approach not only more biologically plausible
but also potentially more effective in complex scenarios.

Analogy to Biological Counter-Current Mechanism. Our scheme draws inspiration from nature’s
counter-current exchange mechanisms, observed in fish gills, animal vessels, and renal systems. These
physiological mechanisms use an anti-parallel structure to optimize resource or energy exchange
between two flows. Similarly, our dual network learning scheme allows the input signals in the
forward network, flowing from input space to target space, to receive target domain information
from the target-to-source signal flow (in the feedback network) and reciprocally share their source
information. Therefore, we name our learning scheme "counter-current learning," as this reciprocal
exchange mirrors the efficiency and optimization seen in biological systems.

Contributions. This paper aims to introduce counter-current learning as a novel, biologically
plausible alternative. We validate our approach through experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 using MLP or CNN architectures. Additionally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in autoencoder-based tasks, which, to our knowledge, represents the first
application of biologically plausible algorithms in this area. Our approach addresses key challenges,
including weight transposition and non-local credit assignment, and partially mitigates the backward
locking, providing a promising avenue for advancing biological plausibility.

Literature Review

Target Propagation: Addressing Biological Plausibility. The target propagation (TP) family [Ben-
gio, 2014] and its variants (e.g., local target representations) [Ororbia et al., 2018, 2023], first
explored in the late 1980s [Le Cun, 1986, Le Cun and Fogelman-Soulié, 1987], have been developed
to optimize the neural networks by using locally generated error signals. TP explicitly constructs
local targets for each layer using a separate feedback network. Take difference target propagation
(DTP) Lee et al. [2015] for example, an idealized global target signal is computed based on the
labels and the prediction error at the output layer. Then, the local idealized targets are generated
by (1) propagating the idealized global targets through the feedback network and (2) computing
a linear correction using the activations from the forward network. Subsequently, local losses are
computed by comparing the layer activations with their corresponding local targets. The weights of
both the forward and feedback networks are updated based on these local losses. Notable variants
such as Direct Difference Target Propagation (DDTP) [Meulemans et al., 2020], Local-Difference
Reconstruction Loss (L-DRL) [Ernoult et al., 2022], and Fixed-Weight Target Propagation Shibuya
et al. [2023] further refine this approach by introducing mechanisms to improve feedback weight
training and enhance the accuracy of local error signals. Despite these advancements, TP methods
still encounter the backward locking issue, since TP methods depend on the forward network’s
outputs and intermediate activations to compute targets. Moreover, recent iterations of TP algorithms,
such as DDTP and L-DRL, can be computationally expensive. They require additional feedback

2In biological systems, synaptic plasticity is believed to be governed by local learning rules, such as Hebbian
learning, where synaptic changes depend on the correlated activity of the pre-and post-synaptic neurons [Dan
and Poo, 2004, Bartunov et al., 2018, Whittington and Bogacz, 2019]

Counter-Current Learning

Figure 1: Overview of the Counter-Current Learning Framework: (a) At initialization, the
counter-current learning framework establishes a dual network structure, with a forward network
that maps the input to the target output, and a complementary feedback network that mirrors the
forward network’s architecture but propagates information in the opposite direction. The framework
leverages the data processing inequality (DPI) from information theory, which states that information
content cannot be increased through signal processing. Consequently, in both networks, information
content decreases from the lower to the upper layers. (b) During training, the losses are computed
in a layer-wise manner, i.e., by calculating the difference of activations from corresponding layer
pairs between the forward and feedback networks, allowing the networks to learn from each other’s
complementary information. Notably, the dependency of the gradient on earlier layer parameters is
interrupted using the gradient detachment operator.

weight update loop per data batch, leading to a three to six-fold increase in training time compared to
traditional backpropagation [Meulemans et al., 2020, Ernoult et al., 2022, Shibuya et al., 2023].

Other Efforts in Enhancing Biological Plausibility. In addition to TP, several other methods
have been proposed to overcome the biological implausibility of traditional backpropagation. The
feedback alignment (FA) [Lillicrap et al., 2016, Nøkland, 2016, Crafton et al., 2019, Launay et al.,
2020, Refinetti et al., 2021] family uses random feedback weights, instead of the transpose of the
weight in the feedforward layer, to approximate the error gradient, thereby eliminating the need for
precise synaptic symmetry. To resolve the backward locking problem, direct random target projection
(DRTP) [Frenkel et al., 2021] proposed to randomly project the target signals to each layer as ideal
targets. While achieving biological plausibility, DRTP encounters a significant performance drop
concerning BP compared to FA algorithms Frenkel et al. [2021], Dellaferrera and Kreiman [2022].
Block-local learning (BLL) Kappel et al. [2023] explores block-wise target signal propagation;
however, the algorithm requires backpropagation to update layers in the same block. Please refer to
Section 6.5 for more literature review.

Counter-Current Learning Framework

In this section, we present the counter-current learning (CCL) framework, as shown in Figure 1,
focusing on its formulation and key components.

Setup and Feedforward Network. Consider input space X and output space Y, each with dimensions
d0 and dL, respectively. The objective is to learn a mapping F : X →Y that minimizes the
discrepancy between the predicted output and the target. We adopt an L-layered feed-forward
neural network with activation function σ. Let gl(·) denote the operation at layer l, and define
Ffw = gL ◦gL−1 ◦. . . ◦g1. Each gl is parameterized by weights Ul. The output of layer l is
al = gl(al−1) = σ(Ulal−1), where a0 = x.

Feedback Network. The proposed learning scheme introduces a complementary backward function
Ffw that mirrors Ffw in an anti-parallel manner. Fbw comprises layers [hL, . . . , h1], with each hl
parameterized by weights Vl. We define Fbw = h1 ◦. . .◦hL. The output of layer l is bl−1 = hl(bl) =
σ(Vlbl), with bL = y. The dimensions of hidden layers align between Ffw and Fbw.

Figure 2: Code Snippet For Counter-Current Learning With Dual Network Architecture.

Stop Gradient Operation. To address the backward locking problem and ensure local synaptic
learning, we use the SG() operation to decouple activations from weights in previous layers, disrupting
the long error-backpropagation chain into local update segments. The SG() can be implemented
using PyTorch gradient detach operation easily. In CCL, each layer’s input is processed with the
SG() operation. To avoid confusion, we use the hat symbol to denote the exact activations in the CCL
paradigm. Specifically, for 1 ≤l ≤L:

ˆal = ˆgl(ˆal−1) = σ(UlSG(ˆal−1)),
ˆbl−1 = ˆhl(ˆbl) = σ(VlSG(ˆbl)),
(1)

where ˆa0 = x and ˆbL = y.

Loss Objective Function. The objective of the counter-current learning algorithm is to minimize
the difference between activations of Ffw and Fbw across all layers but the output layer. To avoid
trivial solutions where activations converge to zero, we first reshape the activations into vectors and
normalize them along the feature dimension using norm(). This normalization ensures meaningful
alignment between forward and feedback passes :

∥norm(ˆal)norm(ˆbl)⊤−I∥,
(2)

where θ = {U1, . . . , UL−1, V1, . . . , VL} are learnable parameters, and I is the identity matrix. For
the output layer (l = L), we use a different objective: the weight matrix UL is trained to minimize
the cross-entropy loss between the network outputs ˆaL and the one-hot encoded labels ˆbL = y.

Biological Plausibility. We examine the biological plausibility of the proposed counter current
learning scheme. This framework mitigates the weight transport problem by using a different weight
parameterization for the feedback network. For the non-local credit assignment problem, the update
of the parameters is driven by local loss, instead of the back-propagated global error signals. Finally,
we partially address the backward update problem by removing the dependency of the backward
network and the forward network with careful gradient detachment.

Implementation. In Figure 2, we present a code snippet for the CCL algorithm in PyTorch, tailored
for an MNIST classification. It shows the independence of the forward process and the feedback

backward propagation, respectively. These functions accept an additional Boolean input, detach,
allowing for the quick toggling between non-local (i.e., BP) and local learning (i.e., CCL) modes.
For loss computation, the train_CCL_step function calculates the loss for counter-current learning.
Conversely, the train_BP_step function computes the loss for error backpropagation.

Experiments

4.1
Counter Current Learning Facilitates Dual Network Feature Alignment

To investigate the alignment of latent features within the counter-current learning framework, we
visualized embeddings from the penultimate layer of the forward network and the corresponding
second layer of the feedback network at various stages of training. We employ a six-layer neural net
trained on MNIST and analyze embeddings from both networks. t-SNE was applied independently to
these embeddings at each training iteration to effectively visualize the evolution of feature spaces.

As illustrated in Figure 3, the embeddings from the forward model trained on MNIST data are
represented by colored dots, while the embeddings from the backward model related to one-hot
encoded labels are denoted by outlined squares of the same color. Throughout the training process,
embeddings from the same class progressively align between the forward and backward models,
suggesting that the forward and backward models mutually guide each other’s feature representations
toward a coherent and discriminative structure. Please refer to Appendix 6.3 for visualization of
feature alignment of more layers and Appendix 6.4 for experiments on weight alignement between
forward and backward layers.

4.2
Classification Performance

Task Setup. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method against several biologically plau-
sible algorithms, including direct target propagation (DTP), DTP with difference reconstruction loss
(DRL), local difference reconstruction loss (L-DRL), and fixed-weight difference target propagation
(FW-DTP). The evaluation is conducted on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
All experiments are performed using stochastic gradient descent optimization with 100 epochs. We
use cross-validation over 5 different random seeds and report the testing performance. The models
are implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework, and the code is available in the Supple-
mentary Material. For the experiments on multi-layer perceptrons, we apply image normalization
as a preprocessing step. For the convolutional neural network experiments, we use additional data
augmentation techniques, including cropping and horizontal flipping. For the counter-current learning
(CCL) algorithm, we search across different learning rates and gradient norm clipping values to find
the optimal hyperparameters following cross-validation, as detailed in Appendix 6.1.

network with 4 layers, each containing 1,024 units. We use the hyperbolic tangent activation function
for BP and TP variant algorithms, while CCL adopts an ELU activation function. The results for
MLPs are shown in Table 1, which demonstrates that the CCL obtains comparable results to error
backpropagation and bears consistency with other biologically plausible algorithms.

Convolutional Neural Network. We also evaluate CCL on convolutional neural networks (CNN)
consisting of five convolutional layers (each with a kernel size of 3 and a max-pooling operation
with a kernel size of 2) followed by a linear classifier, tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. As
shown in Table 3, our CCL-based model performs comparably to, or slightly inferiorly than, the
BP-based model. Additionally, we visualize the kernels in the first convolutional layer to inspect the
learned representations in Figure 4, demonstrating that CCL enables the model to learn meaningful
convolutional kernels without using error backpropagation. Furthermore, we compare our CNN results
on CIFAR-10 with those of L-DRL Ernoult et al. [2022] in Appendix 6.2, while FW-DTP Shibuya
et al. [2023] does not include CNN implementations.

4.3
Auto-Encoder Performance

We explore the applicability of the counter-current learning (CCL) algorithm to autoencoders.

Auto-Encoder on STL-10 Dataset. A convolutional autoencoder with a four-layer encoder and a four-
layer decoder is used. Different from the classification tasks, this architecture replaces the 2x2 kernel
max-pooling with convolution layers with a stride of 2. Batch normalization is applied following each
linear projection and before activation functions to ensure both stability and optimal performance. The
hidden layers of the network are structured with dimensions of [128, 256, 1024, 2048]. Orthogonal
weight initialization is used for training stability. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping and horizontal flipping are incorporated. Hyperparameters including gradient clipping,
learning rate, momentum, and weight decay are subjected to grid search, while cross-validation across
five different seeds is employed to assess the reconstruction L2 loss.

Results. The test set’s reconstruction metric—mean square error—is quantified as 0.0059 ± 0.0001
for BP and 0.0086 ± 0.0001 for CCL. The outcomes, illustrated in Figure 5, underscore the models’

proficiency on the test set. While both BP and CCL adeptly capture the general image structure,
occasional artifact introduction, such as blurring, is observed in CCL compared to BP. This suggests
that while CCL augments certain facets of autoencoder training, further refinement or architectural
adjustments may be imperative to minimize visual artifacts and enhance detail preservation.

4.4
Empirical Analysis of Learning Dynamics for Counter-Current Learning

In this section, we provide insights into the functioning of the proposed Counter-Current Learning
(CCL) algorithm by examining the representation similarity between the forward and feedback
networks. We start by analyzing the feature similarity between randomly initialized feedforward and
feedback models. Following this, we focus on the feature alignment in the high-level feature regime.
Our investigation reveals the emergence of a reciprocal learning structure, where the top layers of
both networks benefit from the bottom layers of each other during training.

We trained a model on the MNIST classification task using a configuration of five convolutional
layers topped with a linear classification head. The training was conducted over 160 steps with a
batch size of 32, achieving an average testing accuracy of 88.88%. To measure the cross-network
representational similarity, we utilized Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) Kornblith et al. [2019],
a metric known for its robustness to invertible linear transformations. This was applied to evaluate
layer and architecture similarity. The results, obtained using five different seeds, are presented as
averaged CKA values on the test set. Figure 6 displays the horizontal axis marking the activations of
forward layers, ranging from the input MNIST images to the logits (i.e., a6), whereas the vertical
axis denotes the activations of the feedback network starting from one-hot labels (i.e., target).

Observation 1: Initialization Shows Noisy Top Layers and Misalignment Between Networks.
At initialization, our premise that the bottom layers contain more relevant information is validated.
The initial CKA (t = 0, top-left subplot in Figure 6) reveals low similarity between the a6 column
(i.e., the top layer of the forward network) and the feedback network. Similarly, the b0 row (i.e., the
top layer of the feedback network) shows low CKA values with the forward layers, confirming our
hypothesis of feature misalignment at random initialization.

Observation 2: Alignment of High-Level Features During Training. As training progresses,
high-level features (i.e., the top layers of the forward network and the bottom layers of the feedback
network) begin to show increasing CKA values (Figure 6, t = 20 to t = 160, top row). This trend
suggests that the forward and feedback networks gradually align their high-level representations.

Observation 3: Emergence of a Counter-Current Reciprocal Structure. The dynamics of the
counter-current learning algorithm reveal significant changes in CKA, particularly at higher layers
(illustrated in the bottom subplots of Figure 6). Notably, the increases are concentrated in the a4, a5,
a6 columns of the forward network and the b0, b1, b2 rows of the feedback network. This pattern
supports the counter-current intuition that top layers benefit from the more informative bottom layers,
fostering a reciprocal learning structure that guides each network’s optimization process using the
most informative features available.

This empirical analysis underscores the hypothesis that the counter-current learning scheme effectively
leverages complementary and reciprocal alignment of representations between the forward and
feedback networks. By exploiting the informative features from the bottom layers of one network
to refine the noisy features in the top layers of the other, the counter-current signal propagation
algorithm achieves a biologically plausible and efficient learning mechanism.

4.5
Ablation on Asymmetric Learning Rates for Dual Network Optimization

We delve deeper into the effects of varying learning rates between forward and feedback networks in
CCL. As illustrated in Figure 7, our experiments confirm that asymmetric learning rates in forward and
feedback networks facilitate effective and robust learning. Particularly noteworthy is our observation
that robust learning outcomes are achievable even when the feedback network operates under a fixed
random setting—specifically, with a zero learning rate (refer to the bottom rows of the figure). This
suggests that the random projection of target labels by the feedback network conveys meaningful
target domain information, echoing findings from the DRTP [Frenkel et al., 2021]. Moreover, our
experiments indicate superior performance compared to the DRTP approach (refer to Table 1),
possibly hinting that a random, non-linear neural network projection (i.e., CCL with a feedback

(Bottom) Changes in CKA between consecutive training steps (i.e., from step t to step t + 1) reveal
significant increases in the top layers of both networks, consistent with our counter-current learning

Figure 7: Learning With Asymmetric Learning Rates in the Networks. We investigate the
influence of asymmetric learning rate in the forward and backward MLPs. This study demonstrates
that effective learning can occur with asymmetric learning rates, even when the feedback network has
a fixed random configuration (i.e., the learning rate for the feedback net is zero).

learning rate of zero) is more beneficial than a mere random linear projection (i.e., DRTP) of labels.
This could be due to the neural network’s ability to maintain and leverage more inductive biases,
which can be crucial for the hierarchical learning processes.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced the counter-current learning framework, a novel approach addressing
the critical limitations of traditional error backpropagation. Our dual network architecture enables a

dynamic and reciprocal interaction between feedforward and feedback pathways, supporting local
learning and effectively resolving the backward locking problem. Our learning framework is validated
across a diverse set of datasets including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10,
and in autoencoder tasks, demonstrates comparable performance with existing learning methods
without compromising learning speed. This underscores the potential of our model to efficiently
handle complex neural tasks and highlights its suitability for broader applications.

Limitations and Future Directions. We acknowledge several limitations that can guide future
research in this field. Firstly, there is a need for further theoretical insights into the counter-current
learning scheme, focusing on its learning dynamics, stability analysis, and inductive biases. Secondly,
continuous exploration of this dual model architecture is essential, such as integrating residual
connections or self-attention modules. Thirdly, hardware acceleration to streamline forward-feedback
computation through parallelization could potentially reduce computation time and yield improved
results within the same time frame. Lastly, exploring the integration of counter-current learning with
other biologically plausible alternatives holds promise for advancing research in this domain.

6.1
Experimental Setup

Hyperparameter Search. For experiments with MLP architectures, we conduct hyperparameter
searches for each algorithm. We run all the combinations of the hyperparameters with 5 different ran-
dom seeds and then select the hyperparameter set with the highest accuracies (or lowest loss for auto-
encoder task) evaluated on the validation set and test on the testing set. For DTP, DRL, L-DRL, and
FWDTP, we search across forward learning rates [0.3, 1, 3], step sizes [0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1],
and backward learning rates [0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01]. Note that FWDTP-BN does not
have the backward learning rate hyperparameter. For DRTP, the search space includes learning rates
[0.010.030.10.3] and mean ([0.0.05]) and standard deviation ([0.010.030.10.3]) for random project
matrix. For BP and FA, we use learning rates [0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01] for hyperparameter
search. and gradient clip values of [0.5, 1]. For CCL, the search space includes learning rates
[0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2] and gradient clip values of [0.5, 1].

Implementation Details. Training MLP and CNN models with CCL can be unstable initially since
both the forward and feedback networks are randomly initialized. We use learning rate warm-up for
the initial 200 steps for CCL, which is adopted in Ernoult et al. [2022]. Moreover, unlike algorithms
in the target propagation family [Meulemans et al., 2020, Ernoult et al., 2022], where the feedback
network weights are trained using additional for-loops to tune the weights for each data batch, we
introduce some techniques to stabilize the training course. We found that normalizing the activations
during loss computation helps stabilize the training process. Additionally, as counter-current learning
can also suffer from feature collapse, where a trivial solution to all pairwise losses is to produce
constant activations, we introduce a remedy. Inspired by layer-wise training, for each latent activation
X ∈Rb×d, where b stands for batch size and d stands for feature dimension, we added an additional
L2 loss to minimize the difference between norm(X)norm(X)⊤and the identity matrix. Finally, in
contrast to error backpropagation, where the error signals can be zero and the weight updates can be
small at the end of training, the layer-wise losses in CCL are seldom zero, thus the weights can keep
changing during the training. This can lead to worse minima. To accommodate this, we use gradient
centralization [Yong et al., 2020] to centralize the gradient for parameters for both BP and CCL
and flooding method [Ishida et al., 2020] to prevent some weights from updating if the sample-wise
difference between output and target is smaller than 0.2 in CCL on CNN.

6.2
Comparison of Implementation

Comparison with Ernoult et al. [2022]. We compare the results on CIFAR-10 using a VGG-like
network architecture. As shown in Table 4, the results indicate that L-DRL [Ernoult et al., 2022]
achieved similar testing accuracies to BP, reaching 89%. While these results are promising, it’s worth
noting some aspects of their methodology that may affect direct comparisons: (1) Their models were
trained on the full training set, which differs from our approach; (2) The authors do not provide
details on the hyperparameter search space or the implementation of cross-validation.

Table 4: Comparison of Results on CIFAR10 Using VGG-like Convolutional Neural Network. ∗

Comparison with Shibuya et al. [2023]. There are some quantitative differences in the results
between ours and Shibuya et al. [2023]. Here, we identify the sources that can potentially lead to
different empirical results:

13


---Page Break---
• We note that the original implementation normalizes FMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 using
the mean and standard deviation of MNIST. We fix this by using each dataset’s mean and standard
deviation;
• We proceed with performing a hyperparameter grid search again using five random seeds because
directly using the paper’s best hyperparameters does not fit. We consider a slightly smaller
hyperparameter search set than the original one, as shown in Section 6.1, due to the computation
and time budget for the grid search of all the combinations.

6.3
Visualization of Representations in Other Layers

To show that the feature alignment can present in more than one layer, we show the results of a
five-layered CNN model trained on CIFAR10. The model is trained for 3000 steps using CCL, and
the t-SNE for layers 1, 3, and 5 with different time steps are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Feature Alignments Across Layers. We show that a similar feature alignment organiza-
tion are observed in the third and fifth layer. While feature alignment in the first layer is inapparent.

6.4
Experiments on Weight Alignment

To better understand how CCL learns, we wonder if CCL learns by aligning the forward and backward
weight. We compute the cosine similarity between the forward layer weights and the corresponding
feedback layer weights for the model trained on MNIST using a five-layered MLP architecture.

As shown in Figure 9, our findings reveal two distinct phases during training:

• Phase one: Layers 1 and 5 show rapid alignment increases.
• Phase two: Alignments in layers 1 and 5 saturate. Alignments in the intermediate layers gradually
increase until saturation.

Interestingly, intermediate layers showed a bottom-up convergence pattern, with layer 2 achieving
highest similarity first, followed by layers 3 and 4. We found that high alignment isn’t always achieved
or necessary for effective learning. This may be due to (1) Dimensional reduction: Information
propagation through the network affects alignment, and (2) Non-linearity: Activation functions
impact the relationship between forward and backward weights. These factors may contribute to
observed alignment patterns without requiring perfect symmetry between forward and backward
weights.

6.5
Literature Reviews on More Biologically Plausible Algorithms

Algorithms with only forward passes. Forward-forward algorithm (FFA) [Hinton, 2022] only
uses forward passes to update the neural network. Specifically, in the supervised learning scheme,

14


---Page Break---
Figure 9: Weight Alignment Between the Forward and the Backward Network Trained With
CCL. We find that the weight alignment of the first and the last quickly achieve plateau, while that of
the intermediate layers increase gradually.

FFA sends the supervision signals with a recurrent architecture in a top-down manner, i.e., propagating
the signal one layer by one layer for 3 - 5 steps. In contrast, our CCL scheme seeks to propagate
the signal directly, thus attaining more computational efficiency. Similarly, Error-driven Input
Modulation (PEPITA) [Dellaferrera and Kreiman, 2022] adopts two forward passes for updating the
neural network, but the second forward pass requires a perturbed input, obtained via adding the input
with the global error signals. Thus, PEPITA causes the update locking problem, and the neurons have
to track two forward activities for loss computation, making it less biologically plausible. SoftHebb
improves upon several state-of-the-art biologically plausible algorithms by achieving non-local
property, mitigating time-locking of layer updates, and operating in an unsupervised manner. While
SoftHebb and CCL perform similarly on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, SoftHebb requires an
extensive layer-wise hyperparameter search (24 hyperparameters). Additionally, SoftHebb’s potential
for auto-encoding tasks remains unexplored.

Algorithms for spiking neurons. BurstCNN [Greedy et al., 2022] and BurstProp [Payeur et al.,
2021] propose to learn spiking neural networks using a two-compartment neuronal model. This
model incorporates unique dendritic properties, synaptic plasticity, and high-frequency bursting,
enabling information multiplexing across hierarchical levels. While these approaches offer high
biological plausibility and attain good performance, extensions to auto-encoding tasks are lacking,
and the required computation times are not provided.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] The claim is supported by our extensive experiments using MLPs and CNNs.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in
the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contribu-
tions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to
this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are
not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] We discuss thoroughly the limitation and future work in the conclusion section

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the
paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to vi-
olations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to
provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by review-
ers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms
that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not
penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

16


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear
in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to
provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] We specify the hyperparameter search space and use five random seeds for all
main experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by
the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code
and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might
suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary
to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide
access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish
this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the
results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a
model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of
the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either
be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model
(e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [Yes] The data is publicly available and the code is included in supplement.
Guidelines:

17


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including
code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.
cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state
which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions
(if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper)
is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [Yes] We use the default train-test split, specify the hyperparameter search space
and use cross-validation to choose them, and use vanilla SGD with momentum.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that
is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] Mean with standard deviation are shown.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).

18


---Page Break---
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the
experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] We reveal the running time for different algorithms.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experi-
mental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it
into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [Yes] Anonymity is ensured.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration
due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA] This paper is about a new learning scheme, as an alternative to back propaga-
tion. The algorithm itself does not have societal impacts.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out
that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes
for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm
for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes
faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or
unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms
for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time,
improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release
of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image
generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere
to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly
respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [Yes] The asset is cited and its original link is shown. The authors do not specify
their license on Github.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service
of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated
licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [Yes] Please check the README.md in the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create
an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as
details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of
the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the
main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or
an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were
obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may
be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should
clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines
for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
