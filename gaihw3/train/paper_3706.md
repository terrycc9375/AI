Abstract

As the key component in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the ability
of the visual encoder greatly affects MLLM’s understanding on diverse image
content. Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as vision
encoders in CLIP and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found
that there is still no single vision encoder that can dominate various image content
understanding, e.g., the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results on general
image understanding but poor performance on document or chart content. To
alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior
of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful
and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with
a coarse-to-fine mechanism. In the coarse-grained stage, we design a context-
aware expert routing strategy to dynamically select the most suitable vision experts
according to the user instruction, input image, and expertise of vision experts.
This benefits from the powerful model function understanding ability of the large
language model (LLM). In the fine-grained stage, we elaborately conduct the
mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-Adapter) to extract and fuse task-specific
knowledge from various experts. This coarse-to-fine paradigm effectively leverages
representations from experts based on multimodal context and model expertise,
further enhancing the generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without any bells and
whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance gains over current state-of-
the-art methods in a wide range of challenging multimodal benchmarks. Codes
and models are available at https://github.com/TempleX98/MoVA.

Introduction

Significant achievements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have been
witnessed due to their remarkable proficiency in solving open-world tasks. MLLMs acquire visual
perception capacity while inheriting sophisticated reasoning abilities and knowledge from large lan-
guage models (LLMs) [8, 9, 10]. The core idea behind MLLMs is projecting the vision representation
into an LLM through a projector, facilitating a general-purpose multimodal understanding.

General multimodal understanding requires comprehending complex image contexts across various
tasks and scenarios. The CLIP [11] vision encoder, pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs
with a contrastive loss, is widely considered as a flexible and popular choice among the latest
leading MLLMs. However, training data and optimization target of the vision encoder determine its

inconsistent performance across tasks and scenarios, which will bias the generalization of multimodal
large language models. For instance, MLLMs with a single CLIP vision encoder usually perform
poorly on fine-grained tasks such as grounding and optical character recognition (OCR) [12]. Several
works have attempted to incorporate extra state-of-the-art vision encoder experts to cope with the
challenge. For example, both SPHINX [13] and MoF [14] integrate vision self-supervised learning
features of DINOv2 [15] with MLLMs to enhance their visual grounding capabilities. Vary [12]
introduces a new vision encoder expert for improved fine-grained document and chart parsing ability.
Intuitively, it is necessary to explore the utilization of more task-specific vision encoder experts in
MLLMs to promote model generalization across various domains.

We aim to start the exploration through empirical analysis of readily available vision experts. In
particular, we focus on the multimodal capabilities of seven distinct state-of-the-art vision encoders
based on LLaVA-1.5-7B [28]. The results in Table 1 reveal that MLLMs with these task-specific
vision encoders achieve optimal performance in their respective area. Concurrently, we note that the
plain fusion (concatenation) of vision encoder experts adopted in previous works [13] would not bring
consistent improvement compared with the single task-specific vision expert in its proficient task.
The inherent bias of each expert introduces biased information and leads to performance degradation
in the plain fusion paradigm. For example, DINOv2 serves as an expert in visual grounding but
performs poorly at text-oriented tasks. Representation of DINOv2 would be regarded as biased
information in text-related scenarios so incorporating DINOv2 for these tasks would inevitably cause
performance decrease. Consequently, a flexible method of vision encoder ensemble that dynamically
activates and weights context-relevant task-specific vision experts can fully unleash the capacity of
these models while avoiding model bias.

In this paper, we propose MoVA, a powerful MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific
vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism. Inspired by the powerful tool-use capabilities of
LLM [29], the coarse-grained context-aware expert routing aims to employ LLM to select vision
experts with strong relevance to the user’s image and instruction from the expert model pool. Thanks
to the strong generalization ability of LLM, we also can perform model routing for vision experts
in open scenarios. The fine-grained expert fusion facilitates better extraction and integration of
expert representations based on multimodal context. Specifically, the expert knowledge extractor in
the mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-Adapter) will extract diverse task-specific knowledge
from various vision experts through mixture-of-expert (MoE) cross-attention layers. The dynamic
gating network can allocate precise expert-wise soft weights for the integration of extracted task-
specific knowledge. Under the coarse-to-fine paradigm, we provide a flexible and effective manner
of leveraging representation from experts based on multimodal context and model expertise, further
enhancing the model generalization ability. As presented in Table 1, MoVA can preserve the optimal
performance of a single relevant vision encoder by ignoring non-relevant experts on the GQA, POPE,
and REC task. Besides, MoVA can further boost performances via the fine-grained fusion of multiple
relevant vision experts on other tasks.

We conduct comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of
MoVA, including MLLM benchmarks, visual question answering (VQA), visual grounding, and
biomedical understanding. Without any bells and whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance
gains over current state-of-the-art methods.

The contributions of this work are three-fold: (i) By analyzing the performance of individual vision
encoders versus the plain fusion of multiple encoders across various tasks, we reveal that the inherent
bias of each vision encoder can diminish its generalization ability across other irrelevant domains.
(ii) We propose MoVA, a powerful MLLM composed of coarse-grained context-aware expert routing
and fine-grained expert fusion with MoV-Adapter. Based on multimodal context and model expertise,
MoVA fully leverages representation from multiple context-relevant vision experts flexibly while
avoiding biased information of irrelevant experts. (iii) We demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MoVA by elaborate ablation studies. MoVA can achieve significant performance gains
over state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of challenging benchmarks.

Related Work

Multimodal architectures [1, 3, 6, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], optimization paradigm [35, 36], applications [37,
38, 39, 40, 41], and benchmarks [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] have recently achieved remarkable
progress and garnered unprecedented attention within the academic community. Multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) usually leverage the alignment from visual features to the linguistic
feature space to achieve superior vision-language understanding capabilities based on off-the-shelf
LLMs and vision encoders. CLIP vision encoder [11], which is trained in contrastive learning
from billions of diverse image-text pairs [49, 50], is widely used among these works. For example,
LLaVA [3] adopts an MLP projector to align visual tokens from the frozen CLIP vision encoder to
the embedding layer of LLM. However, The representation from CLIP exhibits strong discriminative
abilities in classification and recognition but only has limited performance on downstream tasks
like location and relation understanding [51]. To break through this bottleneck, some works [4, 52]
turn to unlock the CLIP vision encoder and further fine-tune the parameter with training data for
downstream tasks. For instance, Qwen-VL [6] collected massive training data for grounding and
OCR to jointly optimize the CLIP vision encoder and LLM. Recent works propose to involve an
extra frozen vision encoder to enhance the performance of MLLMs. SPHINX [13] is one of the
pioneers, where grounding capabilities have been significantly improved with the assistance of the
DINOv2 [15]. Vary [12] introduces an extra encoder training on large-scale charts and document
data to improve the performance on related downstream tasks.

MoVA Methodology

3.1
Overview

MoVA comprises five key components: (i) a pre-trained large language model (LLM) that generates
accurate responses given the image tokens and instructions; (ii) a base vision encoder; (iii) vision
experts that generate task-specific vision latent features; (iv) mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-
Adapter) that performs fine-grained expert fusion based on the multimodal context.

As illustrated in Figure 1, MoVA consists of two stages: coarse-grained context-ware expert routing
and fine-grained expert fusion with MoV-Adapter. First, our coarse-grained context-ware expert
routing leverages the tool-use capabilities of LLM, routing the most appropriate experts from N
expert candidates via LLM to help the model answer the user’s question. In the second stage, we
turn to enhance the visual representation with a novel MoV-Adapter module in a fine-grained manner.
More specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-expert (MoE) cross-attention layers to extract the task-
specific knowledge of representations from chosen experts. Meanwhile, the dynamic gating network
in MoV-Adapter can allocate soft weights to the extracted knowledge of each expert according to
the input image and instruction. Then the extracted knowledge can be effectively integrated into the
foundational representation of the base vision encoder. Finally, the enhanced visual representation
with instruction tokens is fed to the LLM to generate an accurate response. In Section 3.2 and
Section 3.3, we will focus on our core contributions, the context-aware expert routing strategy, and
the expert fusion with MoV-Adapter. In Section 3.4, we will introduce the training process.

The coarse context-aware expert routing is performed in the first stage to select context-relevant
experts. Next, we adopt the MoV-Adapter to extract and fuse the task-specific knowledge from these
selected experts in a fine-grained manner.

Pretrained Vision Encoders and LLM. The vision encoders in MoVA consist of a base encoder and
multiple task-specific vision encoder experts. We choose the pre-trained CLIP ViT-L-336px as the
base encoder. Our vision experts include several state-of-the-art task-specific encoders: DINOv2, Co-
DETR, SAM, Pix2Struct, Deplot, Vary, and BiomedCLIP. The corresponding expertise is presented
in Table 1. For example, both Pix2Struct and Vary will be used when the user asks the MLLM to
scan the document image. MoVA is flexible and easy to generalize to all decoder-only LLMs. We
mainly consider Vicuna-7B [8], Llama3-8B 3, and Yi-34B [53] as our language models in this work.

3.2
Coarse-grained Context-aware Expert Routing

Pipeline of Context-aware Routing. The context-aware expert routing strategy aims to employ the
impressive tool-use capacity of LLM to select vision experts with strong relevance to the user’s image
and instruction from a model pool. Specifically, we perform the context-aware expert routing in
three steps during inference. First, the input image, user questions, and descriptions of expert models
are converted into appropriate instructions that prompt the MLLM to perform expert selection. An
example of the prompt instruction input and selection output is shown in Table 2. Such a routing
task does not require image details and high-resolution input images, hence we directly downsample
the base encoder’s visual feature to obtain a coarse image embedding (e.g., 144 image tokens). The
downsampled image tokens and instruction tokens are then fed to the LLM as inputs. Finally, the
LLM generates the output text and we parse it to determine which vision expert should be selected
for fine-grained knowledge extraction in the second stage. For instance, as depicted in Table 2, the
LLM directly outputs the option’s letter of DINOv2 and Pix2Struct, thus we only utilize them for the
subsequent extraction. During training, we do not perform context-aware expert routing and replace
the routing outputs with our routing annotations to improve efficiency.

Routing Data Construction. Compared with other MLLMs, MoVA requires additional routing
annotations. We first introduce the formal definition of the data structure for an unambiguous
understanding of the routing data. The data structure for expert routing introduces additional routing
annotation R to the conventional multimodal data (I, Q, A). Here, I represents the image, Q and A
refer to the question-answer pair, and R refers to the expert set which contains the most appropriate
ones to solve this question. Then the construction process for routing data can be formulated as
(I, Q, A) →R, with the primary objective being to derive vision experts that optimally align with
the sample (I, Q, A). Intuitively, the language modeling loss can serve as an effective metric for
evaluating how a data sample aligns with the vision expert. Specifically, we can reuse the LLaVA-1.5-
7B models with various vision encoders presented in Section 1 to perform loss computation. Here, we
denote the model with the base encoder as M0 and the model with j-th expert among N experts as

the language modeling loss {Li,j|j ∈{0, 1, . . . , N}}. The j-th expert is regarded as a useful expert
for the i-th sample only if Li,j < Li,0 and will be added to the routing set Ri. Note that we only
keep up to 3 vision experts to avoid computation costs brought by too many additional experts. All
the routing annotations of our training data are generated offline. We can directly parse and input
these offline results to the subsequent expert fusion component during training.

Routing Data Augmentation. To preserve the expert routing robustness and generalization ability in
open scenarios, we only randomly select 2K samples for training, remove the model name in model
description, and rewrite the model descriptions using ChatGPT [54] for each expert. We also shuffle
the model pool and randomly truncate the model pool during training.

3.3
Fine-grained Expert Fusion with MoV-Adapter

We propose the MoV-Adapter to facilitate fine-grained expert representation extraction and integration
based on multimodal context. As shown in Figure 2, the MoV-Adapter consists of L adapter blocks
and a text encoder. Each block contains an expert knowledge extractor, a dynamic gating network,
and a transformer block. For the i-th block, the input feature is denoted as Xi ∈RC×H×W and we
take the CLIP base encoder feature X ∈RC×H×W as the input feature X1 of the first block. We
use G to indicate the indices of chosen K experts. The expert feature set is {Fj|j ∈G}. The final
output feature of L adapter blocks is XL+1. Additionally, we apply two residual blocks [55] with
an average pooling to XL+1 to obtain a coarser image feature XL+1
out ∈RC× H

2 × W

2 , which is further
connected to the LLM text embedding space by an MLP layer.

Text Encoder. We introduce a pre-trained BERT as the text encoder to extract language context
information from the user’s instruction. We take the [CLS] token from the output of the text encoder
as the text token XT ∈RCT . It is worth noting that all the adapter blocks share the same text token.

Expert Knowledge Extractor. We adopt N cross-attention layers as the expert knowledge extractor
to achieve efficient knowledge extraction. Note that only the expert features {Fj|j ∈G} and their
corresponding cross-attention layers are involved in the extraction. For each selected expert feature
Fj ∈RCj×Hj×Wj, we first align its resolution to Xi with bilinear interpolation:

ˆFj = Interpolate(Fj, H, W).

Dynamic Gating Network. We employ a dynamic gating
network to contribute to a fine-grained knowledge integration
process for the conditional representation {Yi
j|j ∈G}. It is
implemented with the softmax over the logits of an MLP layer,
processing multimodal representation to generate expert-wise
soft weight Pi ∈RK for the output of each cross-attention
layer in the extractor. Specifically, the input to the gating
network is the concatenated vector of a visual token Xi
V ∈RC

and the text token XT ∈RCT . We obtain Xi
V with a global
average pooling operation to Xi. Then we concatenate them
to compute the gating weights and the expert-wise outputs by
computing the weighted sum:

of a self-attention layer and an FFN layer. Taking the fused visual representation ˆXi, its output will
serve as the input feature Xi+1 for the next adapter block.

3.4
Training Paradigm

As shown in Figure 3, the training process of MoVA consists of pretraining and supervised finetuning.

Pretraining. To improve multimodal generalization, we first construct 15M visual instruction samples
across diverse domains as the training data: (i) Image caption data that covers 4M randomly selected
samples from DataComp-1B [56], ShareGPT4V-PT [52], and ALLaVA-4V [57]. (ii) Visual grounding
and localization dataset that encompasses Objects365 [58], RefCOCO [21], VisualGenome [59],
PointQA [60], and Flickr30K [61]. (iii) Chart understanding data that includes MMC-Instruction [62],
Chart2Text [63], DVQA [64], and SciGraphQA [65]. (iv) Text recognition and document parsing data
that covers LLaVAR-PT [66] and 3M English document images from Common Crawl 4. (v) LLaVA-
Med [67] for biomedical image understanding. During the pretraining phase, we only optimize the
MoV-Adapter along with the base vision encoder while preserving the capabilities of the initial large
language model. Meanwhile, we leverage the routing annotations generated via the method proposed
in Section 3.2 to choose experts and ignore representations from irrelevant ones during training.

Supervised Finetuning. We utilize high-quality visual instruction tuning data that build upon
LLaVA-665K [28] for finetuning. Additionally, we integrate several visual question answering

improved world knowledge. Apart from the above instruction tuning data, we convert the selected 2K
routing annotations to instructions and incorporate them into the training data. In the supervised fine-
tuning stage, only task-specific vision experts are frozen and we jointly optimize other components.
The objective of supervised fine-tuning is to align the visual representation and the embedding of
LLM, boosting its visual instruction-following capabilities.

Experiments

4.1
Implementation Details

As mentioned in Section 3.4, our training pipeline consists of two stages. In the pretraining stage, we
use the AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate of 2×10−4, a batch size of 1024, and train
the model for 1 epoch. We jointly finetune the weights of all components except additional vision
experts with a batch size of 128 and an initial learning rate of 2×10−5 during supervised finetuning.
We use 3 transformer blocks (L=3) in the MoV-Adapter and its hidden dimension is 1024, which
is consistent with the base vision encoder CLIP. The input resolution of the base vision encoder is
672×672. Two residual blocks with an average pooling are employed in the MoV-Adapter to reduce
the number of output image tokens from 2304 to 576. For the experiment performed in Table 1,
we follow the default setting of LLaVA-1.5 but incorporate several additional datasets, including
DocVQA [17], ChartQA [18], RefCOCO [21], LLaVA-Med [67], VQA-RAD [76], and SLAKE [22].
More details about vision experts, ablations, and analysis are available in Appendix A.1 and A.3.

MLLM Benchmarks

We empirically analyze the multimodal capacity and generalization ability of MoVA on a wide
range of challenging MLLM benchmarks in Table 3. This comprehensive assessment is conducted
on MME [82], MMBench [16], QBench [83], MathVista [84], MathVerse [85], and POPE [20].
Compared to other open-source MLLMs with similar model complexity, MoVA with Vicuna-7B
achieves the best performance across 7 MLLM benchmarks while offering a more favorable balance
between training efficiency and performance. For instance, MoVA-7B surpasses the recent state-of-
the-art LLaVA-NeXT-7B [81] with a dynamic high resolution design, processing only 20% image
tokens. Furthermore, we adopt Hermes-Yi-34B [86] as the LLM to validate the scaling property of
MoVA. As depicted in Table 3, the performance of MoVA-34B is on par with popular proprietary

can serve as an effective dimension for MLLM model scaling.

4.3
Visual Question Answering

The evaluation results on VQA benchmarks are outlined in Table 4. We divide these benchmarks
into general VQA benchmarks [89, 19, 90] and text-oriented VQA benchmarks [71, 18, 17, 69].
Thanks to the dynamic and efficient task-specific knowledge extraction, MoVA achieves state-of-
the-art performances across diverse VQA benchmarks. For general VQA benchmarks, MoVA-7B
outperforms SPHINX-2k [4] equipped with Vicuna-13B on VQAv2 [89] and GQA by 4.2% and
1.9%, respectively. Besides, MoVA shows its proficiency in text recognition in various scenarios,
encompassing scene text, chart, document, and diagram. For instance, MoVA-7B catches up to the
current state-of-the-art generalist CogAgent [87] with 18 billion parameters on these text-oriented
benchmarks with smaller model size. The MoVA model with 38B parameters even surpasses the well-
established specialist model PALI-X-55B [88] by clear margins. These outstanding performances
demonstrate MoVA’s robust generalization capabilities across diverse domains.

MoVA-7B is on par with the state-of-the-art specialist models that are elaborately designed for
grounding tasks. For example, MoVA-7B achieves a score of 90.22% on RefCOCO+ val, which is
2.46% higher than the score of UNINEXT-H [93]. Our largest model MoVA-34B further pushes the
performance bound of visual grounding on these benchmarks. These impressive results demonstrate
MoVA’s remarkable visual grounding capacity.

Medical Visual Question Answering

This experiment is conducted on popular medical VQA benchmarks VQA-RAD and SLAKE. We
directly leverage the medical VQA evaluation metric adopted by LLaVA-Med. Each sample of
VQA-RAD and SLAKE is observed only once during the training process of MoVA and LLaVA-1.5.
For a fair comparison, we compare MoVA with the LLaVA-Med variant that is finetuned with only 1
epoch on the benchmark. The performance of the LLaVA-Med specialist that is fully finetuned on
downstream tasks is also reported. As presented in Table 6, MoVA-7B consistently yields higher
scores than LLaVA-Med and LLaVA-1.5, exhibiting its medical visual chat ability.

4.6
Ablation Study

Component-wise analysis. As presented in Table 7, we perform an ablation to thoroughly delve into
the effect of each component. First, we try to replace the context-aware routing with random routing.
Without task-relevant vision experts, the performance drops by a large margin, especially on the text-
oriented VQA benchmarks. Removing context-aware routing to leverage all vision experts also leads
to similar results. It proves that both these modifications introduce biased information from irrelevant
vision experts due to the removal of context-aware routing. Then, we ablate the effectiveness of the
MoV-Adapter by replacing it with simple linear layers. The removal of fine-grained expert feature
fusion downgrades performance across all datasets. These results delineate that each component in
MoVA can consistently yield significant gains.

Number of activated experts. In the context-aware routing phase, the number of activated experts
K is dynamic. We compare such a data-dependent design with other variations of constant K in this
experiment. As presented in Table 8, the overall performance of dynamic K consistently outperforms
other models with constant K. This reveals this dynamic implementation can fully exploit the
task-specific knowledge of relevant experts while avoiding the incorporation of biased information.

Criteria for choosing better experts. To reduce the costs, our method only adopts

models with
N various encoders to identify the better vision expert separately. However, we do not explicitly
consider the combination of the chosen vision experts. In this experiment, we compare our method

for routing data construction. Specifically, we set N = 4 and employ a smaller model pool of
DINOv2, Co-DETR, Pix2Struct, and Deplot to reduce training costs. As shown in Table 9, our
method achieves comparable performance while requiring much less models for data construction.

---Page Break---
Expert routing in open scenarios. We develop 105 human-verified testing samples that should be
answered using novel experts for the expert routing task. These novel experts encompass 7 vision
models [94, 72, 95, 92, 96, 55, 97] on various computer vision tasks and each expert corresponds to
15 evaluation samples. We manually check the correctness of the expert routing result. As presented
in Table 10, a lightweight network, such as a MLP classifier fails to generalize to this open-world
setting. Besides, increasing the routing training samples and removing data augmentations also lead
to severe performance degradation. The results demonstrate our coarse-grained context-aware routing
preserves the generalization ability for expert routing in open scenarios.

Adapter Design. In this section, we conduct ablation studies on the design of the MoV-Adapter. As
presented in Table 11, we compared the impact of using 2, 3, and 4 adapter blocks on the model’s
performance. We observed that the baseline with 3 blocks can achieve better performance than other
settings. Then, we substituted our multimodal gating for uniform gating to investigate its effectiveness.
Each of the experts is assigned the same soft weight in the uniform gating. We find uniform gating
brings consistent performance drops in the test benchmarks. It indicates that the lack of the dynamic
soft-weight harms the overall performance since it fails to perform precise knowledge extraction.

Inference Analysis. As illustrated in Figure 1, MoVA consists of two stages: coarse-grained context-
ware expert routing and fine-grained expert fusion with MoV-Adapter. This two-stage inference
pipeline can be further broken down into five steps: (i) Data preprocessing. We first process the
input image with image processors and convert the input text into a token sequence with the LLM
tokenizer. (ii) Base encoder forward. We extract the base image feature using the base CLIP encoder.
Note that we only run the base encoder once since its output feature can be preserved and reused in
the fourth step. (iii) LLM routing generation. We compress the base image features into 144 image
tokens. The LLM generates a concise routing answer based on the compressed image feature and
routing instruction. Vision experts and MoV-Adapter forward. (iv) According to the multimodal
context and routing results generated in the previous step, we fuse vision features of the base encoder
and activated experts in a coarse-to-fine manner. (v) LLM response generation. The LLM generates
the final response given the fused vision features and user instructions. To investigate the inference
efficiency of each step, we randomly select 200 images from the COCO val2017 dataset and adopt
the common image caption instruction: Describe this image. The temperature for generation is 0.
The latency is measured using bfloat16 and flash-attention 2 on an A100 80G GPU. We present the
average inference latency of each step and show the average sequence length of the routing output
and final response. The inference latencies for each step are 0.19s, 0.05s, 0.14s, 0.07s, and 10.24s,
respectively. The average length of the routing output is 3.24 tokens, while the average length of the
final response is 405.06 tokens. Compared to the LLM response generation (Step 5), the LLM expert
routing (Step 3) generates much fewer output tokens and its latency is negligible (0.14s v.s. 10.24s).
Therefore, our method does not bring significant inference costs.

Conclusion

In this paper, we reveal that the inherent bias of each vision encoder can diminish its generalization
ability across other irrelevant domains by analyzing the performance of individual vision encoders
versus the plain fusion of multiple encoders across various tasks. To deal with the problem, we
propose MoVA, a powerful MLLM composed of coarse-grained context-aware expert routing and
fine-grained expert fusion with MoV-Adapter. Based on multimodal context and model expertise,
MoVA fully leverages representation from multiple context-relevant vision encoder experts flexibly
and effectively while avoiding biased information brought by irrelevant experts. MoVA can achieve
significant performance gains over current state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of benchmarks.

Limitations. We acknowledge some limitations in our paper that require attention. One limitation
is the hallucination, which refers to the generation of text that appears plausible or coherent but
is factually incorrect and misleading. This issue potentially presents in all powerful MLLMs.
Additionally, the performance may be affected by failure cases of the context-relevant vision experts,
leading to potential degradation. We plan to explore solutions for these limitations in future works.

Vision Experts

Model Configuration. We present the detailed model configurations of our task-specific vision
experts in 12. We adopt the official checkpoint weights that are publicly available.

Model Description. The model descriptions used in the routing prompt are released in Table 17.

A.2
Training Data Details

The training process of MoVA consists of two stages. In the Appendix, we present the training
datasets with corresponding task templates of the first stage in Table 13. For the training data of the
second stage, we follow the prompt format of LLaVA-1.5 [28]. The MoVA models with Vicuna-7B
and LLama3-8B are pretrained using 64 A100 80G GPUs for 2 days, and finetuned using 32 A100
80G GPUs for 1 day. The MoVA with 34B LLM is pretrained using 128 A100 80G GPUs for 5 days
and finetuned using 64 A100 80G GPUs for 2 days.

More Experiments

Image segmentation. In this experiment, we aim to investigate if task-specific knowledge can
improve MoVA on the segmentation task. Therefore, we introduce a simple design to extend
MoVA to segmentation tasks. Unlike segmentation generalists [98] that adopt an additional pixel
decoder with high-resolution images for high-quality mask generation, we just formulate the referring
segmentation task as sequential polygon generation [99]. We finetune MoVA and the baseline with a
SAM-Huge [24] backbone on the RefCOCO referring segmentation datasets. MoVA achieves 57.1%
gIoU on the testA benchmark, which is 2.6% higher than the 54.5% of baseline. This result indicates
that MoVA is capable of exploiting task-specific knowledge to solve segmentation tasks.

Effect of LLM for expert routing. In this experiment, we investigate the effect of the LLM in our
coarse-grained expert routing. As presented in Table 14, expert routing with LLM achieves the best
performance. When the LLM is substituted for a lightweight MLP classifier and a BERT encoder,
we need to increase the number of routing training samples from 2K to 1.6M to preserve model
performance. Besides, both MLP classifier and BERT encoder fail to perform expert routing in open
scenarios as stated in Table 10. Therefore, the strong tool-use capacity and generalization ability of
LLM is critical to our flexible and effective expert routing.

Vision encoder for expert routing. In the coarse-grained expert routing, we only adopt the image
feature of base vision encoder CLIP. As presented in Table 15, the method with CLIP achieves
slightly better performance than other methods since such a routing task does not require elaborate
expert knowledge. Besides, incorporating other vision experts with plain fusion also brings biased
information and increases cost. To achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we
only use CLIP for coarse-grained expert routing.

Number of image tokens in expert routing. We ablate the number of image tokens used in the expert
routing stage. As shown in Table 16, routing with 144 tokens can achieve comparable performance
to methods with more tokens. Considering the additional cost brought by processing more image
tokens, we only use 144 tokens for routing.

Data construction. In this experiment, we analyze the effectiveness of our routing data construction
method. The test split is constructed by randomly selecting 500 samples from the routing data. We
first prompt GPT4-V [54] to determine whether the expert routing result is reasonable or not. These
evaluation results are then manually checked and we finally compute the routing accuracy using
the human-verified evaluation results. Our loss-driven data construction approach achieves 94.6%
accuracy (473 samples are regarded as “reasonable” by GPT4-V), demonstrating its effectiveness.

Qualitative Results

We apply MoVA to a wide range of real-world understanding and reasoning tasks to investigate its
multimodal comprehension capacity. As presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5, MoVA successfully
solves these diverse and complex cases thanks to the context-relevant expert knowledge.

A.5
Potential Societal Impacts

Positive impacts. The positive impact is to use MoVA to solve various open-world tasks in real-world
scenarios. For example, MoVA can serve as a useful assistant to help people improve work efficiency
and answer their questions.

Negative impacts. The potential negative social impact is to use MoVA model to generate misleading
and false contents. This issue potentially presents in all multimodal large language models. We will
try to improve its safety in future works.

Joke and Meme

User:
Can you explain this meme?

MoVA:

The image is a humorous meme that compares the experiences of different parties involved 
in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The meme is divided into four panels, 
each representing a different entity: Zoom, the Wifi company, the teacher, and the 
students. 
In the first panel, a man is shown throwing money into the air, symbolizing the 
financial success of Zoom, a popular video conferencing platform that has seen a surge 
in usage during the pandemic. The text "Zoom" is written above the image.
The second panel shows a man lying on a couch, holding a laptop, with a relaxed and 
content expression on his face. This represents the teachers who have been able to work 
from home and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The text "Teacher" is written above the 
image.
In the third panel, a man is shown throwing money into the air, similar to the first 
panel, but this time the text "Wifi company" is written above the image. This suggests 
that the companies providing internet services have also benefited from the increased 
demand for online services during the pandemic.
The fourth and final panel shows a clown with a sad expression, standing in front of a 
mirror with the words "PUT ON A HAPPY FACE" written on it. This represents the students 
who have had to adapt to online learning and may be feeling overwhelmed or stressed. The 
text "Students" is written above the image.
Overall, the meme humorously highlights the different experiences and impacts of online 
learning during the pandemic, with Zoom and the Wifi company profiting, teachers 
enjoying a more relaxed lifestyle, and students feeling the pressure to adapt to a new 
learning environment. 

UI Notification Understanding

User:
Imagine that you are a robot operating a computer. Like how humans operate 
the computer, you can move the mouse, click an icon with the mouse, or type 
some texts with the keyboard. 
Below is what you see on the computer screen. Describe the image and predict 
your next move. If the action involves moving the mouse, describe the 
location and the icon as detailed as possible.

MoVA:

This is a screenshot of a computer desktop with various icons and a window 
open. The desktop displays an image of a bridge over a body of water, 
possibly a sea or ocean. The bridge is a long, straight structure connecting 
two land masses. The water is a deep blue, and the land is rocky with some 
greenery. The window also shows some text at the bottom that reads "Kevin Lin 
is calling you," suggesting that someone named Kevin Lin is trying to reach 
the user. The desktop has several icons, including one for the browser, a 
folder, and some other applications. The taskbar at the bottom of the screen 
shows the time as 11:18 AM and the date as 7/21/2023. There are also icons 
for various applications, including a search bar and a folder.

As a robot, I would not have personal preferences or needs, so my next move 
would depend on the instructions given to me. If I were asked to open a new 
tab in the browser, I would click on the browser icon in the taskbar. If I 
were asked to answer the call from Kevin Lin, I would click on the phone icon 
in the notification area of the taskbar. If I were asked to open a specific 
application, I would click on the corresponding icon on the desktop. If I 
were asked to search for something, I would click on the search bar icon in 
the taskbar.

Abstract
As the key component in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the ability of the 
visual encoder greatly affects MLLMs' understanding on diverse image content. 
Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as vision encoders in CLIP 
and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found that there is still no 
single vision encoder that can dominate various image content understanding, e.g., 
the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results on general image understanding 
but poor performance on document or chart content. To alleviate the bias of CLIP 
vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior of different pre-trained 
vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful and novel MLLM, adaptively 
routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism. In 
the coarse-grained stage, we design a context-aware expert routing strategy to 
dynamically select the most suitable vision experts according to the user 
instruction, input image, and expertise of vision experts. This benefits from the 
powerful model function understanding ability of the large language model (LLM). In 
the fine-grained stage, we elaborately conduct the mixture-of-vision-expert adapter 
(MoV-Adapter) to extract and fuse task-specific knowledge from various experts. This 
coarse-to-fine paradigm effectively leverages representations from experts based on 
multimodal context and model expertise, further enhancing the generalization ability. 
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach. Without bells and whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance gains 
over current state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of challenging multimodal 
benchmarks.

Flow Chart Understanding

User:
Can you translate the flowchart to a C++ code?

MoVA:

Sure, here's a possible C++ code that implements the logic of the flowchart:
‘’’
#include <iostream>

int main() {

int num1, num2;
std::cout << "Input num1: ";
std::cin >> num1;
std::cout << "Input num2: "; 
std::cin >> num2; 

if (num1 > num2) {

std::cout << "The larger number is: " << num1 << std::endl;
} else {

std::cout << "The larger number is: " << num2 << std::endl;
}        

return 0;  
}    
‘’’

This code prompts the user to input two numbers, num1 and num2, and then compares 
them using an if-else statement. If num1 is greater than num2, the code will 
display num1; otherwise, it will display num2.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count
towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clarify our main claims and contribution in the abstract and introduction
section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: We discuss the limitations of MoVA in the conclusion section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We fully release the implementation details and experiment settings in the
Section Experiments and Section Appendix.

Guidelines:

24


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The codes and models will be released when the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

---Page Break---
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the experiment details in Section Experiments and Section Ap-
pendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]

Justification: We conduct experiments only once following the previous baseline LLaVA [28].
It would be too computationally expensive to conduct the pretraining and finetuning multiple
times.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We release the experiments compute resources in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

26


---Page Break---
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the potential societal impacts of our work in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

---Page Break---
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Section Experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Section Experiment and supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
