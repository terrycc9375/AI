Abstract

We introduce Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation (R-HPM) in the wild,
where either a text or positional prompt specifies the person of interest in an image.
This new task holds significant potential for human-centric applications such as
assistive robotics and sports analysis. In contrast to previous works, R-HPM (i)
ensures high-quality, identity-aware results corresponding to the referred person,
and (ii) simultaneously predicts human pose and mask for a comprehensive repre-
sentation. To achieve this, we introduce a large-scale dataset named RefHuman,
which substantially extends the MS COCO dataset with additional text and posi-
tional prompt annotations. RefHuman includes over 50,000 annotated instances
in the wild, each equipped with keypoint, mask, and prompt annotations. To en-
able prompt-conditioned estimation, we propose the first end-to-end promptable
approach named UniPHD for R-HPM. UniPHD extracts multimodal representa-
tions and employs a proposed pose-centric hierarchical decoder to process (text
or positional) instance queries and keypoint queries, producing results specific to
the referred person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPHD produces
quality results based on user-friendly prompts and achieves top-tier performance
on RefHuman val and MS COCO val2017.

Introduction

Human pose estimation in the wild is a fundamental yet challenging problem in the vision community,
fueling advancements in various applications like human-AI interaction, activity analysis, video
surveillance, assistive robotics, and sports analysis. This task aims to locate keypoints (joint locations)
of humans within images in unconstrained environments.

Previous multi-person pose estimation techniques typically follow a two-stage paradigm, separating
the problem into person detection and local keypoint regression. These techniques can be summarized
as top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down approaches [9, 15, 63, 79, 84] use a detection
model to identify human bounding boxes and a separate pose estimation model to predict keypoints
on the cropped single-human image. The independent models in these methods lead to a non-end-
to-end pipeline with substantial computational costs. Bottom-up approaches [3, 10, 31, 62] usually
predict keypoint heatmaps to obtain instance-agnostic keypoints and assign them to individuals using
heuristic grouping algorithms. The intricate grouping algorithms in these approaches introduce
hand-designed parameters and face challenges in handling complex scenarios such as occlusions.

With advancements in attention mechanisms [2, 56, 57, 59, 77] and transformer architectures [4, 95],
many recent approaches regard human pose estimation as a direct set prediction problem and design
end-to-end differentiable transformers, leading to notable improvements. They employ bipartite
matching to establish one-to-one instance correspondence for the set of predictions, avoiding the
need for post-processing in the training stage. Among them, PETR [70] proposes a transformer
that progressively predicts keypoint positions through pose and keypoint decoders. QueryPose [85],
ED-Pose [87], and GroupPose [44] further incorporate a human detection stage for instance feature
extraction or query initialization to improve performance and expedite model convergence. They all
use keypoint-level queries to capture local details for accurate pose estimation.

Despite demonstrating favorable performance, these methods still require designed strategies to select
the best match for a target individual during deployment, which can result in suboptimal outcomes
or false negatives, and lack exploration of human-AI interaction to directly predict expected results
based on natural prompts. Additionally, they overlook joint human pose and mask estimation, which
provides comprehensive human representations to facilitate applications like assistive robotics and
sports analysis. For example, accurate joint human pose and mask estimation in unconstrained
environments enables robots to locate, analyze, and interact with target individuals, enhancing user
experience and assistive tasks.

In this paper, we propose the new task of Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation (R-HPM) in
the wild. As illustrated in Figure 1, unlike multi-person pose estimation [3, 15, 24, 66], R-HPM is a
multimodal reasoning task that requires a unified model to predict both pose and mask of a referred
individual using user-friendly text or positional prompts, enabling comprehensive and identity-
aware human representations without post-processing. To achieve this, we introduce RefHuman,
a large-scale dataset that substantially extends MS COCO [40] with additional text, scribble, and
point prompt annotations. Our dataset accommodates diverse task settings to enhance human-AI
interaction. Manually annotating text descriptions and scribbles is expensive. To reduce annotation
costs, we design a human-in-the-loop text generation strategy using powerful large language models
and employ bezier curves to automate scribble generation.

To benchmark R-HPM, we propose an end-to-end promptable approach called UniPHD. Our approach
directly adopts prompts as instance queries and coordinates them with keypoint queries to jointly
predict identity-aware keypoint positions and masks for the target. Unlike previous works [44, 70,
85, 87], UniPHD introduces a pose-centric hierarchical decoder (PHD) that employs deformable and
graph attention to effectively model local details and global dependencies, ensuring target-awareness
and instance coherence. Furthermore, our approach follows a general paradigm that enables seamless
integration with the decoders from recent transformer-based methods such as GroupPose [44] and
ED-Pose [87] for R-HPM. We conduct extensive experiments on the RefHuman dataset. Integrating
our approach with GroupPose and ED-Pose yields promising results in an end-to-end fashion.
Moreover, our UniPHD approach achieves top-tier performance on both RefHuman val and MS
COCO val2017, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and the significance of our task.

Our main contributions are summarized below:

• We propose Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation (R-HPM) in the wild, a new
task that simultaneously predicts the pose and mask of a specified individual using natural,
user-friendly text or positional prompts. This task enhances models with identity-awareness
and produces comprehensive human representations to benefit human-AI interaction.

• We introduce RefHuman, a large-scale dataset that substantially extends COCO for R-HPM.
RefHuman contains pose and mask annotations for individuals in diverse, unconstrained
environments and is enriched with corresponding text and positional prompts.

a solid benchmark for future advancements in this field.

2D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild

Human pose estimation aims to localize keypoints of individuals in unconstrained environments.
For a long period, two-stage approaches have dominated this field, generally divided into top-down
and bottom-up methods. Top-down methods [9, 15, 34, 63, 79, 84] first detect and crop each person
using an object detector, then perform pose estimation on these cropped instance-level images
using a separate model. Although effective, the redundancy from the extra detection step, region
of interest operations, and separate training makes them suboptimal. Bottom-Up methods [3, 10,
31, 62] first detect abundant instance-agnostic keypoints and then group them into individual poses.
While generally efficient, their intricate grouping algorithms pose challenges in handling complex
scenarios, resulting in inferior performance. Furthermore, these two-stage approaches suffer from
non-differentiable, hand-crafted post-processing steps that challenge optimization. Inspired by the
one-stage object detectors [21, 76], pixel-wise regression methods [49, 53, 55, 64, 73, 75, 78, 81, 93]
densely predict pose candidates in an end-to-end fashion and apply Non-maximum Suppression
(NMS) to obtain poses for different individuals. However, these methods produce redundant results,
challenging the removal of duplicates.

Recent human pose estimation methods [51, 52, 72] explore transformer-based architectures [2, 4,
77, 95] due to their sparse, end-to-end design and promising performance. These methods treat
human pose estimation as a direct set prediction problem and use bipartite matching to establish
one-to-one instance correspondence during training. Among these, [70] proposes a transformer with
a pose decoder to predict keypoints and a joint decoder to refine them. [85] performs estimation
on extracted object features to reduce noisy context. [85, 87] incorporate a human detection stage
for query initialization to enhance performance. These methods achieve favorable performance but
require complex strategies to identify the best match for a specified person during deployment due to
the lack of exploration of prompt reasoning. In this work, we propose a multimodal reasoning task
to directly and jointly predict the identity-aware pose and mask for a referred person, resulting in
comprehensive human body representations and facilitating applications in human-AI interaction.

2.2
Referring Image Segmentation

Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to segment target objects in images based on natural
linguistic descriptions [18, 30, 91]. It related tasks include interactive image segmentation [7, 8, 25, 37,
41, 86], which segments targets based on user clicks. Early RIS methods [6, 17, 18, 35, 43, 54, 71, 90]
employ convolution and recurrent neural networks for multimodal encoding and segmentation. Their
intrinsic constraints in capturing long-range dependencies and handling free-form features often
lead to suboptimal performance. To improve multimodal representation and alignment, attention-
based bidirectional [19, 20] and progressive [16, 22, 23, 88, 89] cross-modal interaction modules are
proposed. Additionally, [80, 92] leverage the strong cross-modal alignment capabilities of pre-trained
large language models [67, 69].

With advancements in transformer architectures [4, 61, 77, 95], [11, 13, 29, 38, 42, 45, 58, 60, 83,
94] design end-to-end transformers for language-conditioned segmentation and achieve favorable
performance. In this work, we investigate a unified promptable transformer that effectively processes
both text and positional prompts, thereby broadening its generalizability and application scope.
Moreover, our model coordinates prompts with keypoint queries, enabling the joint prediction of
keypoint positions and segmentation masks for specified individuals.

3.1
Data Annotation

Pioneer works on 2D human pose estimation datasets in RGB images include [5, 12, 14, 26, 28].
Recent efforts focus on human pose estimation ‘in the wild’, establishing datasets such as MPII [1],
MS COCO [40], CrowdPose [33], COCO-WholeBody [27], and AI Challenger [82]. Despite their
prevalence, these datasets lack crucial text and scribble prompt annotations needed for human-AI
interaction. The large-scale RefHuman dataset extends the widely-used MS COCO with additional
text and positional (scribbles and points) prompt annotations, facilitating promptable models to
enhance human-AI interaction.

Text Prompt Annotation. Manually annotating text descriptions is costly. To mitigate this, we
design a human-in-the-loop text generation strategy using the large language model, ChatGPT [65].
As shown in Figure 2 (a), we first provide the entire image with a bounding box indication to GPT-4
to generate a text description [Opt1] with global context. However, large language models often
misidentify targets in complex scenes. To handle this, we crop the image to focus on the target
person and let GPT-4 generate a description [Opt2] with correct local details. Given that individuals
may have similar appearances, descriptions generated based on instance-level images are often not
distinguishable. Therefore, we combine the global and local descriptions, integrating them into a
comprehensive description [Opt3] of the target person. Finally, we manually select and revise these
automatically generated descriptions to create accurate text prompts.

Our strategy successfully generates acceptable descriptions for images with simple scenarios. These
correspond to over 35% of the cases. In the remaining cases, unsatisfactory descriptions are generated.
Common issues include misidentification of individuals, incorrect orientation (e.g., facing left or
right), and indistinguishable context. Nevertheless, these descriptions often provide valuable context,
expediting the annotation process. To further scale up the RefHuman training set, we integrate text
annotations from RefCOCO/+/g [30, 50], doubling the number of referred instances.

Positional Prompt Annotation. Bézier curves are parametric curves based on Bernstein Polynomials
and widely used in computer graphics. In this work, we employ cubic Bézier curves to simulate
scribbles and generate clicks. Given four control points p0, p1, p2, and p3, the cubic Bézier curve
starts at p0 moving toward p1 and reaches p3 from the direction of p2. The general equation for a
Bézier curve c(t, n) of degree n is:

c(t, n) =

n
X

i=0
bi,n(t)pi,
0 ≤t ≤1
(1)

bi,n(t) =
n


(1 −t)n−iti,
i = 0, ..., n
(2)

where bi,n(t) represents the Bernstein basis polynomials and
 n
i

is the binomial coefficient. To
generate scribble prompts, we randomly sample four control points within the foreground mask to
fit a cubic Bézier curve, represented as an ordered set of points {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)}.
The curve is then discretized by uniformly sampling twelve points to form a scribble prompt
s={(x⌊kn

12 ⌋, y⌊kn

12 ⌋) | k = 1, 2, . . . , 12}. For point prompts, we randomly select a single point

p=(x, y) from s, where x and y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates.

Data Statistics

As shown in Table 1, RefHuman includes 50,210 human instances across 21,634 images, larger than
RefCOCO [30], RefCOCO+ [30], and RefCOCOg [50], and with additional positional prompts. To
construct RefHuman train set, we annotate prompts for all humans in MS COCO train2017 set
with at least three surrounding people, a minimum of eight visible keypoints, and an area ratio of at
least 2%. For the RefHuman val set, we annotate humans in MS COCO val2017 set, excluding
those with non-visible keypoints or an area ratio below 1%, as instances below this threshold are
often not visually clear and difficult to describe accurately. Note that each instance may have multiple
text, scribble, and point annotations, with each image-prompt pair treated as a separate sample.

Figure 3: Detailed architecture of our UniPHD, which contains a multimodal encoder that imbues
visual features with prompt awareness and a pose-centric hierarchical decoder that enables prompt-
conditioned queries to effectively capture local details and global dependencies within targets. Our
unified model is end-to-end and accepts text descriptions, scribbles, or points as prompts to predict
the keypoint positions and segmentation mask of the target person.

Given an image I and a text prompt T or positional prompt P, our task aims to simultaneously predict
the keypoint positions K ∈RN×2 and binary segmentation mask M ∈RH×W of the referred person,
where N is the number of keypoints, and H and W are the spatial dimensions. To this end, we
propose a fully end-to-end promptable UniPHD approach, as illustrated in Figure 3. UniPHD consists
of four key components: Backbone, Multimodal Encoder, Pose-centric Hierarchical Decoder, and
Task-specific Prediction Heads. A small set of prompt-conditioned queries is employed to identify

5


---Page Break---
the referred person and estimate results. During inference, we directly output expected predictions
from the highest-scoring query group without any post-processing.

4.1
Backbone

Visual Encoder. We start by using a visual encoder to extract multi-scale visual features and
apply a point-wise convolution to reduce the channel dimension of features to D =256 for efficient
multimodal interactions. Feature maps with downsampling rates of {8, 16, 32, 64} are then flattened
and concatenated into tokenized visual representations Fv. We adopt Swin Transformer [47] as the
visual encoder in this work.

Prompt Encoder. For a linguistic description with L words as a prompt, we use RoBERTa [46]
to extract word-level features Fw ∈RL×D and generate sentence-level feature as the instance
query QI ∈R1×D by pooling Fw. For a discretized scribble or a single point prompt, we retrieve
embeddings directly from visual features at stride 16 based on their positions to obtain pixel-level
prompt features Fw, which are then pooled to form the instance query QI.

4.2
Multimodal Encoder

To generate target-related multimodal representations Fvl, visual tokens Fv are first enhanced through
a modality-specific cross-attention, which integrate information from prompt features:

Fvl = Fv + Attni(Q = Fv, K = Fw, V = Fw)
(3)

where i = 0 for text prompt and i = 1 for positional prompts, i.e., we adopt separate parameters
for cross-modal fusion of different prompt types. After that, we follow previous works [44, 58, 87]
to use a memory-efficient deformable transformer encoder to encode the multimodal features. The
output of the transformer encoder Fvl is then forwarded to the decoder to update queries.

4.3
Pose-centric Hierarchical Decoder

We employ n groups of queries for the referred human and generate n groups of results. Each group
consists of a prompt-conditioned instance query and k learnable keypoint queries. The keypoint
queries regard each keypoint as a target and aim to regress their respective positions, while each
instance query, conditioned on the prompt, predicts a confidence score, dynamic segmentation filters,
and a bounding box to locate the referred human. The scores are supervised by the losses of each
query group to indicate result quality. During deployment, we directly generate results for the target
using the highest-scoring query group without any post-processing.

Prompt-conditioned Query Initialization. We first construct a query group template QIP
Init ∈
R(k+1)×D by concatenating the text/positional prompt embedding QI with k (e.g., 17) randomly
initialized learnable embeddings QP . To generate n query groups, we apply linear layers to the
prompt-aware multimodal features Fvl to identify the top-n highest-scoring positions p and estimate
their corresponding keypoint positions and centers as reference points, denoted as c ∈Rn×(k+1)×2.
The template QIP
Init is then repeated n times and enhanced with reference points c, their associated
positional embeddings, and the top-n highest-scoring multimodal embeddings Fvl
p , to form QIP .
Finally, the instance query in each copy incorporates the prompt embedding and a positional embed-
ding derived from the keypoints center of each candidate for pose-centric decoding. During decoding
process, we employ graph-attention to model global dependencies for each query group, enabling all
queries to utilize the prompt as guidance to identify the referred person only.

Hierarchical Local Context and Global Dependency Modeling. We introduce a pose-centric
hierarchical decoder to effectively model complementary local details and global dependencies
for target-aware decoding. As illustrated in Figure 3, local details are first aggregated using the
efficient deformable attention [95], similar to [44, 58, 87]. Each instance and keypoint query in QIP
independently predicts its sampling offsets and corresponding attention weights on the multimodal
features Fvl. We then aggregate the sampled features accordingly for each query to capture local
details. However, after local detail aggregation, the keypoint queries struggle to perceive the prompt
information and lacks interactions with each other, challenging the target-awareness and instance
coherence. Additionally, the instance query lacks sufficient relevant global context to accurately
locate the referred person at pixel-level.

6


---Page Break---
To address these issues, we model each query group as a bipartite graph G = {V, E, A}, with nodes
V representing different queries and edges E denoting relations between nodes, constrained by a
learnable soft adjacent matrix A ∈R(k+1)×(k+1), which simulates inherent keypoint-to-keypoint,
keypoint-to-instance, and instance-to-keypoint relations. The edge Eij from the i-th node to the j-th
node can be formulated as:
Eij = (W qVi)(W kVj)⊤+ Aij
(4)

where W q and W k are learnable projection matrices. Through our graph attention, both instance
and keypoint queries capture global dependencies of the target and thus ensure instance coherence.
Ultimately, the instance query generates dynamic filters for mask prediction, while the keypoint
queries regress target keypoint positions.

4.4
Task-specific Prediction Heads

As illustrate in Figure 3, four lightweight heads are built on top of the decoded queries to predict
bounding boxes, class scores, masks, and keypoint positions for the target. The box head predicts the
bounding box location of the target to aid the learning process. The class head outputs confidence
scores, supervised by losses from each query group, to indicate the prediction quality of each query
group. The mask head produces dynamic filters for conditional segmentation on the multimodal
features Fvl. The keypoint head predicts keypoint positions and their visibility for the referred person
in images. Detailed training loss functions for these outputs are supplied in the Appendix.

Conditional Segmentation. After extracting semantically-rich multimodal features Fvl, we address
pixel-level target localization using dynamic filters generated by instance queries, which capture both
local details and global dependencies. Similar to [58], we standardize the resolution of the multi-scale
multimodal features Fvl to H/8 × W/8 and combine them into a single feature map Fm through
efficient element-wise addition. We then reshape the prompt-conditioned dynamic filters to form two
point-wise convolutions that apply to Fm to obtain the segmentation mask for the referred person.

Experiments

Metrics. We use standard metrics to evaluate our task. For pose estimation, we adopt OKS-based
average precision (AP) and PCKh at a 0.5 threshold (PCKh@0.5) [1]. For segmentation, we report
mask AP and overall Intersection-over-Union (IoU). The AP metrics are evaluated across all query
groups, consistent with prior works [44, 87], while PCKh@0.5 and oIoU are measured using only
the highest-scoring query group to better reflect real-world deployment.

Implementation Details. We train our model on the RefHuman train, which contains approximately
46K person instances with 17 keypoints per instance, and evaluate on the RefHuman val. We also
evaluate our model on MS COCO by generating positional prompts for all images in the dataset. Due
to the page limit, we leave the further implementation details in the Appendix.

Main Results

In Table 2, we evaluate our models and the recent advances [44, 87] on the RefHuman val set. For
fairness, all models are evaluated with inputs resized to a maximum of 640 pixels on the longer side.

Effectiveness of Our Promptable Paradigm. Recent human pose estimation methods like Group-
Pose [87] and ED-Pose [44] predict poses for multiple humans but require hand engineered selection
strategies to identify the best match for a specified person, which can result in suboptimal outcomes or
false negatives. By integrating their decoders into our end-to-end promptable paradigm, we directly
generate poses and masks in one go for the referred person, achieving up to 73.0 pose AP, 89.6
PCKh@0.5, and 85.6 oIoU with scribble prompts. This performance rivals that of previous models
which use 3× more training data and hand engineered result selection strategies. Intersection-based
result selection is chosen in Table 2 because distance- and IoU-based strategies lead to inferior perfor-
mance, as discussed in the ablation study. Furthermore, our paradigm achieves advanced performance
even with a single point prompt, while previous models struggle with such simple guidance, as the
random positive points/clicks can be near poses of unintended humans in crowds. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our end-to-end promptable paradigm and the significance of our
proposed R-HPM task, i.e., accurate joint pose and mask estimation based on user-friendly prompts.

Effectiveness of Our UniPHD Approach. In Table 2, our UniPHD approach sets a new benchmark
in overall performance for R-HPM through pose-centric hierarchical decoding, outperforming the
nearest competitor, Uni-GroupPose w/ Scribble, by 1.7 Pose AP and 1.0 Mask AP, with comparable
FPS. Intuitively, the interdependent influence of human keypoints makes graph networks suitable for
modeling their dependencies. After applying deformable attention to capture local details, we employ
graph attention with a learnable soft adjacent matrix to simulate keypoint-to-keypoint, keypoint-
to-instance, and instance-to-keypoint relations. This matrix guides edge construction to effectively
model global dependencies and ensure instance-awareness and coherence.

Results for Different Prompts. Table 2 shows that scribble prompts outperform point and text
prompts in R-HPM. Scribble prompts offer more explicit positional guidance, enhancing instance
query robustness. Point prompts, while slightly less accurate, offer greater user convenience in
human-AI interaction due to their single-click simplicity. Text prompts face challenges in multimodal
alignment, especially for crowded scenarios, but provide linguistic flexibility and enable non-physical
interactions. Overall, our unified model effectively handles various prompts, showing great potential
to facilitate human-AI interaction.

Evaluation on MS COCO val2017. We further evaluate UniPHD on MS COCO by aggregating
results from all instances in each image. As shown in Table 3, all models are evaluated using inputs
resized to a maximum of 640 pixels on the longest side for comparison. Trained solely with positional
prompts, UniPHD achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO val2017, even when compared

to competitors using higher-resolution inputs, further demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and
the significance of the proposed task.

Comparison with Text-based Segmentation Methods. To further validate the effectiveness of
UniPHD in segmentation, we compare it with popular open-source text-based segmentation methods
trained on RefHuman, as shown in Table 4. Using only text prompts for training, our model achieves
superior performance compared to competitive methods like SgMg [58] and ReLA [42].

Qualitative Results. In Figure 4, we present qualitative results of UniPHD in various challenging
scenarios such as crowded scenes, occlusions, similar appearances, dim lighting, and viewpoint
changes. UniPHD effectively captures appearance, location, action, and context information to
generate high-quality outputs. More visualizations are supplied in the Appendix.

Ablation Study

Result Selection Strategies. Table 5 shows the performance of a recent human pose estimation
model [44] using various result selection strategies on RefHuman val. Without carefully designed
strategies, the model struggles to accurately predict target individuals. The distance-based strategy
fails to effectively filter out high-scoring irrelevant results, while the intersection-based strategy
delivers the best performance.

Multi-task Learning. In Table 6, we evaluate the impact of multi-task learning in our approach on
RefHuman val using the AP metric. Removing either head adversely affects the performance of the
other. This validates the effectiveness of our decoder, which enables bidirectional information flow
between keypoint and instance queries to enhance both predictions.

Pose-centric Hierarchical Decoder. In Table 7, we analyze the impact of global dependency
modeling in our decoder. Without global dependencies, keypoint queries struggle to perceive the
prompts for predicting target-aware results. Our graph attention clearly outperforms self-attention
because it not only models dynamic node relations but also simulates inherent keypoint-to-keypoint,
keypoint-to-instance, and instance-to-keypoint relations via soft adjacent matrix.

Query Initialization. Similar to recent transformer-based pose estimation methods [44, 87], we use
prompt-conditioned query initialization to enrich queries with dynamic spatial priors. Table 8 reveals
that omitting these dynamic priors results in a performance decrease of 0.4-1.2% AP. Nonetheless,
our model maintains robust performance without query initialization, demonstrating its efficacy.

Training with Extra Data. To unleash the capability of UniPHD for positional prompt-based predic-
tion, we expand our training data beyond RefHuman to encompass the entire MS COCO train2017
images by generating additional point and scribble prompt annotations based on Bézier curves. As
shown in Table 9, UniPHD, trained exclusively with positional prompts on the expanded dataset,
achieves impressive performance on RefHuman val, with up to 94.9 PCKh@0.5 and 89.4 oIoU,
demonstrating its scalability.

Conclusion

We introduced Referring Human Pose and Mask Estimation in the wild, a new task aimed at
simultaneously predicting the poses and masks of specified individuals using natural, user-friendly
text or positional prompts. This task holds significant potential for enhancing human-AI interactions
in fields such as assistive robotics and sports analysis. To achieve this, we introduced the RefHuman
dataset that substantially extends MS COCO with additional text and positional prompt annotations.
We also proposed the first end-to-end promptable approach named UniPHD, which employs pose-
centric hierarchical decoder to model local details and global dependencies for R-HPM. UniPHD
achieves top-tier performance, establishing a solid benchmark for future advancements in this field.
We hope our new task, dataset, and approach could foster advancements in human-AI interaction and
related areas.

Broader Impacts. Malicious use of R-HPM models can bring potential negative societal impacts,
such as unauthorized mass surveillance. We believe that the model itself is neutral with positive
human-centric applications, including assistive robotics and sports analysis.

Limitations. The proposed UniPHD approach produces high-quality results with various prompts.
However, text prompts perform worse than positional prompts due to misidentification. Future
research could enhance vision-language alignment to reduce this performance disparity.

Training Loss Functions

The overall loss function for UniPHD consists of four parts:

Ltrain = Lbox + Lclass + Lpose + Lmask,
(5)

where Lbox is for human box regression that contains L1 loss and GIOU [68] loss, Lclass is for
classification includes focal loss [39] with α = 0.25 and γ = 2, Lpose is for keypoint regression and
visibility prediction that includes L1 loss, the constrained L1 loss-OKS loss [70], and cross entropy
loss, Lmask is for segmentation that includes Dice [36] loss and focal loss. The loss coefficients λL1
box,
λGIOU
box
, λfocal
class , λL1
pose, λOKS
pose , λCE
pose, λDice
mask, λfocal
mask are 5, 2, 2, 10, 4, 4, 5, 2, following [44, 58, 87].
The Hungarian algorithm [32] is used to identify the optimal assignment (query group) with the
highest similarity to the ground truth for training. The class label for the optimal instance query with
the minimum loss from the ground truth is set to one, while all others are set to zero.

A.2
Implementation Details

We follow the common optimization strategies in [44, 58, 83, 87] to train the models. During training,
we augment input images through random flip, random crop, and random resize with the shorter sides
within the range of 360 to 640 pixels and the longer sides up to 640 pixels. For each iteration, we
randomly select either a text or positional prompt with equal probability. We use the AdamW [48]
optimizer with a weight decay of 1×10−4 and train our models on 24GB RTX 3090 GPUs with batch
size 16 for 20 epochs. The initial learning rates are set to 1×10−5 for the visual encoder and 1×10−4
for other components, with a rate decay at the 18th epoch by a factor of 10. Both the multimodal
encoder and pose-centric hierarchical decoder consist of 6 layers, and we use 20 query groups for our
models. During testing, we resize the input images with their longer sides up to 640 pixels.

A.3
Different Query Group Numbers

In Table 10, our approach perform well across different numbers of query groups, measured by the
AP metric. This hyperparameter primarily affects pose estimation, with 20 query groups identifying
more candidates to achieve the best performance.

effective.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the claims, which are supported by
our experimental results. See Abstract and Sec. 1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not contain any theoretical assumptions or proofs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the dataset, model, and training details in Sec. 3, Sec. 4, Sec. 5, and
the Appendix. The introduced dataset and code are publicly available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

19


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The introduced dataset and code are publicly available.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Sec. 5 and the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We follow the usual format used in previous related works to report and
compare the results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

20


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Sec. 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

21


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite the creators or original papers of all the related code, data, and models
used in this paper. All the assets are free for research study and widely used in previous
related works. We also provide the licenses of the used datasets in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

22


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the dataset, model, and training details in Sec. 3, Sec. 4, Sec. 5, and
the Appendix. The introduced dataset and code are publicly available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We did not use crowdsourcing or conduct research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We did not use crowdsourcing or conduct research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
