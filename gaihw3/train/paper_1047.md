Abstract

Conventional wisdom holds that autoregressive models for image generation are
typically accompanied by vector-quantized tokens.
We observe that while a
discrete-valued space can facilitate representing a categorical distribution, it is not
a necessity for autoregressive modeling. In this work, we propose to model the
per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, which allows us to
apply autoregressive models in a continuous-valued space. Rather than using cat-
egorical cross-entropy loss, we define a Diffusion Loss function to model the per-
token probability. This approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokeniz-
ers. We evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of cases, including standard
autoregressive models and generalized masked autoregressive (MAR) variants. By
removing vector quantization, our image generator achieves strong results while
enjoying the speed advantage of sequence modeling. We hope this work will moti-
vate the use of autoregressive generation in other continuous-valued domains and
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/LTH14/mar.

Introduction

Autoregressive models are currently the de facto solution to generative models in natural language
processing [38, 39, 3]. These models predict the next word or token in a sequence based on the
previous words as input. Given the discrete nature of languages, the inputs and outputs of these
models are in a categorical, discrete-valued space. This prevailing approach has led to a widespread
belief that autoregressive models are inherently linked to discrete representations.

As a result, research on generalizing autoregressive models to continuous-valued domains—most
notably, image generation—has intensely focused on discretizing the data [6, 13, 40]. A commonly
adopted strategy is to train a discrete-valued tokenizer on images, which involves a finite vocabulary
obtained by vector quantization (VQ) [51, 41]. Autoregressive models are then operated on the
discrete-valued token space, analogous to their language counterparts.

In this work, we aim to address the following question: Is it necessary for autoregressive models
to be coupled with vector-quantized representations? We note that the autoregressive nature, i.e.,
“predicting next tokens based on previous ones”, is independent of whether the values are discrete
or continuous. What is needed is to model the per-token probability distribution, which can be
measured by a loss function and used to draw samples from. Discrete-valued representations can
be conveniently modeled by a categorical distribution, but it is not conceptually necessary. If al-
ternative models for per-token probability distributions are presented, autoregressive models can be
approached without vector quantization.

With this observation, we propose to model the per-token probability distribution by a diffusion
procedure operating on continuous-valued domains. Our methodology leverages the principles of
diffusion models [45, 24, 33, 10] for representing arbitrary probability distributions. Specifically,
our method autoregressively predicts a vector z for each token, which serves as a conditioning for
a denoising network (e.g., a small MLP). The denoising diffusion procedure enables us to represent
an underlying distribution p(x|z) for the output x (Figure 1). This small denoising network is

fusion network (a small MLP). This offers a way to model

work is trained jointly with the autoregressive model by
backpropagation. At inference time, with a predicted z,
running the reverse diffusion procedure can sample a to-
ken following the distribution: x ∼p(x|z). This method
eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers.

trained jointly with the autoregressive model, with continuous-valued tokens as the input and target.
Conceptually, this small prediction head, applied to each token, behaves like a loss function for
measuring the quality of z. We refer to this loss function as Diffusion Loss.

Our approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. Vector-quantized tokenizers are
difficult to train and are sensitive to gradient approximation strategies [51, 41, 40, 27]. Their recon-
struction quality often falls short compared to continuous-valued counterparts [42]. Our approach
allows autoregressive models to enjoy the benefits of higher-quality, non-quantized tokenizers.

To broaden the scope, we further unify standard autoregressive (AR) models [13] and masked gener-
ative models [4, 29] into a generalized autoregressive framework (Figure 3). Conceptually, masked
generative models predict multiple output tokens simultaneously in a randomized order, while still
maintaining the autoregressive nature of “predicting next tokens based on known ones”. This leads
to a masked autoregressive (MAR) model that can be seamlessly used with Diffusion Loss.

We demonstrate by experiments the effectiveness of Diffusion Loss across a wide variety of cases,
including AR and MAR models. It eliminates the need for vector-quantized tokenizers and consis-
tently improves generation quality. Our loss function can be flexibly applied with different types
of tokenizers. Further, our method enjoys the advantage of the fast speed of sequence models. Our
MAR model with Diffusion Loss can generate at a rate of < 0.3 second per image while achieving
a strong FID of < 2.0 on ImageNet 256×256. Our best model can approach 1.55 FID.

The effectiveness of our method reveals a largely uncharted realm of image generation: modeling
the interdependence of tokens by autoregression, jointly with the per-token distribution by diffusion.
This is in contrast with typical latent diffusion models [42, 37] in which the diffusion process models
the joint distribution of all tokens. Given the effectiveness, speed, and flexibility of our method, we
hope that the Diffusion Loss will advance autoregressive image generation and be generalized to
other domains in future research.

Related Work

Sequence Models for Image Generation. Pioneering efforts on autoregressive image models [17,
50, 49, 36, 7, 6] operate on sequences of pixels. Autoregression can be performed by RNNs [50],
CNNs [49, 7], and, most lately and popularly, Transformers [36, 6]. Motivated by language models,
another series of works [51, 41, 13, 40] model images as discrete-valued tokens. Autoregressive
[13, 40] and masked generative models [4, 29] can operate on the discrete-valued token space. But
discrete tokenizers are difficult to train, which has recently drawn special focus [27, 54, 32].

Related to our work, the recent work on GIVT [48] also focuses on continuous-valued tokens in
sequence models. GIVT and our work both reveal the significance and potential of this direction.
In GIVT, the token distribution is represented by Gaussian mixture models. It uses a pre-defined
number of mixtures, which can limit the types of distributions it can represent. In contrast, our
method leverages the effectiveness of the diffusion process for modeling arbitrary distributions.

Diffusion for Representation Learning. The denoising diffusion process has been explored as a
criterion for visual self-supervised learning. For example, DiffMAE [53] replaces the L2 loss in the
original MAE [21] with a denoising diffusion decoder; DARL [30] trains autoregressive models with
a denoising diffusion patch decoder. These efforts have been focused on representation learning,
rather than image generation. In their scenarios, generating diverse images is not a goal; these
methods have not presented the capability of generating new images from scratch.

Diffusion for Policy Learning. Our work is conceptually related to Diffusion Policy [8] in robotics.
In those scenarios, the distribution of taking an action is formulated as a denoising process on the
robot observations, which can be pixels or latents [8, 34]. In image generation, we can think of
generating a token as an “action” to take. Despite this conceptual connection, the diversity of the
generated samples in robotics is less of a core consideration than it is for image generation.

Method

In a nutshell, our image generation approach is a sequence model operated on a tokenized latent
space [6, 13, 40]. But unlike previous methods that are based on vector-quantized tokenizers (e.g.,
variants of VQ-VAE [51, 13]), we aim to use continuous-valued tokenizers (e.g., [42]). We propose
Diffusion Loss that makes sequence models compatible with continuous-valued tokens.

3.1
Rethinking Discrete-Valued Tokens

To begin with, we revisit the roles of discrete-valued tokens in autoregressive generation models.
Denote as x the ground-truth token to be predicted at the next position. With a discrete tokenizer, x
can be represented as an integer: 0 ≤x < K, with a vocabulary size K. The autoregressive model
produces a continuous-valued D-dim vector z ∈RD, which is then projected by a K-way classifier
matrix W ∈RK×D. Conceptually, this formulation models a categorical probability distribution in
the form of p(x|z) = softmax(Wz).

In the context of generative modeling, this probability distribution must exhibit two essential prop-
erties. (i) A loss function that can measure the difference between the estimated and true distribu-
tions. In the case of categorical distribution, this can be simply done by the cross-entropy loss. (ii) A
sampler that can draw samples from the distribution x ∼p(x|z) at inference time. In the case of cat-
egorical distribution, this is often implemented as drawing a sample from p(x|z) = softmax(Wz/τ),
in which τ is a temperature that controls the diversity of the samples. Sampling from a categorical
distribution can be approached by the Gumbel-max method [18] or inverse transform sampling.

This analysis suggests that discrete-valued tokens are not necessary for autoregressive models. In-
stead, it is the requirement of modeling a distribution that is essential. A discrete-valued token space
implies a categorical distribution, whose loss function and sampler are simple to define. What we
actually need are a loss function and its corresponding sampler for distribution modeling.

3.2
Diffusion Loss

Denoising diffusion models [24] offer an effective framework to model arbitrary distributions. But
unlike common usages of diffusion models for representing the joint distribution of all pixels or all
tokens, in our case, the diffusion model is for representing the distribution for each token.

Consider a continuous-valued vector x ∈Rd, which denotes the ground-truth token to be predicted
at the next position. The autoregressive model produces a vector z ∈RD at this position. Our goal
is to model a probability distribution of x conditioned on z, that is, p(x|z). The loss function and
sampler can be defined following the diffusion models [24, 33, 10], described next.

Loss function. Following [24, 33, 10], the loss function of an underlying probability distribution
p(x|z) can be formulated as a denoising criterion:

L(z, x) = Eε,t
h
∥ε −εθ(xt|t, z)∥2i
.
(1)

Here, ε ∈Rd is a noise vector sampled from N(0, I). The noise-corrupted vector xt is xt =
√¯αtx+√1 −¯αtε, where ¯αt defines a noise schedule [24, 33]. t is a time step of the noise schedule.
The noise estimator εθ, parameterized by θ, is a small MLP network (see Sec. 4). The notation
εθ(xt|t, z) means that this network takes xt as the input, and is conditional on both t and z. As per
[46, 47], Eqn. (1) conceptually behaves like a form of score matching: it is related to a loss function
concerning the score function of p(x|z), that is, ∇logx p(x|z). Diffusion Loss is a parameterized
loss function, in the same vein as the adversarial loss [15] or perceptual loss [56].

It is worth noticing that the conditioning vector z is produced by the autoregressive network: z =
f(·), as we will discuss later. The gradient of z = f(·) is propagated from the loss function in
Eqn. (1). Conceptually, Eqn. (1) defines a loss function for training the network f(·).

We note that the expectation Eε,t[·] in Eqn. (1) is over t, for any given z. As our denoising network
is small, we can sample t multiple times for any given z. This helps improve the utilization of the
loss function, without recomputing z. We sample t by 4 times during training for each image.

Sampler. At inference time, it is required to draw samples from the distribution p(x|z). Sampling

is done via a reverse diffusion procedure [24]: xt−1 =
1
√αt


xt −
1−αt
√1−¯αt εθ(xt|t, z)

+ σtδ. Here

δ is sampled from the Gaussian distribution N(0, I) and σt is the noise level at time step t. Starting
with xT ∼N(0, I), this procedure produces a sample x0 such that x0 ∼p(x|z) [24].

When using categorical distributions (Sec. 3.1), autoregressive models can enjoy the benefit of hav-
ing a temperature τ for controlling sample diversity. In fact, existing literature, in both languages
and images, has shown that temperature plays a critical role in autoregressive generation. It is desired
for the diffusion sampler to offer a temperature counterpart. We adopt the temperature sampling pre-
sented in [10]. Conceptually, with temperature τ, one may want to sample from the (renormalized)
probability of p(x|z)
1
τ , whose score function is 1

τ ∇logx p(x|z). In practice, [10] suggests to either
divide εθ by τ, or scale the noise by τ. We adopt the latter option: we scale σtδ in the sampler by τ.
Intuitively, τ controls the sample diversity by adjusting the noise variance.

3.3
Diffusion Loss for Autoregressive Models

Next, we describe the autoregressive model with Diffusion Loss for image generation. Given a se-
quence of tokens {x1, x2, ..., xn} where the superscript 1 ≤i ≤n specifies an order, autoregressive
models [17, 50, 49, 36, 7, 6] formulate the generation problem as “next token prediction”:

p(x1, ..., xn) =

n
Y

i=1
p(xi | x1, ..., xi−1).
(2)

A network is used to represent the conditional probability p(xi | x1, ..., xi−1). In our case, xi can
be continuous-valued. We can rewrite this formulation in two parts. We first produce a conditioning
vector zi by a network (e.g., Transformer [52]) operating on previous tokens: zi = f(x1, ..., xi−1).
Then, we model the probability of the next token by p(xi|zi). Diffusion Loss in Eqn. (1) can be
applied on p(xi|zi). The gradient is backpropagated to zi for updating the parameters of f(·).

3.4
Unifying Autoregressive and Masked Generative Models

We show that masked generative models, e.g., MaskGIT [4] and MAGE [29], can be generalized
under the broad concept of autoregression, i.e., next token prediction.

Bidirectional attention can perform autoregression. The concept of autoregression is orthogonal
to network architectures: autoregression can be done by RNNs [50], CNNs [49, 7], and Transformers
[38, 36, 6]. When using Transformers, although autoregressive models are popularly implemented
by causal attention, we show that they can also be done by bidirectional attention. See Figure 2.
Note that the goal of autoregression is to predict the next token given the previous tokens; it does not
constrain how the previous tokens communicate with the next token.

We can adopt the bidirectional attention implementation as done in Masked Autoencoder (MAE)
[21]. See Figure 2(b). Specifically, we first apply an MAE-style encoder1 on the known tokens
(with positional embedding [52]). Then we concatenate the encoded sequence with mask tokens
(with positional embedding added again), and map this sequence with an MAE-style decoder. The
positional embedding on the mask tokens can let the decoder know at which positions are to be
predicted. Unlike causal attention, here the loss is computed only on the unknown tokens [21].

With the MAE-style trick, we allow all known tokens to see each other, and also allow all unknown
tokens to see all known tokens. This full attention introduces better communication across tokens
than causal attention. At inference time, we can generate tokens (one or more per step) using this
bidirectional formulation, which is a form of autoregression. As a compromise, we cannot use the
key-value (kv) cache [44] of causal attention to speed up inference. But as we can generate multiple
tokens together, we can reduce generation steps to speed up inference. Full attention across tokens
can significantly improve the quality and offer a better speed/accuracy trade-off.

1Here the terminology of encoder/decoder is in the sense of a general Autoencoder, following MAE [21]. It
is not related to whether the computation is casual/bidirectional in Transformers [52].

next token prediction

Figure 2: Bidirectional attention can do autoregression.
In contrast to conventional wisdom, the broad concept of
“autoregression” (next token prediction) can be done by
either causal or bidirectional attention. (a) Causal atten-
tion restricts each token to attend only to current/previ-
ous tokens.
With input shifted by one start token [s],
it is valid to compute loss on all tokens at training time.
(b) Bidirectional attention allows each token to see all to-
kens in the sequence. Following MAE [21], mask tokens
[m] are applied in a middle layer, with positional embed-
ding added. This setup only computes loss on unknown
tokens, but it allows for full attention capabilities across
the sequence, enabling better communication across tokens.
This setup can generate tokens one by one at inference time,
which is a form of autoregression. It also allows us to pre-
dict multiple tokens simultaneously.

(a) A standard, raster-order autoregressive model
predicts one next token based on the previous to-
kens. (b) A random-order autoregressive model
predicts the next token given a random order. It
behaves like randomly masking out tokens and
then predicting one. (c) A Masked Autoregressive
(MAR) model predicts multiple tokens simultane-
ously given a random order, which is conceptually
analogous to masked generative models [4, 29]. In
all cases, the prediction of one step can be done by
causal or bidirectional attention (Figure 2).

Autoregressive models in random orders. To connect to masked generative models [4, 29], we
consider an autoregressive variant in random orders. The model is given a randomly permuted
sequence. This random permutation is different for each sample. See Figure 3(b). In this case, the
position of the next token to be predicted needs to be accessible to the model. We adopt a strategy
similar to MAE [21]: we add positional embedding (that corresponds to the unshuffled positions)
to the decoder layers, which can tell what positions to predict. This strategy is applicable for both
causal and bidirectional versions.

As shown in Figure 3 (b)(c), random-order autoregression behaves like a special form of masked
generation, in which one token is generated at a time. We elaborate on this as follows.

Masked autoregressive models. In masked generative modeling [4, 29], the models predict a ran-
dom subset of tokens based on known/predicted tokens. This can be formulated as permuting the to-
ken sequence by a random order, and then predicting multiple tokens based on previous tokens. See
Figure 3(c). Conceptually, this is an autoregressive procedure, which can be written as estimating the
conditional distribution: p({xi, xi+1..., xj} | x1, ..., xi−1), where multiple tokens {xi, xi+1..., xj}
are to be predicted (i ≤j). We can write this autoregressive model as:

p(x1, ..., xn) = p(X1, ..., XK) =

K
Y

k
p(Xk | X1, ..., Xk−1).
(3)

Here, Xk = {xi, xi+1..., xj} is a set of tokens to be predicted at the k-th step, with ∪kXk =
{x1, ..., xn}. In this sense, this is essentially “next set-of-tokens prediction”, and thus is also a
general form of autoregression. We refer to this variant as Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models.
MAR is a random-order autoregressive model that can predict multiple tokens simultaneously.

MAR is conceptually related to MAGE [29]. However, MAR samples tokens by a temperature τ
applied on the probability distribution of each token (which is the standard practice in generative
language models like GPT). In contrast, MAGE (following MaskGIT [4]) applies a temperature for
sampling the locations of the tokens to be predicted: this is not a fully randomized order, which
creates a gap between training-time and inference-time behavior.

Implementation

This section describes our implementation. We note that the concepts introduced in this paper are
general and not limited to specific implementations. More detailed specifics are in Appendix B.

4.1
Diffusion Loss

Diffusion Process. Our diffusion process follows [33]. Our noise schedule has a cosine shape, with
1000 steps at training time; at inference time, it is resampled with fewer steps (by default, 100)
[33]. Our denoising network predicts the noise vector ε [24]. The loss can optionally include the
variational lower bound term Lvlb [33]. Diffusion Loss naturally supports classifier-free guidance
(CFG) [23] (detailed in Appendix B).

Denoising MLP. We use a small MLP consisting of a few residual blocks [20] for denoising. Each
block sequentially applies a LayerNorm (LN) [1], a linear layer, SiLU [12], and another linear layer,
merging with a residual connection. By default, we use 3 blocks and a width of 1024 channels.
The denoising MLP is conditioned on a vector z produced by the AR/MAR model (see Figure 1).
The vector z is added to the time embedding of the noise schedule time-step t, which serves as the
condition of the MLP in the LN layers via AdaLN [37].

4.2
Autoregressive and Masked Autoregressive Image Generation

Tokenizer. We use the publicly available tokenizers provided by LDM [42]. Our experiments will
involve their VQ-16 and KL-16 versions [42]. VQ-16 is a VQ-GAN [13], i.e., VQ-VAE [51] with
GAN loss [15] and perceptual loss [56]; KL-16 is its counterpart regularized by Kullback–Leibler
(KL) divergence, without vector quantization. 16 denotes the tokenizer strides.

Transformer. Our architecture follows the Transformer [52] implementation in ViT [11]. Given a
sequence of tokens from a tokenizer, we add positional embedding [52] and append the class tokens
[cls]; then we process the sequence by a Transformer. By default, our Transformer has 32 blocks
and a width of 1024, which we refer to as the Large size or -L (∼400M parameters).

Autoregressive baseline. Causal attention is implemented following the common practice of GPT
[38] (Figure 2(a)). The input sequence is shifted by one token (here, [cls]). Triangular masking
[52] is applied to the attention matrix. At inference time, temperature (τ) sampling is applied. We
use kv-cache [44] for efficient inference.

Masked autoregressive models. With bidirectional attention (Figure 2(b)), we can predict any
number of unknown tokens given any number of known tokens. At training time, we randomly
sample a masking ratio [21, 4, 29] in [0.7, 1.0]: e.g., 0.7 means 70% tokens are unknown. Because
the sampled sequence can be very short, we always pad 64 [cls] tokens at the start of the encoder
sequence, which improves the stability and capacity of our encoding. As in Figure 2, mask tokens
[m] are introduced in the decoder, with positional embedding added. For simplicity, unlike [21], we
let the encoder and decoder have the same size: each has half of all blocks (e.g., 16 in MAR-L).

At inference, MAR performs “next set-of-tokens prediction”. It progressively reduces the masking
ratio from 1.0 to 0 with a cosine schedule [4, 29]. By default, we use 64 steps in this schedule.
Temperature (τ) sampling is applied. Unlike [4, 29], MAR always uses fully randomized orders.

Experiments

We experiment on ImageNet [9] at a resolution of 256×256. We evaluate FID [22] and IS [43],
and provide Precision and Recall as references following common practice [10]. We follow the
evaluation suite provided by [10].

5.1
Properties of Diffusion Loss

Diffusion Loss vs. Cross-entropy Loss. We first compare continuous-valued tokens with Diffusion
Loss and standard discrete-valued tokens with cross-entropy loss (Table 1). For fair comparisons,
the tokenizers (“VQ-16” and “KL-16”) are both downloaded from the LDM codebase [42]. These
are popularly used tokenizers (e.g., [13, 42, 37]).

consistently observed across all variants of AR and MAR. All entries are implemented by us under
the same setting: AR/MAR-L (∼400M parameters), 400 epochs, ImageNet 256×256.

The comparisons are in four variants of AR/MAR. As shown in Table 1, Diffusion Loss consistently
outperforms the cross-entropy counterpart in all cases. Specifically, in MAR (e.g., the default), using
Diffusion Loss can reduce FID by relatively ∼50%-60%. This is because the continuous-valued
KL-16 has smaller compression loss than VQ-16 (discussed next in Table 2), and also because a
diffusion process models distributions more effectively than categorical ones.

In the following ablations, unless specified, we follow the “default” MAR setting in Table 1.

Flexibility of Diffusion Loss. One significant advantage of Diffusion Loss is its flexibility with
various tokenizers. We compare several publicly available tokenizers in Table 2.

Diffusion Loss can be easily used even given a VQ tokenizer. We simply treat the continuous-valued
latent before the VQ layer as the tokens. This variant gives us 7.82 FID (w/o CFG), compared
favorably with 8.79 FID (Table 1) of cross-entropy loss using the same VQ tokenizer. This suggests
the better capability of diffusion for modeling distributions.

This variant also enables us to compare the VQ-16 and KL-16 tokenizers using the same loss. As
shown in Table 2, VQ-16 has a much worse reconstruction FID (rFID) than KL-16, which conse-
quently leads to a much worse generation FID (e.g., 7.82 vs. 3.50 in Table 2).

Interestingly, Diffusion Loss also enables us to use tokenizers with mismatched strides. In Table 2,
we study a KL-8 tokenizer whose stride is 8 and output sequence length is 32×32. Without in-
creasing the sequence length of the generator, we group 2×2 tokens into a new token. Despite the
mismatch, we are able to obtain decent results, e.g., KL-8 gives us 2.05 FID, vs. KL-16’s 1.98 FID.
Further, this property allows us to investigate other tokenizers, e.g., Consistency Decoder [35], a
non-VQ tokenizer of a different architecture/stride designed for different goals.

For comprehensiveness, we also train a KL-16 tokenizer on ImageNet using the code of [42], noting
that the original KL-16 in [42] was trained on OpenImages [28]. The comparison is in the last row
of Table 2. We use this tokenizer in the following explorations.

Figure 5: Temperature of Diffusion Loss.
Temperature τ has clear influence on both
FID (left) and IS (right). Just like the temper-
ature in discrete-valued autoregression, the
temperature here also plays a critical role in
continuous-valued autoregression.

Denoising MLP in Diffusion Loss. We investigate the denoising MLP in Table 3. Even a very
small MLP (e.g., 2M) can lead to competitive results. As expected, increasing the MLP width helps
improve the generation quality; we have explored increasing the depth and had similar observations.
Note that our default MLP size (1024 width, 21M) adds only ∼5% extra parameters to the MAR-L
model. During inference, the diffusion sampler has a decent cost of ∼10% overall running time. In-
creasing the MLP width has negligible extra cost in our implementation (Table 3), partially because
the main overhead is not about computation but memory communication.

Sampling Steps of Diffusion Loss. Our diffusion process follows the common practice of DDPM
[24, 10]: we train with a 1000-step noise schedule but inference with fewer steps. Figure 4 shows
that using 100 diffusion steps at inference is sufficient to achieve a strong generation quality.

Temperature of Diffusion Loss. In the case of cross-entropy loss, the temperature is of central
importance. Diffusion Loss also offers a temperature counterpart for controlling the diversity and
fidelity. Figure 5 shows the influence of the temperature τ in the diffusion sampler (see Sec. 3.2) at
inference time. The temperature τ plays an important role in our models, similar to the observations
on cross-entropy-based counterparts (note that the cross-entropy results in Table 1 are with their
optimal temperatures).

Properties of Generalized Autoregressive Models

From AR to MAR. Table 1 is also a comparison on the AR/MAR variants, which we discuss
next. First, replacing the raster order in AR with random order has a significant gain, e.g., reducing
FID from 19.23 to 13.07 (w/o CFG). Next, replacing the causal attention with the bidirectional
counterpart leads to another massive gain, e.g., reducing FID from 13.07 to 3.43 (w/o CFG).

The random-order, bidirectional AR is essentially a form of MAR that predicts one token at a time.
Predicting multiple tokens (‘>1’) at each step can effectively reduce the number of autoregressive
steps. In Table 1, we show that the MAR variant with 64 steps slightly trades off generation quality.
A more comprehensive trade-off comparison is discussed next.

Speed/accuracy Trade-off. Following MaskGIT [4], our MAR enjoys the flexibility of predicting
multiple tokens at a time. This is controlled by the number of autoregressive steps at inference time.
Figure 6 plots the speed/accuracy trade-off. MAR has a better trade-off than its AR counterpart,
noting that AR is with the efficient kv-cache.

With Diffusion Loss, MAR also shows a favorable trade-off in comparison with the recently popular
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [37]. As a latent diffusion model, DiT models the interdependence

across all tokens by the diffusion process. The speed/accuracy trade-off of DiT is mainly controlled
by its diffusion steps. Unlike our diffusion process on a small MLP, the diffusion process of DiT
involves the entire Transformer architecture. Our method is more accurate and faster. Notably, our
method can generate at a rate of < 0.3 second per image with a strong FID of < 2.0.

5.3
Benchmarking with Previous Systems

We compare with the leading systems in Table 4. We explore various model sizes (see Appendix B)
and train for 800 epochs. Similar to autoregressive language models [3], we observe encouraging
scaling behavior. Further investigation into scaling could be promising. Regarding metrics, we
report 2.35 FID without CFG, largely outperforming other token-based methods. Our best entry has
1.55 FID and compares favorably with leading systems. Figure 7 shows qualitative results.

Discussion and Conclusion

The effectiveness of Diffusion Loss on various autoregressive models suggests new opportunities:
modeling the interdependence of tokens by autoregression, jointly with the per-token distribution
by diffusion. This is unlike the common usage of diffusion that models the joint distribution of all
tokens. Our strong results on image generation suggest that autoregressive models or their exten-
sions are powerful tools beyond language modeling. These models do not need to be constrained
by vector-quantized representations. We hope our work will motivate the research community to
explore sequence models with continuous-valued representations in other domains.

A
Limitations and Broader Impacts

Limitations. Beyond demonstrating the potential of our method for image generation, this paper
acknowledges its limitations.

First of all, our image generation system can produce images with noticeable artifacts (Figure 8).
This limitation is commonly observed in existing methods, especially when trained on controlled,
academic data (e.g., ImageNet). Research-driven models trained on ImageNet still have a noticeable
gap in visual quality in comparison with commercial models trained on massive data.

Second, our image generation system relies on existing pre-trained tokenizers. The quality of our
system can be limited by the quality of these tokenizers. Pre-training better tokenizers is beyond the
scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we hope our work will make it easier to use continuous-valued
tokenizers to be developed in the future.

Last, we note that given the limited computational resources, we have primarily tested our method
on the ImageNet benchmark. Further validation is needed to assess the scalability and robustness of
our approach in more diverse and real-world scenarios.

Broader Impacts. Our primary aim is to advance the fundamental research on generative models,
and we believe it will be beneficial to this field. An immediate application of our method is to extend
it to large visual generation models, e.g., text-to-image or text-to-video generation. Our approach
has the potential to significantly reduce the training and inference cost of these large models. At
the same time, our method may suggest the opportunity to replace traditional loss functions with
Diffusion Loss in many applications. On the negative side, our method learns statistics from the
training dataset, and as such may reflect the bias in the data; the image generation system may be
misused to generate disinformation, which warrants further consideration.

B
Additional Implementation Details

Classifier-free guidance (CFG). To support CFG [23], at training time, the class condition is re-
placed with a dummy class token for 10% of the samples [23]. At inference time, the model is run
with the given class token and the dummy token, providing two outputs zc and zu. The predicted
noise ε is then modified [23] as: ε = εθ(xt|t, zu) + ω · (εθ(xt|t, zc) −εθ(xt|t, zu)), where ω is
the guidance scale. At inference time, we use a CFG schedule following [5]. We sweep the optimal
guidance scale and temperature combination for each model.

Training. By default, the models are trained using the AdamW optimizer [31] for 400 epochs.
The weight decay and momenta for AdamW are 0.02 and (0.9, 0.95). We use a batch size of 2048
and a learning rate (lr) of 8e-4. Our models with Diffusion Loss are trained with a 100-epoch
linear lr warmup [16], followed by a constant [37] lr schedule. The cross-entropy counterparts are
trained with a cosine lr schedule, which works better for them. Following [37, 25], we maintain the
exponential moving average (EMA) of the model parameters with a momentum of 0.9999.

Implementation Details of Table 4. To explore our method’s scaling behavior, we study three
model sizes described as follows. In addition to MAR-L, we explore a smaller model (MAR-B) and
a larger model (MAR-H). MAR-B, -L, and -H respectively have 24, 32, 40 Transformer blocks and
a width of 768, 1024, and 1280. In Table 4 specifically, the denoising MLP respectively has 6, 8,
12 blocks and a width of 1024, 1280, and 1536. The training length is increased to 800 epochs. At
inference time, we run 256 autoregressive steps to achieve the best results.

Pseudo-code illustrating the concept of Diffusion Loss. Here the conditioning vector z is the output from
the AR/MAR model. The gradient is backpropagated to z. For simplicity, here we omit the code for inference
rescheduling, temperature and the loss term for variational lower bound [10], which can be easily incorporated.

Compute Resources. Our training is mainly done on 16 servers with 8 V100 GPUs each. Training
a 400 epochs MAR-L model takes ∼2.6 days on these GPUs. As a comparison, training a DiT-XL/2
and LDM-4 model for the same number of epochs on this cluster takes 4.6 and 9.5 days, respectively.

C
Comparison between MAR and MAGE

MAR (regardless of the loss used) is conceptually related to MAGE [29]. Besides implementation
differences (e.g., architecture specifics, hyper-parameters), a major conceptual difference between
MAR and MAGE is in the scanning order at inference time. In MAGE, following MaskGIT [4], the
locations of the next tokens to be predicted are determined on-the-fly by the sample confidence at
each location, i.e., the more confident locations are more likely to be selected at each step [4, 29].
In contrast, MAR adopts a fully randomized order, and its temperature sampling is applied to each
token. Table 5 compares this difference in controlled settings. The first line is our MAR imple-
mentation but using MAGE’s on-the-fly ordering strategy, which has similar results as the simpler
random order counterpart. Fully randomized ordering can make the training and inference process
consistent regarding the distribution of orders; it also allows us to adopt token-wise temperature
sampling in a way similar to autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT [38, 39, 3]).

of determining the order on the fly by confidence sampling across the spatial domain. These entries
are all based on the tokenizers provided by the LDM codebase [42].

Additional Comparisons

D.1
Autoregressive Image Generation in Pixel Space

Our MAR+DiffLoss approach can also be directly applied to model the RGB pixel space without
the need for an image tokenizer. To demonstrate this, we conducted an experiment on ImageNet
64×64, grouping every 4×4 pixels into a single token for the Diffusion Loss to model. A MAR-
L+DiffLoss model trained for 400 epochs achieved an FID of 2.93, demonstrating the potential
to eliminate the need for tokenizers in autoregressive image generation. However, as commonly
observed in the diffusion model literature, directly modeling the pixel space is significantly more
computationally expensive than using a tokenizer. For MAR+DiffLoss, directly modeling pixels
at higher resolutions might require either a much longer sequence length for the autoregressive
transformer or a substantially larger network for the Diffusion Loss to handle larger patches. We
leave this exploration for future work.

D.2
ImageNet 512×512

Following previous works, we also report results on ImageNet at a resolution of 512×512, compared
with leading systems (Table 6). For simplicity, we use the KL-16 tokenizer, which gives a sequence
length of 32×32 on a 512×512 image. Other settings follow the MAR-L configuration described
in Table 4. Our method achieves an FID of 2.74 without CFG and 1.73 with CFG. Our results are
competitive with those of previous systems. Due to limited resources, we have not trained the larger
MAR-H on ImageNet 512×512, which is expected to have better results.

D.3
L2 Loss vs. Diff Loss

A na¨ıve baseline for continuous-valued tokens is to compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE, i.e., L2)
loss directly between the predictions and the target tokens. In the case of a raster-order AR model,
using the L2 loss introduces no randomness and thus cannot generate diverse samples. In the case
of the MAR models with the L2 loss, the only randomness is the sequence order; the prediction at
a location is deterministic for any given order. In our experiment, we have trained an MAR model
with the L2 loss, which as expected leads to a disastrous FID score (>100).

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This paper presents an autoregresive image generation method without vector
quantization.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these
goals are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means
that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The au-
thors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what
the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the ap-
proach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to ad-
dress problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical contribution.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo-
rems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a
short proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple-
mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu-
sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See section 4 and Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps
taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture
fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation,
it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with
the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data
is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via
detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in
the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means
that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all sub-
missions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear
how to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to re-
produce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to
construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case au-
thors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/LTH14/mar.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See section 4 and Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of
detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropri-
ate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Following common practice in the generative modeling literature, we do not
report error bars in this paper because of the heavy computation overheads.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

19


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer-
ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of
Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments
that didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: see Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact spe-
cific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitiga-
tion strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will require the users to adhere to usage guidelines for our released mod-
els.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by re-
quiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or
implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We properly cite the original assets in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the li-
cense of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can
either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the pa-
per include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable,
as well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should
be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, cura-
tion, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the
data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equiva-
lent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval,
you should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity
(if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
