Abstract

We initiate an investigation into the optimization properties of next-token prediction
(NTP), the dominant training paradigm for modern language models. Specifically,
we study the structural properties of the solutions selected by gradient-based
optimizers among the many possible minimizers of the NTP objective. By framing
NTP as cross-entropy minimization across distinct contexts, each tied with a
sparse conditional probability distribution across a finite vocabulary of tokens,
we introduce “NTP-separability conditions” that enable reaching the data-entropy
lower bound. With this setup, and focusing on linear models with fixed context
embeddings, we characterize the optimization bias of gradient descent (GD): Within
the data subspace defined by the sparsity patterns of distinct contexts, GD selects
parameters that equate the logits’ differences of in-support tokens to their log-
odds. In the orthogonal subspace, the GD parameters diverge in norm and select
the direction that maximizes a margin specific to NTP. These findings extend
previous research on implicit bias in one-hot classification to the NTP setting,
highlighting key differences and prompting further research into the optimization
and generalization properties of NTP, irrespective of the specific architecture used
to generate the context embeddings.

Introduction

Next-token prediction (NTP) has emerged as the go-to paradigm in training modern language models,
revolutionizing various applications such as machine translation, text-summarization, and language
generation [66]. In NTP, models are trained to predict the most probable token given a sequence
of preceding tokens, commonly referred to as the context. Concretely, the objective is to learn a
mapping from the input context to the probability distribution over the (finite) vocabulary of possible
tokens, enabling the model to generate a token that is contextually appropriate [9, 8]. Recently, the
NTP paradigm has witnessed remarkable empirical success through its utilization on large-scale
deep-learning architectures trained on vast corpora of data [66, 67, 86], leading to unprecedented
advances in the field, and the swift integration of these advanced language models into society
[62]. Concurrently, researchers have raised critical concerns about robustness, interpretability, and
fairness-bias issues arising from our limited understanding of the fundamental operational principles
of these models [10, 6]. Despite progress, a comprehensive theory that elucidates the fundamentals
of modern language models—including key components like the NTP paradigm and transformer
architecture, particularly in terms of optimization and generalization principles—is still lacking.

We initiate an investigation when implicit optimization biases in training language models under
the NTP paradigm, particularly in overparameterized regimes where the empirical-loss reaches its
lower bound and there is many possible minimizers. To formalize the NTP paradigm, consider

38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

autoregressive model qθ parameterized by θ trained to predict the next-token on sequences of length
T using the cross-entropy (CE) loss:

min
θ
ˆEz∼Tn[∑t∈[T ] −log (qθ(zt ∣z1,...,zt−1))].
(1)

Here, sequences z = (z1,...,zT ) consist of tokens zt from a finite vocabulary V = {1,...,V }
and ˆE is expectation over training set Tn of n such sequences sampled from some underlying true
distribution over sequences. Typically, the model qθ outputs probability of the next token computed
via softmax applied on output logits, which are computed by projecting d-dimensional embeddings
hθ′ to the V -dimensional space with a trainable linear decoder W ∈RV ×d. Formally, 1

qθ(zt ∣z1,...,zt−1) = Szt(W hθ′(z1,...,zt−1)) =
1
1 + ∑z′∈V
z′≠zt
exp((ez′ −ezt)⊺W hθ′(z1,...,zt−1)) .

The CE loss is then minimized over θ = (W ,θ′) using gradient-based methods, e.g. (S)GD, Adam.

We pose the question: Given training set Tn, what are the structural properties of the weights θ
found by minimizing the NTP objective with gradient-based optimizers? As in prior research in
one-hot supervised classification 2 (e.g. [97, 7, 76, 34]), we specifically target this question in an
overparameterized setting, where the NTP objective (1) may have an infinite number of solutions,
representing an infinite number of models θ that minimize the training loss. The central challenge
is to discern the particular solution the optimizer is inherently biased towards. Since this ‘bias’ is
not explicitly introduced through regularization but is instead ingrained in the training objective
and algorithmic structure, it is termed ‘implicit bias’ [61]. The exploration of implicit bias has a
long history in the traditional supervised one-hot classification (see Related Work in Sec. 6). In this
traditional scenario, the training set comprises feature-label pairs (x,y), where x ∈Rp is a continuous
feature, and y represents its unique label. The optimization process minimizes the following training
objective (over W ,θ′): ˆE(x,y) [−log (Sy(W hθ′(x)))].

At first glance, excluding the sequential format of Eq. (1), the NTP training scenario might seem identi-
cal to traditional one-hot prediction: both aim to minimize the same CE loss across models that param-
eterize probabilities using the softmax of logits. Consider predicting the next token over fixed-length
sequences, say sequences of length t −1, via optimizing: ˆEz [−log (Szt(W hθ(z1,...,zt−1)))].
The context here acts as the feature, and the next token as the label. Recent works [49, 52] draw
on such apparent similarities to the traditional one-hot classification paradigm to extrapolate known
results from the latter to the NTP setting. However, this comparison overlooks a fundamental, yet
critical difference in the nature of the training data that distinguishes these two paradigms (even when
the sequential format of Eq. (1) is disregarded): In the traditional setting, each feature (e.g., image) is
assigned a single label (e.g., image category). In contrast, in the NTP setting, contexts z1,...,zt−1 of
finite length sampled from finite vocabularies are naturally repeated in a (vast) training set, potentially
multiple times, each time followed by different tokens zt [73]. Consequently, the NTP paradigm
involves training over m ≤n distinct (non-repetitive) contexts, each followed by a multitude of possi-
ble next tokens, appearing at varying frequencies. For instance, the context "She is excellent
at her role as a" may be followed by next tokens such as "doctor," "lawyer," "reviewer,"
or "mother," each with different frequencies. Importantly, certain vocabulary tokens may not appear
after a given context; e.g., in the above example, tokens like "run," "and," etc., will not follow.

Model. We study NTP training over a finite vocabulary employing the following model. Given a large
training set of n total sequences, we identify m ≤n distinct contexts. Each distinct context j ∈[m] is
linked to a V -dimensional empirical probability vector ˆpj, which encodes the frequency with which
each vocabulary token follows the context throughout its occurrences in the training set. Crucially,
the probability vectors ˆpj are sparse, i.e., the support set Sj of ˆpj satisfies ∣Sj∣≪∣V∣= V . In an
extreme where ∣Sj∣= 1,∀j ∈[m], the probability vector ˆpj becomes one-hot, leading to a scenario
reminiscent of the traditional classification setting described earlier. However, such an extreme is
essentially improbable in practical language modeling [73]. With this framing, the NTP paradigm is

1Throughout, ev ∈RV is the v-th standard basis vector, and Sz(u) = e⊺
zS(u) the z-th entry of softmax output.
2In NTP, the ground-truth next token is inherently embedded within the underlying text, thus strictly speaking, it
falls under the self-supervised learning paradigm [66]. Yet, the utilization of the CE training objective resembles
to supervised training. We leverage this resemblance and regard NTP training as an instance of supervised
learning, while also emphasizing how it differs from one-hot encoding supervision.

also related to supervised vision classification with soft labels, which advocates for training models
on datasets where each example is associated with a vector of soft labels (rather than a one-hot
vector), such as by averaging multiple annotators’ hard labels [65], knowledge distillation [32] or
label smoothing [79]. With this connection, our analysis can also be interpreted (more broadly) as
investigating the implicit bias of sparse soft-label classification.

1.1
Contributions and Organization

Formulation. Recognizing the differences between NTP and one-hot classification, we study the
question of implicit optimization bias within the NTP setting. To facilitate this, we utilize the model
outlined in the previous paragraph and detailed in Sec. 2. For concreteness, our analysis adopts
a ’top-down’ approach, training only the decoding (also referred to as word-embedding) matrix
W ∈RV ×d while keeping context-embeddings fixed. This approach mirrors foundational studies on
implicit optimization bias in one-hot classification [76, 34], which first focused on linear models.
It allows exploring the complexities of the NTP training objective, distinct from the embedding
architecture3, and while it renders the logits linear and the objective convex, it still poses a technical
challenge in terms of determining parameter convergence [76, 34, 37, 60, 38].

Conditions for reaching entropy. In Sec. 3, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions
for the logits of the trained model to enable the CE loss to approach its lower bound, the empirical
conditional entropy. We introduce two conditions: NTPH-compatibility and NTP-separability, which
impose constraints on mutually orthogonal subspaces that are determined by the sparsity patterns
of distinct contexts within the dataset. These conditions determine the necessary and sufficient
overparameterization a model needs to achieve the empirical entropy lower bound during training.

Margin in NTP setting. Motivated by the NTP-separability condition, we introduce a margin
concept for NTP in Sec. 4, which extends the classical definition of margin used in one-hot supervised
classification [88]. We further establish the relevance of this new margin notion for optimization by
demonstrating that a decoder maximizing the NTP-margin, denoted as W mm, guides the directional
convergence of the ridge-regularized CE minimizer, ̂
Wλ, as the regularization parameter λ →0.

Implicit bias of GD. We establish that W mm also determines the implicit bias of gradient descent
(GD) iterates in Sec. 5. Specifically, in the limit of iterations k →∞, the GD iterates grow
undoubtedly in norm and converge to a finite W ⋆within a data subspace F, while simultaneously
aligning with W mm in the complementary subspace F⊥. The finite component W ⋆∈F solves a
system of linear equations associated with the NTPH-compatibility condition.
Finally, we numerically verify these findings and discuss related and future work in Secs. 6 and 7.
Additional experiments, further related work and detailed proofs are in the appendix.

Setup

Let vocabulary V = [V ] ∶= {1,...,V } represent a set of V tokens (e.g. words) and z1∶t = (z1,...,zt)
denote sequence of t tokens zt ∈V. To simplify presentation, we focus on predicting the T-th token
zT given contexts z<T ∶= z1∶T −1 of fixed length, and we further let x = z<t denote the context and z
denote the last token. See App. C for straightforward extension to the sequential format of Eq. (1).

We assume access to a training set consisting of n sequences Tn ∶= {(xi,zi)}i∈[n], with xi ∈X ∶=
VT −1 and zi ∈V. Let h ∶X →Rd an embedding map that maps contexts (i.e., sequences of T −1
tokens) to d-dimensional embeddings. The map h can be parameterized (e.g. by a transformer [90] or
an LSTM [5]), but this paper assumes that it is fixed. The next-token is predicted via a linear model
fW ∶X →RV parameterized by decoding matrix W ∈RV ×d, such that fW (x) = W h(x). When
the model output passes through a softmax, it defines the model’s probability mass function for the
next-token prediction, given as ˆqW (⋅∣x) = S(fW (x)), where S(⋅) ∶RV →∆V −1 is the softmax and
∆V −1 is the V -dimensional simplex. The decoder is trained by minimizing the empirical CE loss
CE(W ) ∶= 1

n ∑i∈[n] −log (ˆqW (zi∣xi)).

Distinct sequences and next-token distributions. Given dataset Tn we denote ¯x1,..., ¯xm the
m ≤n distinct contexts among the (large number of) total n contexts x1,...,xn within Tn. Let ˆπj

3NTP is widely used across various modern language modeling architectures, including transformers [66, 67],
state-space models [26, 27], and LSTMs [5].

be the empirical probability of distinct context ¯xj. That is, 1 ≤n⋅ˆπj ≤n is the number of contexts xi
that equal ¯xj. Furthermore, for each distinct context ¯xj,j ∈[m] let ˆpj ∈∆V −1 denote the probability
vector of conditional next-token distribution, i.e., ˆpj,z ∶= ˆp(z∣¯xj),z ∈V,j ∈[m]. In other words,
n⋅ˆπj ⋅ˆpj,z is the number of occurences of token z as a follow-up to context ¯xj. Finally, we denote the
support set and size of the support set of these conditional distributions as Sj ∶= {z ∈V ∣ˆpj,z > 0} and
Sj ∶= ∣Sj∣. Tokens z ∈Sj and v ∉Sj are referred to as ’in-support’ and ’out-of-support’ respectively.
Onwards, we implicitly assume that “not all tokens are likely after every context,” i.e. ∃j ∈[m] such
that Sj < V . This mild assumption is naturally satisfied in language modeling under rich enough
vocabulary. With this notation, 4 we can express the NTP training loss as

CE(W ) = −∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈V
ˆpj,z log (Sz(W h(¯xj))) = −∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log (Sz(W ¯hj)),
(2)

where, in the last line we defined the shorthand ¯hj = h(¯xj). Similarly, we let hi = h(xi),i ∈[n].
With some abuse of notation, we then obtain the following equivalent descriptions of the training set

{(xi,zi)}i∈[n] =∶Tn ≡Tm ∶= {(¯hj, ˆπj, ˆpj,z∈V)}j∈[m]
that emphasizes distinct contexts and their respsective sparse next-token probability distributions.

Entropy. The empirical T-gram entropy (referred to hereafter as entropy for simplicity) of the
dataset is [74, 73]: HT ∶= H ∶= ˆE(x,z)∼Tn [−log (ˆp(z∣x))] = −∑j∈[m] ∑z∈Sj ˆπj ˆpj,z log (ˆpj,z) . It
lower bounds the CE loss since CE(W ) = H + KL(ˆp∣∣ˆqW ) and the KL divergence is nonnegative.

3
When can the NTP-loss reach the entropy lower-bound?

The first question we ask is: Under what conditions on the training data can the CE loss reach its
entropy lower-bound? By the entropy lower-bound, CE(W ) = H ⇔KL(ˆp∣∣ˆqW ) = 0 iff for all
j ∈[m] and all z ∈V: ˆqW (z∣¯xj) = ˆpj,z. Equivalently, for all j ∈[m]:

Sz(W ¯hj) = ˆpj,z,
∀z ∈Sj ,
(3a)

Sv(W ¯hj) = 0,
∀v ∉Sj .
(3b)

Beginning with (3a), this requires5 the training data to satisfy the NTPH-compatibility condition
defined below.
Definition 1 (NTPH-compatible). Let ev denote the v-th standard basis vector in RV . We say that
training data Tm are NTP-entropy-compatible if there exists V × d matrix W p satisfying:

∀j ∈[m],z ≠z′ ∈Sj ∶(ez −ez′)⊺W p¯hj = log (ˆpj,z/ˆpj,z′) .
(4)

We comment on the independence of the constraints: Fix any j ∈[m]. Then, the set of constraints (as
expressed in Eq. (4)) for all z ≠z′ ∈Sj (yielding (Sj
2 ) constraints in total) is equivalent to the set of
the same constraints for any anchor zj ∈Sj and z′ ≠zj ∈Sj, i.e., an effective total of Sj −1 linearly
independent constraints for each j ∈[m]. Additionally, note that the system of equations in Eq. (4)
constrains W p with respect to a specific subspace of V × d matrices:

F = span({(ez −ez′)¯h⊺
j ∶z ≠z′ ∈Sj,j ∈[m]}),
(5)

that is defined in terms of context embeddings and their respective support sets. Assuming Eqs. (4)
have a solution, we denote the unique solution within the subspace F as W ⋆∈F for later reference 6.

Next, we examine Eq. (3b), which requires softmax outputs be zero for tokens that never occur
following a fixed context throughout the dataset. Due to the strict positivity of softmax, the constraint
is never satisfied for finite W . Thus, for all finite W , there exists a gap between the cross-entropy
loss and its lower bound, i.e., CE(W ) > H. Yet, it is possible to approach entropy as the norm of the
weights W grows, provided that weights move in the appropriate direction formalized below.

4A complete list of notations is also given in Appendix D.
5It will be see below, and can be easily checked by the reader, this condition alone is insufficient; the NTP-
separability condition in Defn. 2 is also needed.
6If Eqs. (4) have a solution, say W1, every other solution takes the form W p = W1 + Wnull, where Wnull is
orthogonal to (ez −ez′)¯hT
j ∶z ≠z′ ∈Sj, j ∈[m]. Thus, Wnull ∈F⊥is in the orthogonal complement of F.

Definition 2 (NTP-separable). We say that training data Tm are NTP-separable if there exists V × d
matrix W d satisfying the following:

∀j ∈[m],z ≠z′ ∈Sj ∶(ez −ez′)⊺W d¯hj = 0
(6a)

∀j ∈[m],z ∈Sj,v ∉Sj ∶(ez −ev)⊺W d¯hj ≥1.
(6b)

As before, it is easy to see that the constraints in (6) can be equivalently expressed by enforcing (6a)
and (6b) for an anchor zj ∈Sj and all z′ ∈Sj / {zj} and v ∉Sj, respectively. Consequently, there
exist effectively V −1 linearly independent constraints per context j ∈[m].

We now discuss the interpretation of these constraints. The subspace constraints in Eq. (6a) project
W d onto the subspace F⊥, which is the orthogonal complement of the subspace F defined in (5).
This leaves the softmax probabilities of possible next tokens (in set Sj) intact, and fully determined
by W p as per the NTPH-compatibility condition. Formally, W p + W d continues satisfying (4).
Moving on the halfspace constraints in (6b), we can interpret these using Kesler’s construction
as enforcing linear separability in the space RV ×d [30]: Each d-dimensional context embedding
¯hj is mapped to Sj(V −Sj) higher-dimensional points (ez −ev)¯h⊺
j,z ∈Sj,v ∉Sj. These points
collectively for all j ∈[m] must lie within the interior of the same halfspace induced by the hyperplane
⟨W d,⋅⟩= 0. Refer to Fig. 1(Left) and its caption for an alternative interpretation of the rows of
W mm as word-embeddings in Rd (illustration in d = 2).

The impact of NTP-separability on the softmax probabilities can be understood algebraically by
considering Wγ ∶= γW d and v ∉Sj. We have:

Sv(W γ¯hj) = ( ∑
z∈Sj
eγ(ez−ev)⊺W d¯hj + ∑
v′∉Sj
eγ(ev′−ev)⊺W d¯hj)
−1

≤( ∑
z∈Sj
eγ(ez−ev)⊺W d¯hj)
−1

≤e−γ,
(7)

where the first inequality removes non-negative exponential terms and the second one follows from
(6b). The upper bound above approaches 0 as γ →∞, thus (3b) holds asymptotically in γ.

Taking into account the observations made above, the satisfaction of both conditions guarantees
convergence of the cross-entropy loss CE to H. This is formalized in the proposition below.

Proposition 1. Assume training data Tm is NTPH-compatible and NTP-separable, with the respective
matrices W p and W d satisfying conditions (4) and (6). While all finite W satisfy CE(W ) > H, it
holds for W γ = W p + γ ⋅W d that CE(W γ)
γ→+∞
ÐÐÐ→H.

Hence, CE approaches its lower-bound in the limit of a direction W d ∶= W d/∥W d∥and offset W p
satisfying the constraints of NTP-separability and NTP-compatibility, respectively. In other words,
parameter weights W that minimize the CE loss consist of two components: a finite projection
WF ∶= PF(W ) = W ⋆onto the data subspace F and an infinite-norm component onto the orthogonal
complement F⊥in the direction of W d.

Finally, we note that while Defns. 1 and 2 are stated for linear models, they naturally extend to a
more general formulation for nonlinear models. Specifically, consider NTP-separability (similar
for NTP-compatibility): the general conditions require that both the decoder weights W and model
weights θ, which parameterize the embeddings ¯hj = hθ(¯xj), must satisfy Eq. (6) simultaneously.

3.1
The role of overparameterization

We show that overparameterization provides a sufficient condition for the solvability of Eqs. (4) and
(6). Start with the halfspace constraints in Eq. (4) for NTPH-compatibility. These can be compactly
expressed as Ej,zjW p¯hj = aj,z, where Ej,zj ∈R(Sj−1)×V has rows ezj −ez′ and aj,zj ∈R(Sj−1)

has entries log (ˆpj,zj/ˆpj,z′) for some anchor zj ∈Sj. Now, since the rows of Ej,zj are linearly
independent, the question becomes equivalently that of determining when W p[¯h1,..., ¯hm] =
[E†
1,z1a1,z1,...,E†
m,zmam,zm] has a solution. This is always the case when d > m and the d × m

---Page Break---
embedding matrix ¯
H = [¯h1,..., ¯hm] is full rank (m). Then, there exists W p such that condition
(4) holds. In fact, ¯
H⊺has a nullspace, implying the existence of an infinite number of solutions to
(4). These solutions take the form W p = W ⋆+ W p
⊥, where W ⋆∈F is the unique solution onto the
subspace, and W p
⊥∈F⊥.

In contrast to (4), the constraints in (6) involve linear inequalities. However, a sufficient proxy for
feasibility in this case is that the corresponding system of equations (instead of inequalities) has a
solution. By following the exact same argument as before, we arrive at the same sufficient conditions
for the existence of a solution W d. We summarize these findings.
Lemma 1 (Overparameterization implies NTP-separability). Assume overparameterization d > m
and full-rank embedding matrix ¯
H ∈Rd×m. Then, there exists an infinite number of solutions W p
and W d that satisfy conditions (4) and (6), respectively.

Thus, d > m, 7 which also generically favors full-rankness of the embedding matrix [92], implies
both NTPH-compatibility and NTP-separability. Combined with Prop. 1, it also implies that there
are infinitely many possible directions W d along which the NTP loss approaches H, motivating the
implicit-bias question: For a specific iterative algorithm aimed at minimizing the NTP loss, which
direction does it prefer? We will address this question in the remainder of the paper.
Remark 1. In the trivial case where Sj = 1,∀j ∈[m] (one-hot classification), the entropy lower
bound is zero and is attained iff the data is linearly separable. Indeed, F reduces to the empty
set, and NTP-separability simplifies to traditional multiclass separability. For binary classification,
[20] showed that d/m > 1/2 is sufficient and necessary for data in general position to be linearly
separable. More recently, several works have extended this analysis to structured (random) data,
including [12, 71, 57, 54]. The exact threshold in corresponding mutliclass settings is more intricate,
but [19, 81, 11] have made progress in this direction. An interesting question is determining exact
thresholds for NTP-separability, which would improve upon the sufficient condition of Lemma 1.

Regularization path

This section investigates the implicit bias of NTP by examining the minimization of CE loss through
iterates defined as follows for an increasing sequence of positive regularization parameters B:

̂
WB ∶= arg min∥W ∥≤B CE(W ).
(8)

This involves minimizing a strictly convex function in a bounded domain; thus, ̂
WB is unique. This
section’s main result characterizes the limit of ̂
WB as B →∞under NTP-separability/compatibility.
Before that, we first define the next-token prediction support-vector machines (SVM) problem.
Definition 3 (NTP-SVM). Given NTP-separable training set Tm, NTP-SVM solves the following:

W mm ∶= arg minW ∥W ∥
subj. to W ∈RV ×d satisfying (6a) and (6b).
(NTP-SVM)

This is a strongly convex quadratic program with mV −∑j∈[m] Sj linear inequality and ∑j∈[m] Sj −m
linear equality constraints. Its solution can be also defined as the classifier that maximizes margin
between in and out-of -support tokens while being constrained on the orthogonal compelemnt F⊥:

W mm = arg max∥W ∥=1,W ∈F⊥minj∈[m],z∈Sj,v∉Sj(ez −ev)⊺W ¯hj.

It turns out this direction determines the preferred limiting direction of the regularization path.
Theorem 1 (Implicit bias of the regularization-path). Assume training data Tm is NTPH-compatible
and NTP-separable. Let ̂
WB be defined as in (8). Then, it holds that limB→∞⟨
̂
WB
∥̂
WB∥,
W mm

∥W mm∥⟩= 1.

The proof sketch below illustrates how the NTP-separability/compatibility assumptions influence the
outcome and why the regularization path induces an optimization bias toward the NTP-SVM direction.
Complementing Thm. 1, we also show (see Lemma 4 in the appendix) that limB→∞PF(WB) = W ⋆.
These together provide a complete characterization of the implicit optimization bias of (8).

7The necessity for such large d can be mitigated through the utilization of non-linear architectures (such as an
MLP decoder), in which the total number of parameters can be increased by augmenting the width or depth,
rather than directly modifying the embedding dimension d as in linear models.

Proof sketch (App. E.2 for details). We first show ̂
WB is on the boundary: ∥̂
WB∥= B. If not, then
⟨∇CE(̂

where we denote sj,v ∶= Sv(̂
WB¯hj) > 0,v ∈V,j ∈[m]. The first term in the parenthesis is zero by
(6a), while the second term is strictly positive by (6b), leading to contradiction.

Now, consider a ‘genie’ point W ⋆
B = W ⋆+R(B)⋅W mm, where W ⋆∈F satisfies (4), and R = R(B)
is chosen such that ∥W ⋆
B∥= B. We will show that W ⋆
B attains a small CE loss as B (hence, R)
grows. To do this, denote for convenience the logits

ℓ⋆

Moreover, using (6b) and defining C ∶= V e∥W ⋆∥M for M ∶=

Combining the above within Eq. (2), using log(1 + x) ≤x,x > 0 and the fact that ˆπj, ˆpj,z are

(9)

Next, towards contradiction, we will show that if ̂
WB is not in the direction of W mm, then it incurs
a loss that is larger than CE(W ⋆
B). The trick here is to bound the KL divergence term:

CE(̂
WB) −H = ∑

(10)

where we denote logits ℓj,v ∶= e⊺
v ̂
WB¯hj. Assume there exists ϵ > 0 and arbitrarily large B satisfying:

∥(∥W mm∥/B) ̂
WB −W mm∥> ϵ.
(11)

Define ̂
W = (̂
WB −W ⋆)/R′(B), where R′ = R′(B) > 0 can be chosen so that ∥̂
W ∥= ∥W mm∥.
Further choose B large enough so that Eq. (11) guarantees ∥̂
W −W mm∥≥ϵ′, for some ϵ′ > 0.
Since W mm is the unique minimizer of (NTP-SVM) and ∥̂

W ¯hj ≤1 −δ.

Case (i): Without loss of generality (ez −ez′)⊺̂

Gradient Descent

This section studies the implicit bias of GD. Denote the GD iterates at time k by Wk = Wk−1 −
η∇CE(Wk−1) for arbitrary initial point W0 and constant step-size η > 0 small enough to guarantee
descent. The first observation is that the norm of the GD iterates increases with iterations.
Lemma 2 (Norm growth). If training data are NTPH-compatible and NTP-separable, then
limk→∞CE(Wk) = H and limk→∞∥Wk∥= ∞.

This is intuitive because the CE loss is convex in W (thus, GD approaches the objective’s infimum
H), and, in view of Proposition 1, the CE loss at all finite W is bounded away from H. The relevant
question then becomes that of determining the limit of the direction of the GD iterates.
Theorem 2 (Implicit bias of GD). Assume NTPH-compatible and NTP-separable training data Tm.
Then, it holds that limk→∞⟨Wk

∥Wk∥,
W mm

∥W mm∥⟩= 1. Moreover, limk→∞PF(Wk) = W ⋆.

The theorem establishes 8 that in the limit of iterations: Wk ≈W ⋆+ ∥P⊥(Wk)∥W mm, which is
analogous to the result we obtained previously for the regularization path. Although its proof is more
involved compared to the proof of Thm. 1, the proof of its main ingredient (Lem. 5 in the appendix)
is conceptually similar: It involves comparing the loss CE(Wk) for large iterations k to the loss
evaluated at a “genie” point that is chosen so that: (i) On the subspace F, it agrees with Wk. This
is because it is easy to show that PF(Wk) converges to W ⋆by standard gradient descent analysis
for convex functions; (ii) On the orthogonal subspace F⊥, it follows the optimal (with respect to
accelerating loss decrease) max-margin direction W mm ∈F⊥. To establish the loss comparison, the
ideas is to compare the values of the adjusted loss CE⊥(W ) ∶= CE(W ) −CE(PF(W )).

We validate our analysis with experiments on synthetic data in App. A. For illustration, Fig. 1 shows
a 2D setting with m = 3 distinct contexts, each followed by Sj = 3 tokens/words out of total V = 5
words in the vocabulary. The left subfigure illustrates: (i) In black markers, the context-embedding
geometry along with the associated support sets for each context A, B, and C. (ii) In colored markers,
the geometry of word-embeddings, that is the max-NTP-margin vectors (W mm)⊺ev,v ∈[5], to
which GD directionally converges. See caption for interpretation and Fig. 2 in the App. for vis. of
the finite component of word-embeddings on the subspace F. The right subfigure shows results of
GD training with respect to training loss, norm growth, alignment with W mm, and convergence to
W ⋆on F. See App. A for further implementation details and additional experiments.

Related work

We build on the literature on implicit optimization bias of CE loss in one-hot supervised classification.
[76] show that for linear models and linearly-separable data, GD converges in direction to the max-
margin classifier. This result strengthens [68] that showed the regularization path of CE minimization
converges to the same limit. Closer to us, [34, 37] extend the analysis to encompass general binary
data as follows: the data are linearly separable only on a certain subspace, and they show that GD
converges, in direction, towards the max-margin classifier confined within that subspace. On the
orthogonal subspace, it converges to a finite point. While operationally similar, Thms. 1, 2 cannot

8In line with observations in one-hot encoding [59], we anticipate the directional behavior remains unchanged
under stochasticity, e.g. when using SGD to minimize (2). Yet, note a subtle but crucial difference in applying
SGD to (1) vs (2), as the latter involves sampling distinct contexts in each iteration. In this latter case, we also
point out that favorable interpolation conditions, such as strong-growth (e.g., [91]), can be shown to hold.

to intuitive findings on their geometry learned by NTP training. E.g., word embedding w3 (almost)
aligns with context-embedding A and the normal hyperplane it defines separates A from B and C,
since word 3 only appears after context A. The rest of the words follow two contexts each and their
word-representation naturally belongs to the cone defined by the embeddings of those respective
contexts. The wider the cone, the larger the magnitude of the word embedding to compensate for
the large angle between context-representations that share the same next-word. Note that geometry
of depicted word embeddings only depends on support sets, but the conditional probabilities define
another set of word representations on an orthogonal (matrix) subspace; see text for details and vis.

be directly derived from theirs since our setting is neither binary nor one-hot. Nevertheless, our
proofs extend the foundational work of [68, 34, 37], akin to numerous other studies that explore
extensions to nonlinear architectures[50, 35, 28, 29, 83, 89], and to stochastic and adaptive algorithms
[60, 64, 21, 47, 77, 3, 14, 2]. The implicit bias viewpoint has also created opportunities to study
generalization in overparameterized settings. [31, 4, 57, 22] build a two-stage approach initially
leveraging implicit bias to simplify the complexities of optimization before addressing generalization.
This narrows the generalization question to the properties of the corresponding max-margin classifier
[58, 13, 43, 78, 23, 100, 72, 94]. The same strategy has also been adopted to study model robustness
to adversarial perturbations [33, 80, 16], out-of-distribution data [87], and imbalances [69, 15, 42].
Our results motivate such extensions in the richer NTP setting.

Recent work [49] also studies forms of implicit bias for language models trained to reach the risk
lower bound. However, they assume training with population loss and analyze implicit bias through
Hessian-trace minimization without providing explicit parameter characterizations as in Thm. 2.
Crucially, their results do not apply to CE loss9 or to sparse support-sets. Another interesting work
[52] studies learning abilities of autoregressive training and inference. However, their findings do not
apply to NTP as they inherently assume each context is followed by a unique next token.

Finally, although stemming from different perspectives, the form of our convergence results echoes a
recent conjecture by [82] regarding implicit optimization bias in transformers. Unlike their conjecture,
which focuses on binary classification, our results are rigorously proven and apply to the NTP setting.
Further detailed discussion on related follow-up work on implicit optimization bias in self-attention
architectures, as initiated by [83], is deferred to Appendix B. In contrast to this line of work, we
here focus on the optimization biases of the NTP training-paradigm itself, which is orthogonal to the
intricacies of the specific architecture generating the context embeddings.

9[49, Thm. 4.3] uses [47, Cor. 5.2], which applies to regression on scalar labels; thus is not applicable in NTP.

Conclusion, limitations and future work

Towards characterizing implicit regularization effects, we highlight two key aspects of NTP training:
(i) Formulating it as CE optimization over distinct contexts; this is long recognized in language
modeling (e.g., [44, 63]) since Shannon’s initial work, yet seemingly overlooked in recent studies,
such as [49, 52]. (ii) Accounting for sparsity in the matrix of next-token conditional probabilities.
While traditional language modeling techniques often mitigate sparsity using smoothing heuristics
that assign non-zero probabilities to unobserved next tokens [44, 63, 39], we recognize sparsity as a
critical factor in NTP optimization that influences parameter divergence10.

As the first study of implicit biases in NTP training, our results are based on several assumptions
essential for establishing an initial foundational understanding. The framework allows for various
exciting promising research directions, some of which we outline below.

Even within the assumed linear setting and GD, interesting directions involve:

●NTP-separability thresholds: Identifying exact thresholds for NTP-separability under distribu-
tional assumptions, akin to previous work on one-hot separability (Remark 1). However, relaxing the
overparameterization requirement that the embedding dimension d be proportional to the number of
distinct contexts m would necessitate exploring non-convex architectures (see ’Memory capacity’
below).

●Generalization: Studying generalization in NTP settings by examining statistical properties of
the NTP-SVM solution. Past research has successfully undertaken similar investigations for one-hot
classification (see Sec. 6). While we acknowledge the importance of addressing specific challenges
inherent to NTP —such as determining an appropriate measure of generalization, or establishing
suitable statistical models for context-embeddings that respect the discrete nature of the underlying
token subsequences—we believe this direction holds promise for further exploration.

In addition to these, essential extensions include relaxing the linearity assumption.

●Architecture-specific embeddings: A bottom-up approach considering architecture-specific
embeddings could begin by modeling the embeddings produced by, for instance, a shallow transformer
and analyzing the effects of optimization biases on the training of both the transformer and the decoder
weights. This complements the works of [83, 82], who investigate one-layer self-attention with a
fixed decoder. A challenge in this approach is balancing the restriction to shallow transformers (for
analytical tractability) with ensuring that the NTP loss reaches the entropy lower bound. This may
require constraining the training data distribution, for example, to a Markov chain [51, 25].

●Memory capacity in NTP settings: Without imposing further restrictions on the data beyond the
discrete nature of tokens from a finite vocabulary, there is a strong case for investigating the memory
capacity of sequence-to-sequence architectures, such as transformers, in the context of NTP. Recent
studies on transformer memory capacity [40, 41] do not apply here.

●Unconstrained features: Extending the top-down approach, one could consider freely optimizing
context embeddings together with decoder vectors (also known as word embeddings). The resulting
log-bilinear model, reminiscent of wor2vec models [63, 55], extends the unconstrained features model,
which has recently been employed to investigate neural collapse geometry in one-hot classification
settings [56]. This idea offers a promising avenue for uncovering structures in the geometries of
context and word embeddings when learned jointly, potentially revealing new insights into the
capabilities of sufficiently expressive language models (see Fig. 1 for cases involving only the latter).

●Other optimizers: Exploring the NTP implicit bias of adaptive algorithms, such as Adam, poten-
tially building on recent works in this area focused on one-hot classification [96, 95].

We hope this work inspires further research in the discussed directions, contributing to a deeper
understanding of the intricacies involved and potentially yielding improvements in NTP training.

Figure 2: Same setup as Fig. 1. Left: Matrix P of conditional probabilities of words (cols.) per
context (rows). Each row corresponds to the conditional probability vectors pj,j ∈[m]. Black
entries correspond to off-support words. Middle: Shown as wz,z ∈[5], the rows of the NTP-SVM
solution W mm to which GD directionally converges. Right: Shown as wz,z ∈[5], the rows of
the finite parameter W ⋆to which GD iterates projected on F converge to. The geometry of W mm
depends only on the support-set of P . On the other hand, the geometry of W ⋆depends on the entries
of P for in-support tokens/words. As seen from visualization of P , the words 1 and 5 have the same
support pattern (i.e., both follow the same contexts A and B). Thus, w1 = w5 in the Middle plot.
However, on the subspace F corresponding to the Right plot, w1 ≠w5, which allows matching the
different conditional probabilities with which each follows contexts A and B.

Experiments

All experiments were conducted on a MacBook Pro equipped with a 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
processor and 32 GB of memory. The experiments are of relatively small scale and were implemented
in Matlab. The code is straightforward to reproduce, following the detailed specifications provided in
the subsequent sections. For completeness, the code will be made publicly available on Github in the
final version of the paper.

A.1
Additional details on 2D example of Fig. 1

Figure 1 illustrates a toy 2d example where the embeddings and the hyperplanes defined by each row
of W mm can be visualized. We used d = 2,m = 3,V = 5 and S1 = S2 = S3 = 3. The support sets
of each embedding are shown in the figure color-coded to match the respective decoder hyperplane.
Probabilities are assigned randomly. The empirical conditional entropy evaluates to H = 0.8811 and
the matrix of conditional probabilities is visualized in Figure 2. In the same figure, we also visualize
the rows of the directional component W mm (Middle) and of the finite component W ⋆(Right).
Interpreting the V × d decoder matrix as the matrix of learned word embeddings, this provides a
visualization of their geometry. As per our results, the two word-embedding matrices W ⋆and W mm
lie on orthogonal subspaces. The geometry of the first depends on the probabilities of in-support
tokens, while that of the second depends only on the support set of these probabilities. See also
caption of Fig. 2.

A.2
Overparameterized setting

We examine the implicit bias of GD on NTP training with overparameterization on synthetic data
generated as follows. We construct dataset with n = 5000 sequences involving m = 50 distinct
contexts. Each distinct context gets mapped to a randomly generated embedding of dimension
d = 60 > m. We set vocabulary size V = 10 and each context j ∈[m] is followed by Sj = 6,∀j ∈[m]
possible next-tokens. The support sets Sj ⊂V and the probabilities ˆpj,z,z ∈Sj are chosen randomly;
see Fig. 3 for representative examples from the training dataset. For a fixed realization of the dataset
(for which H ≈1.445nats), we run GD, normalized GD (NGD), and Adam from random LeCun
initialization. For GD, we use learning rate η = 0.5 and for NGD and Adam η = 0.01. For Adam,
we also set β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.99. We run all algorithms for 1e4 iterations. For each case, we plot the
following as a function of iterations:

1. Upper Left: CE loss versus entropy lower bound
2. Upper Right: parameter norm growth

17


---Page Break---
3. Lower Left: correlation of W mm with iterates Wk and of “corrected” iterates Wk −W ⋆
after substracting the component on H

4. Lower Right: convergence of the subspace component Wk,F = PF(Wk).

Fig. 4 shows an instance of these. As predicted by our analysis, in this overparameterized setting: CE
loss converges to its lower-bound, parameter norm increases, iterates align in direction with W mm,
and the subspace component converges to W ⋆.

Figure 3: Eight randomly picked contexts with their associated next-token empirical conditional
probabilities ˆpj. The indices shown on the x-axis define the support set Sj of each context.

Figure 5 illustrates the same plots, but this time for training over the same dataset with NGD and
Adam. We observe same implicit bias, but faster convergence. For NGD, this is consistent with
analogous findings (rigorous in that case) for one-hot classification [60, 36].

Additional related work

Implicit bias in transformers. As already mentioned in Sec. 6, our work is closely related to [82],
where the authors investigate the implicit bias of self-attention in transformers. The insight put forth
in the prequel [83] is that softmax attention induces implicit-bias behaviors that bear similarities to
vanilla implicit bias of one-hot prediction. Concretely, [82] studies GD optimization of one-layer
self-attention with fixed decoder and one-hot binary classification. They show that, in the limit, GD
finds attention weights that converge in direction to the solution of an SVM problem that separates
optimal tokens from non-optimal ones. Their non-convex setting introduces locally optimal SVM
directions to which GD may converge depending on initialization. Different to them, the NTP setting
that we study involves predictions over multiple categories and is not one-hot. Also, while they fix
the decoder, here, we fix the embeddings. In these respects their results are rather different. More
similarities arise when [82] replace the linear decoder with a MLP, which they note can induce
multiple optimal tokens per sequence. This leads them to formulate a more general token-separating
SVM program, which similar to ours confines the separation on a certain data subspace. However,
the operational nature of the programs remains different as theirs optimizes attention weights and
separates tokens within a sequence, while ours optimizes decoder weights and separates context
embeddings based on their respective support sets. More importantly, while [82] only conjectures
the convergence of GD to their general SVM program, we leverage convexity in our setting to prove
an analogous statement rigorously. Eventually, as we move lower in our top-down approach and
consider architecture-specific embeddings generated by attention, we anticipate to see integration of
our ideas with theirs.

Beyond [82], there is growing recent research investigating optimization and generalization principles
of transformers, e.g., [70, 24, 48, 93, 99, 1, 45, 83, 82, 84, 17]. These efforts predominantly employ a
‘bottom-up’ approach that involves isolating shallow transformers, often with simplifications such as
removing MLPs, utilizing single heads instead of multiple, and fixing certain parts while training only
a subset of trainable parameters. Most of these studies have focused on classical one-hot supervised
settings, and only a handful (e.g., [84, 85]) have seeked extending these ’bottom-up’ analyses to
NTP settings. Yet, their primary emphasis remains on uncovering the role of attention and how
attention weights evolve during training. Instead, our approach uniquely emphasizes the NTP training
paradigm itself, shifting the focus from the intricacies of specific transformer architectures.

Upon completing this paper, we became aware of independent contemporaneous research by Li et al.
[46] that also examines the implicit bias of self-attention with a fixed linear decoder in next-token
prediction scenarios. Unlike our study which utilizes the widely adopted CE loss, their approach is
based on log-loss, which renders the training loss convex, a similarity shared with our model despite
the inclusion of self-attention. Both our results and those of Li et al. substantiate the conjecture
posited by Tarzanagh and colleagues [82], albeit in very distinct settings. Notably, contrary to both

19


---Page Break---
[83] and [46], we unveil the optimization intricacies of the NTP paradigm, even within the simplest
linear settings.

Classification with soft labels. Unlike one-hot classification, soft-label classification associates each
example with a probability vector, where each entry represents the likelihood of a corresponding
label characterizing the example. Although arguably less prevalent than one-hot (or hard-label)
classification, soft-label classification arises in various contexts, including modeling human confusion
during crowd-sourcing [65, 75, 18], knowledge distillation [32], label smoothing [79], and mixup
[98]. Our model of last-token prediction also falls within this setting. Specifically, our approach
is most closely related to soft-labels generated by averaging annotators’ hard labels [65], rather
than following the winner-takes-all rule to assign labels. [65] and follow-up work have provided
empirical evidence that using probabilistic soft labels generated from crowd annotations for training
leads to improved performance in terms of model generalization, calibration, and robustness to
out-of-distribution data. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has investigated the implicit
bias of gradient descent in this or other soft-label classification settings; thus, our results are of direct
relevance to these contexts as well.

C
Autoregressive setting

For concreteness and simplified notation, in the paper’s main body we focus on NTP over sequences
of fixed length. We show here that this encompasses the autoregressive (i.e., sequential) setting with
minimal changes. This also emphasizes the role played in our results by the sequence length.

As pointed in (1), the full autoregressive NTP objective averages T individual losses (without loss of
generality assume sequences of equal maximum length T). In order to make our analysis applicable,
we first need to express (1) in terms of unique contexts. Mirroring the notations in Sec. 2, define the
following for t ∈[T −1]:

• mt,t ∈[T −1] is the number of distinct contexts of size t. Note that m1 ≥m2 ≥⋯≥mT −1.

• m = ∑T −1
t=1 mt is the total number of distinct contexts in the dataset
• ¯ht,j ∶= hθ(¯xj,t),t ∈[T −1],j ∈[mt] is the embedding of the j-th (among all t-long contexts)
distinct context ¯xj,t.
• ˆπj,t is the empirical probability of ¯xj,t.
• ˆpj,t,z is the empirical probability that context ¯xj,t is followed by token z ∈V.
• Sj,t is the support set of the next-token distribution of context ¯xj,t.

With this notation, the NTP objective becomes

CE = −
∑
t∈[T −1]
∑
j∈[mt]
ˆπt,j ∑
z∈Sj,t
ˆpt,j,z log (Sz(W ¯ht,j)) .

To continue enumerate the multi-set I ∶= {i = (j,t)∣t ∈[T −1],j ∈[mt]}. We may then rewrite the
above as

CE = −∑
i∈I
ˆπi ∑
z∈Si
ˆpi,z log (Sz(W ¯hi)) .

At this point note that this is of identical form to (2). Consequently, the definitions (e.g., NTP-
separability, NTP-margin) and results derived in the main body for sequences of fixed length are
applicable to the AR setting, extending mutatis mutandis.
Remark 2 (The role of sequence length.). Despite the above reduction of the AR setting to the
fixed-length setting, it is crucial to recognize that sequence length remains a significant factor in
the AR model. Specifically, it influences the formulation through support sets and their associated
probabilities. As sequences extend in length, their corresponding support sets generally become
sparser, indicative of less ambiguity in predicting the next token. This dynamic is captured by
Shannon’s inequality,

Ht ≥Ht+1, where Ht = −∑
j∈[mt]
∑
z∈Sℓ
t,j
πt,j ˆpt,j,z log(ˆpt,j,z),

reflecting the incremental reduction in entropy as sequence length increases.

Throughout, lowercase and uppercase bold letters (e.g., a and A) represent vectors and matrices,
respectively. ⟨⋅,⋅⟩and ∥⋅∥denote Euclidean inner product and norm, respectively. For matrix A, we
denote its pseudoinverse as A†. All logarithms are natural logarithms (base e). We denote ev the v-th
standard basis vector in RV . ∆V −1 denotes the V -dimensional unit simplex and S() ∶RV →∆V −1
the softmax map:

S(a) = [S1(a),...,SV (a)]⊺,
with Sv(a) =

∑v′∈[V ] ee⊺
v′a .

As explained in Section 2 we represent a training set as

Tm ∶= {(¯hj, ˆπj, ˆpj,z∈V)}j∈[m] .

We assume that embeddings are bounded and denote

M ∶=
√

2 max
j∈[m]∥¯hj∥.

Given Tm, let
F = span({(ez −ez′)¯h⊺
j ∶z ≠z′ ∈Sj,j ∈[m]})

a subspace of V × d matrices and F⊥its orthogonal complement. Denote PF,P⊥the orthogonal
projections onto F and F⊥, respectively. For convenience, for W ∈RV ×d, we denote

WF ∶= PF(W )
and
W⊥= P⊥(W ).

Define

CEF(W ) = ∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log (1 + ∑

Clearly, for all W ∈RV ×d, it holds CE(W ) ≥CEF(W ). Note also that for all W ∈F and for all
W d ∈F⊥that satisfy Eq. (6a), it holds CEF(W ) = limR→∞CE(W + RW d). Thus, under NTP
compatibility and NTP separability,

W ∈F CEF(W ) = inf
W CE(W ) = H.

Proofs

E.1
Gradient Descent

Throughout we assume GD is ran with step-size η ≤1/(2L) where L is the smoothness of CE loss.
This condition is not explicitly mentioned thereafter.

E.1.1
Auxiliary Lemmata

The following result follows from standard optimization analysis for smooth convex functions
specialized to functions that do not attain their infimum. The version presented here is adopted from
Lemma 2 in [37].
Lemma 3. It holds
lim
k→∞CE(Wk) = inf
W CE(W )

and also limk→∞∥Wk∥= ∞.

In the lemma below, we collect some useful and simple-to-show properties of the GD and regular-
ization paths. These are adaptations of corresponding results for one-hot binary classification over
general non-separable data established in [34].
Lemma 4. Suppose conditions (6) hold for some W d. Also, that there exists W p = W ⋆∈F
satisfying condition (4). The following hold:

21


---Page Break---
1. CEF(W ⋆) = infW ∈F CEF(W ) = H,

2. W ⋆is the unique minimizer of CEF on the subspace F,

3. limk→∞PF(Wk) = W ⋆, where Wk are GD iterates,

4. limk→∞∥P⊥(Wk)∥= ∞,

5. limB→∞PF(̂
WB) = W ⋆, where ̂
WB is the reguarlized solution (8),

6. limB→∞∥P⊥(̂
WB)∥= ∞.

Proof. It is easy to check by direct substitution of W ⋆in (12) and use of (4) that CEF(W ⋆) = H.
This and (13) show the first claim.

The first claim shows W ⋆is a minimizer. Suppose for the sake of contradiction there is a different
minimizer W ⋆≠W1 ∈F. Then, since CEF(W1) = H, it also holds for WR ∶= W1 + RW d that
limR→∞CE(WR) = H. In turn, this implies for all j ∈[m]:

lim
R→∞Sz(WR¯hj) = ˆpj,z,∀z ∈Sj ,
and
lim
R→∞Sv(WR¯hj) = 0,∀v ∉Sj .

The first condition gives then that W1 must satisfy (4). Since W ⋆also satisfies these equations,
denoting W∆= W ⋆−W1 ≠0, it holds:

⟨W∆,(ez −ez′)⊺¯hj)⟩= 0, ∀j ∈[m],z ≠z′ ∈Sj.

But W∆∈F, so this forms a contradiction. Hence, W ⋆is unique solution in F of (4) and unique
minimizer of CEF on the subspace F.

The proof of the third claim follows the same way as the proof of part (1) of Thm. 15 of [37].
For completeness: It follows by the lemma’s assumptions and Lemma 3 that limk→∞CE(Wk) =
H. Combining with the first claim of the lemma yields limk→∞CE(Wk) = CEF(W ⋆). Since
CEF(Wk) ≤CE(Wk), this finally gives

lim
k→∞CEF(Wk) = lim
k→∞CEF (PF(Wk)) = CEF(W ⋆).

Since W ⋆is unique by the second claim, the desired then follows.

For the fourth claim, recall from Lemma 3 that limk→∞∥Wk∥= ∞. From the previous claim, we also
have limk→∞∥PF(Wk)∥< C for some constant C > ∥W ⋆∥. Thus, the desired follows by applying
the fact that ∥Wk∥= ∥PF(Wk)∥+ ∥P⊥(Wk)∥.

The proof of the last two claim is exactly same as that of the third and fourth claim. Only now use the
facts that limB→∞CE(WB) = H and limB→∞∥WB∥= ∞(see proof of Theorem 1).

E.1.2
Key Lemma

Lemma 5. Let Wk denote the GD iterate at iteration k. Recall the decomposition Wk = PF(Wk) +
P⊥(Wk) = Wk,F + Wk,⊥. Fix any α ∈(0,1). There exists large enough R = R(α) and k0 = k0(R)
such that for any k ≥k0, it holds that ∥Wk,⊥∥≥R and

CE(Wk,F + (1 + α)∥Wk,⊥∥W mm ) ≤CE(Wk).
(14)

Proof. We drop the subscript k to lighten notation.

First, note by Lemma 4.D that, for arbitrary R, we can pick k1 = k1(R) such that for all k ≥k1:
∥W⊥∥≥R.

22


---Page Break---
Thus next, we will prove the main claim, i.e. for large enough ∥W⊥∥inequality (14) holds. Denote
R′ =
∥W⊥∥
∥W mm∥. Substituting in CE expression (2), and using the fact that W mm ∈F⊥by (6a) yield:

CE(WF + (1 + α)R′W mm )

= ∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log ⎛
⎝∑
z′∈Sj

⎝∑
v∈V
e−(ez−ev)⊺WF ¯hj + ∑
v∉Sj
e−(1+α)R′(ez−ev)⊺W mm¯hj⎞
⎠.
(15)

Moreover, decomposing W = WF + W⊥, and defining

̃
W⊥∶= ∥W mm∥

∥W⊥∥W⊥= 1

RW⊥,

we have

CE(W ) = ∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log ⎛
⎝∑
z′∈Sj
e−(ez−ez′)⊺WF ¯hj + ∑

⎠

j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑

⎝∑
v∈V

v∉Sj
e−R′(ez−ev)⊺̃

⎠,
(16)

where we used that, by definition, W⊥∈F⊥. Thus, our goal becomes showing (15) ≤(16), for large
enough R. To do this, we consider two cases as follows below.

For the remaining of the proof recall M ∶= maxj∈[m]
√

2∥¯hj∥and use the logits shorthand:

̃ℓj,v = e⊺
v ̃
W⊥¯hj
and
ℓmm
j,v = e⊺
vW mm¯hj .

Case 1: W⊥is well aligned with W mm. Suppose

∥W mm −̃
W⊥∥≤ϵ ∶= α

M .
(17)

Using this, linearity of logits, and Cauchy-Schwartz, yields

̃ℓj,z −̃ℓj,v ≤ℓmm
j,z −ℓmm
j,v + ϵM, ∀j ∈[m],z ∈Sj,v ∉Sj .

Thus,

∑
v∉Sj
e−R′(ez−ev)⊺̃
W⊥¯hj ≥e−ϵMR′
∑
v∉Sj
e−R′(ez−ev)⊺W mm¯hj = e−αR′
∑
v∉Sj
e−R′(ez−ev)⊺W mm¯hj

Also recall by feasibility of W mm that

ℓmm
j,z −ℓmm
j,v ≥1,∀j ∈[m],z ∈Sj,v ∉Sj .
(18)

Thus,

Comparing the above two displays yields

∑
v∉Sj
e−(1+α)R′(ez−ev)⊺̃
W⊥¯hj ≤∑
v∉Sj
e−R′(ez−ev)⊺̃
W⊥¯hj,

which implies the desired (15)≤(16) for any value of R′ (eqv. ∥W⊥∥).

Case 2: No alignment. Suppose now that (17) does not hold. Note that ∥̃
W⊥∥= ∥W mm∥and since
(NTP-SVM) has a unique solution it must be that ̃
W⊥is not feasible. But ̃
W⊥∈F⊥, thus it satisfies
the equality constraints. This then means that there exist δ ∶= δ(ϵ) and j⋆∈[m],v⋆∉Sj⋆such that

̃ℓj⋆,z −̃ℓj⋆,v⋆≤1 −δ , ∀z ∈Sj⋆.
(19)

(Note the above holds for all z ∈Sj⋆because ̃ℓj⋆,z = ̃ℓj⋆,z′ since ̃
W⊥∈F⊥.)

To continue, we introduce the shorthand notation

Aj,z ∶= Aj,z(W ) = ∑
v∈V
e−(ez−ev)⊺WF ¯hj

as well as
Amin ∶=
min
j∈[m],z∈Sj Aj,z,
and
Amax ∶=

Using (19) we may lower bound (16) as follows:

where in the last line we used ˆπj ≥1/n,∀j ∈[m] as well as log(1 + x) ≥

1+x,x > 0.

On the other hand, using property (18) for max-margin logits, we can upper bound (15) as follows:

CE(WF + (1 + α)R′W mm ) −∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj

≤V e−R′(1+α)

Amin

where in the last line we used log(1 + x) ≤x,x > 0.

In view of the two last displays, it suffices that

V e−R′(1+α)

Amin
≤
e−R′(1−δ)

n(Amax + 1)
⇐⇒R′ ≥
1
δ + α log (nV (Amax + 1)

Amin
) .

All it remains is obtaining bounds for Amin,Amax specifically showing that they do not depend on R.
By Cauchy-Schwartz:
V e−M∥WF∥≤Amin ≤Amax ≤V eM∥WF∥

Further recall by Lemma 4.C that if k is large enough then

∥WF −W ⋆∥≤∥W ⋆∥Ô⇒∥WF∥≤2∥W ⋆∥.
(22)

Thus, there exists k⋆= k⋆(∥W⋆∥) such that for all k ≥k⋆:

V e−2M∥W⋆∥≤Amin ≤Amax ≤V e2M∥W⋆∥.

Hence, the desired (21)≤(20) holds provided

∥W⊥∥≥∥W mm∥

α
log (2nV e4∥W ⋆∥) .
(23)

Set R = R(α) = {RHS of (23)} and k0(R) ∶= max{k1(R),k⋆}. We have shown this guarantees for
all k ≥k0: ∥W⊥∥≥R and by choice of R also (21)≤(20). This in turn implies (15)≤(16), as desired
to complete the proof.

E.1.3
Proof of Theorem 2

For the subspace component, see Lemma 4.C. For the directional convergence, the key ingredient of
the proof is Lemma 5. After that, the proof follows identically to Thm. 15(2) in [37]. We include the
details for completeness, but there are no novel aspects in the rest of this section.

24


---Page Break---
Let any ϵ ∈(0,1) and choose α = ϵ/(1 −ϵ). By Lemma 5, there exists k0 such that for any k ≥k0,
we have
∥Wk,⊥∥≥max{R(α),1/2}
and

⟨∇CE(Wk),Wk,⊥−(1 + α)∥Wk,⊥∥W mm⟩= ⟨∇CE(Wk),Wk −(Wk,F + (1 + α)∥Wk,⊥∥W mm)⟩

≥CE(Wk) −CE(Wk,F + (1 + α)∥Wk,⊥∥W mm) ≥0,

where we also used convexity of the loss.

Consequently,

⟨Wk+1 −Wk,W mm⟩= ⟨−η∇CE(Wk),W mm⟩

≥(1 −ϵ)⟨−η∇CE(Wk),Wk,⊥⟩

≥(1 −ϵ)⟨Wk+1,⊥−Wk,⊥,Wk,⊥⟩

≥(1 −ϵ)(∥Wk+1,⊥∥−∥Wk,⊥∥−2η(CE(Wk,⊥) −CE(Wk+1,⊥)),

where the last step used ∥Wk,⊥∥≥1/2, the fact that x2 −y2 ≥2y(x −y),∀x,y and smoothness of
the CE loss.

Telescoping the above expression and rearranging yields

⟨W k,W mm⟩≥(1 −ϵ)∥Wk,⊥∥

∥Wk∥−⟨Wk0,W mm⟩−(1 −ϵ)∥wk0,⊥∥−η CE(Wk0)

∥Wk∥

≥(1 −ϵ) −∥Wk,F∥2 + ⟨Wk0,W mm⟩−(1 −ϵ)∥wk0,⊥∥−η CE(Wk0)

∥Wk∥

Now recall from Lemma 4 that limk→∞∥Wk∥= ∞and limk→∞∥Wk,F∥= ∥W ⋆∥. Thus,
liminfk→∞⟨W k,W mm⟩≥1 −ϵ. Since ϵ is arbitrary, the desired follows.

E.2
Regularization Path

We provide a detailed proof of Theorem 1 filling in missing details from the proof sketch in the main
paper.

E.2.1
Proof of Theorem 1

First, we show that ̂
WB is on the boundary, i.e. ∥̂
WB∥= B. Suppose not, then ⟨∇CE(̂
WB),U⟩= 0
for all U ∈RV ×d. Using the CE expression in (2) and a few algebraic manipulations, yields

⟨−∇CE(̂
WB),U⟩= ∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z( ∑

z′∈Sj
z′≠z

sj,z′ (ez −ez′)⊺U ¯hj + ∑
v∉Sj
sj,v (ez −ev)⊺U ¯hj), (24)

where we denote the output probabilities at ̂
WB as sj,v ∶= Sv(̂
WB¯hj),v ∈V,j ∈[m]. Choose
U = W mm in (24). Then, the first term in the parenthesis in (24) is zero by (6a), while the second
term is strictly positive by (6b) and strict positivity of softmax entries, leading to contradiction.

Now, consider point W ⋆
B = W ⋆+ R(B) ⋅W mm, where, W ⋆∈F satisfies (4), and R = R(B) is
chosen such that ∥W ⋆
B∥= B. Concretely, for B > ∥W ⋆∥, set

R =
1
∥W mm∥

√

B2 −∥W ⋆∥2.

Note also that R/B →1/∥W mm∥as B →∞. We will show that W ⋆
B attains a small CE loss as B
(hence, R) grows. To do this, denote for convenience the logits for all v ∈V,j ∈[m] ∶

ℓ⋆
j,v ∶= e⊺
vW ⋆¯hj
and
ℓmm
j,v ∶= e⊺
vW mm¯hj ,

25


---Page Break---
and note that e⊺
vW ⋆
B¯hj = ℓ⋆
j,v + R ℓmm
j,v . By using (4) and (6a):

∑
z′∈Sj
e−(ℓ⋆
j,z+Rℓmm
j,z −ℓ⋆
j,z′−Rℓmm
j,z′) = 1

ˆpj
.

Moreover, using (6b)

∑
v∉Sj
e−(ℓ⋆
j,z+Rℓmm
j,z −ℓ⋆
j,v−Rℓmm
j,v ) ≤e−R ∑
v∉Sj
e−(ℓ⋆
j,z−ℓ⋆
j,v) ≤C e−R,

where we define constant (independent of R) C ∶= V e∥W ⋆∥M, for M ∶=
√

2 ⋅maxj/∈[m] ∥¯hj∥.

Combining the above displays and using in Eq. (2), yields

CE(W ⋆
B) ≤∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log ( 1

ˆpj,z
+ C e−R) ≤∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z(log ( 1

ˆpj,z
) + ˆpj,zC e−R)

≤H + C e−R ,
(25)

where, the second line uses log(1 + x) ≤x,x > 0, and the third line uses ˆπj, ˆpj,z are probabilities.

Next, towards arriving at a contradiction, we will show that if ̂
WB is not in the direction of W mm,
then it incurs a loss that is larger than CE(W ⋆
B). Concretely, assuming the statement of the theorem
is not true, we we will upper bound

CE(̂
WB) −H = ∑
j∈[m]
ˆπj ∑
z∈Sj
ˆpj,z log (
ˆpj,z
Sz(̂
WB¯hj)
).
(26)

By our assumption, there exists ϵ > 0, such that there exists arbitrarily large B satisfying:

∥∥W mm∥

B
̂
WB −W mm∥> ϵ.
(27)

Define
̂
W =
1
R′(B)(̂
WB −W ⋆),

where, R′ = R′(B) > 0 is chosen so that ∥̂
W ∥= ∥W mm∥. Concretely, for large enough B ≥2∥W ⋆∥,
set
R′ =
1
∥W mm∥

√

B2 −2B⟨WB,W ⋆⟩+ ∥W ⋆∥2 .

Note that it holds limB→∞R′/B = 1/∥W mm∥. Thus, we can always choose B large enough so that
Eq. (27) guarantees ∥̂
W −W mm∥≥ϵ′, for some ϵ′ > 0. Since W mm is the unique minimizer of
(NTP-SVM) and ∥̂
W ∥= ∥W mm∥, it follows that there exists δ ∈(0,1) and j ∈[m] such that at least
one of the following is true

(i) ∃z and z′ ≠z ∈Sj such that

∣(ez −ez′)⊺̂
W ¯hj∣≥δ ,
(28)

(ii) ∃z ∈Sj,v ∉Sj such that

(ez −ev)⊺̂
W ¯hj ≤1 −δ.
(29)

Case (i): Without loss of generality (ez −ez′)⊺̂
W ¯hj ≤−δ (otherwise, flip z,z′). Thus, ignoring all
but one term in (26) gives

CE(̂
WB) −H ≥ˆπj ˆpj,z log (
ˆpj,z
Sz(̂
WB¯hj)
) ≥ˆπj ˆpj,z log (ˆpj,ze(ℓj,z′−ℓj,z)),
(30)

where we use ℓj,v = e⊺
v ̂
WB¯hj,v ∈V to denote logits of ̂
WB. Using (4) and (28), yields

ℓj,z′ −ℓj,z = (ez′ −ez)⊺(R′ ̂
W + W ⋆) ¯hj ≥R′δ + log ( ˆpj,z′

ˆpj,z
) .

26


---Page Break---
Put in (26) and using ˆpj,z ≥ˆπj ˆpj,z ≥1/n shows

CE(̂
WB) ≥H + 1

n log (eR′δ

n
)

Compare this with (25). For large enough B, it is clear that ˆπj ˆpj,z log (ˆpj,z ceR′δ) > Ce−R. Thus,

CE(̂
WB) > CE(W ⋆
B), a contradiction.

Case (ii): We can assume ̂
W ∈F⊥, since otherwise we are in Case (i). Now, again ignoring all but
the (j,z) term in the CE loss for which (29) holds for some v ∉Sj, we find

CE(̂
WB) −H ≥ˆπj ˆpj,z log (ˆpj,z( ∑
z′∈Sj
e(ℓj,z′−ℓj,z) + e(ℓj,v−ℓj,z))).

Using PT (̂
WB) = W ⋆yields

∑
z′∈Sj
e(ℓj,z′−ℓj,z) = ∑
z′∈Sj

ˆpj,z′

ˆpj,z
=
1
ˆpj,z
.

Moreover, by (29):
eℓj,v−ℓj,z ≥e−R′(1−δ) eℓ⋆
j,v−ℓ⋆
j,z ≥c′e−R′(1−δ),

for constant (independent of B) c′ ∶= e−∥W ⋆∥M. Putting the above together yield:

CE(̂
WB) −H ≥ˆπj ˆpj,z log (1 + ˆpj,zc′e−R′(1−δ)) ≥c′e−R′(1−δ)

2n2
.

where the second inequality uses log(1 + x) ≥
x
1+x,x > 0.

Compare this with (25).
For large enough B, (recall R,R′ grow at the same rate) it holds
c′

2n2 e−R′(1−δ) > Ce−R. Thus, CE(̂
WB) > CE(W ⋆
B), a contradiction.

In either case, we arrive at a contradiction, which completes the proof.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Sec. 2-5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Sec. 7

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

28


---Page Break---
Justification: Detailed proofs of all results provided in Sec. E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Sec. A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether
the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

29


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: As mentioned in Sec. A: the code is straightforward to reproduce, following
the detailed specifications provided in the same section. For completeness, the code will be
made publicly available online in the final version of the paper.
Guidelines: As mentioned in Sec. A

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Sec. A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We use deterministic full-batch optimization in the experiments starting from
zero initialization.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the
main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

30


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Sec. A

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special considera-
tion due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper involves foundational research on the optimization properties of
next-token prediction, that has the potential to enable better understanding of operating
regimes of language models with respect to optimization, generalization and robustness.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

31


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

32


---Page Break---
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
