Abstract

Recent open-world 3D representation learning methods using Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to align 3D point clouds with image-text information have shown
superior 3D zero-shot performance. However, CAD-rendered images for this align-
ment often lack realism and texture variation, compromising alignment robustness.
Moreover, the volume discrepancy between 3D and 2D pretraining datasets high-
lights the need for effective strategies to transfer the representational abilities of
VLMs to 3D learning. In this paper, we present OpenDlign, a novel open-world
3D model using depth-aligned images generated from a diffusion model for robust
multimodal alignment. These images exhibit greater texture diversity than CAD
renderings due to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model. By refining the
depth map projection pipeline and designing depth-specific prompts, OpenDlign
leverages rich knowledge in pre-trained VLM for 3D representation learning with
streamlined fine-tuning. Our experiments show that OpenDlign achieves high
zero-shot and few-shot performance on diverse 3D tasks, despite only fine-tuning
6 million parameters on a limited ShapeNet dataset. In zero-shot classification,
OpenDlign surpasses previous models by 8.0% on ModelNet40 and 16.4% on Om-
niObject3D. Additionally, using depth-aligned images for multimodal alignment
consistently enhances the performance of other state-of-the-art models.

Introduction

3D understanding, including tasks like 3D object classification [1, 2], 3D scene segmentation
[3], and 3D reconstruction [4, 5], is becoming increasingly pivotal in real-world applications like
augmented/virtual reality [6, 7], autonomous vehicles [8]. Traditional 3D models [1, 2, 9, 10, 11]
are closed-world, recognizing only pre-defined categories and struggling with ‘unseen’ ones. Recent
studies aim to leverage Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP [12]) to develop open-world 3D models
that generalize beyond ‘seen’ 3D data, enabling zero-shot handling of various 3D tasks.

Existing open-world 3D learning methods can be classified into depth-based and point-based ap-
proaches. Depth-based methods [13, 14, 15] convert point clouds into multi-view depth maps and
use the pre-trained CLIP image encoder for 3D representations. A significant challenge is the domain
gap since CLIP is pre-trained on RGB images, not depth maps. To mitigate this gap, methods like
[15] introduce an additional depth encoder to align depth features with the image and text features
from the pre-trained CLIP encoders, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The images used for feature alignment are
produced by rendering synthetic CAD models from various camera viewpoints. Point-based methods
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20] directly extract 3D representations from point clouds, thereby bypassing the need
for depth map projection. However, they also require an extra point encoder for feature alignment to
address format disparities between images and point clouds, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Thus, employing

Figure 1: Top: Comparison of OpenDlign with traditional open-world 3D learning models. Depth-

to align with CAD-rendered images. Conversely, OpenDlign (c) fine-tunes only the image encoder,
aligning with vividly colored and textured depth-aligned images for enhanced 3D representation. Both
rendered and depth-aligned images are utilized solely during training. Bottom: Visual comparison
between multi-view CAD-rendered and corresponding depth-aligned images in OpenDlign.

an extra 3D encoder for multimodal feature alignment of 3D data, CAD-rendered images, and text
modalities is a standard practice in modern open-world 3D learning methods.

Despite widespread usage, we argue that CAD-rendered images fall short of providing the visual
diversity and realism necessary for robust multimodal alignment. This limitation arises because CAD
models in current open-source datasets [21, 22] often feature simplistic or entirely absent textures.
These models also struggle to realistically simulate environmental effects like lighting, shadows, and
reflections. Moreover, most CAD models maintain visual coherence across viewpoints, leading to
overly consistent textures and colors from all angles. To achieve generalizable 3D representations,
each image view for alignment is expected to display significant visual variations (See Fig. 1).

Additionally, pretraining an extra 3D encoder for alignment may not fully leverage the rich knowledge
in CLIP for 3D understanding due to the significant volume discrepancy between 2D and 3D pre-
training datasets. Mainstream 3D datasets like ShapeNet [21] and Objaverse [23] contain fewer than
1 million synthetic 3D objects, significantly less than the vast image datasets such as DFN5B [24]
and LAION-5B [25], which include around 5 billion images used to train cutting-edge CLIP models.
While direct fine-tuning of CLIP’s encoders facilitates more straightforward knowledge transfer, it
restricts inputs to depth maps. Yet, developing 3D representations from depth maps is currently less
effective than from point clouds for two primary reasons: (1) The current widely used CLIP text
prompt templates are tailored for matching with RGB images, not depth maps, and (2) the lack of a
robust projection method for creating dense depth maps with smooth contours from point clouds.

In this paper, we present OpenDlign, the first 3D open-world framework that develops 3D rep-
resentation by aligning with multi-view diffusion model-generated images, termed depth-aligned
images. These images benefit from the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, offering greater
texture diversity compared to CAD renderings while maintaining the original 3D data’s geometric
and semantic integrity (See Fig. 1). Remarkably, OpenDlign demonstrates competitive open-world
capability by fine-tuning only 6 million parameters of the CLIP image encoder on ShapeNet [21],
unleashing CLIP’s vast potential in 3D learning (See Fig. 1(c)). The success of this fine-tuning
stems from refining the depth map projection pipeline, developing depth-specific text prompts, and
introducing a logit aggregation strategy to merge multi-view prediction results. Experimental results
reveal that OpenDlign significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on a variety

of 3D tasks, including zero-shot/few-shot classification, object detection, and cross-modal retrieval.
In zero-shot classification, OpenDlign achieves accuracy improvements of 8.0% on ModelNet40 and
16.4% on OmniObject3D, the largest real-world 3D shape dataset. Additionally, depth-aligned images
markedly enhance the performance of SOTA models, consistently improving results across diverse
benchmarks and highlighting their transformative impact on open-world 3D learning pipelines.

The main contributions of this paper are outlined as follows:

• We introduce depth-aligned images as a robust alternative to CAD-rendered images for
open-world 3D learning. These images, generated from point cloud-projected depth maps
using a diffusion model, offer rich and realistic texture diversity across viewpoints.

• We propose a multimodal alignment framework that robustly aligns depth maps, depth-
aligned images, and text through streamlined fine-tuning of the CLIP image encoder.

• We develop a contour-aware projection pipeline to produce dense and contour-preserving
multi-view depth maps from point clouds.

• We present depth-specific text prompts and a logit aggregation strategy to boost OpenDlign’s
zero-shot capabilities and mitigate catastrophic forgetting during alignment fine-tuning.

2.1
Open-World 3D Representation Learning

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP [12] have revolutionized 2D representation learning
in open-world settings through contrastive learning with large-scale image-text pairs [26, 27, 28,
29]. Building on this, recent studies have adapted CLIP for 3D representation learning, achieving
impressive performance in diverse 3D zero-shot tasks [18, 19].

PointCLIP [14], as a pioneering study, utilizes the CLIP image encoder for extracting 3D repre-
sentations from depth maps of point clouds, achieving zero-shot recognition by aligning with text
embeddings of semantic categories. To address CLIP’s training bias towards RGB images, Zhu et
al. [13] introduced GPT-generated 3D-specific prompts and a denser depth map projection, while
CLIP2Point [15] pre-trains a depth encoder for closer alignment with CLIP’s encoders. These meth-
ods derive representations from depth maps with noisy contours, causing a loss of key shape features
needed for precise recognition. Moreover, their reliance on either natural image text prompts or
depth-specific prompts generated by GPT-3 [30] for certain categories highlights a lack of versatility
in handling diverse 3D contexts. Alternative methods [17, 18, 19, 20] avoid depth map projection by
directly aligning point clouds, images, and text using specialized 3D encoders. By scaling up the
dataset and encoder sizes, these methods show promise in diverse 3D tasks. However, these methods
are limited by their reliance on CAD-rendered images, which have limited texture diversity across
views, leading to less generalizable representations. Additionally, the smaller volume of 3D datasets
compared to CLIP’s training data hinders effective knowledge transfer to point cloud encoders.

In this paper, we substitute rendered images with depth-aligned images generated from a diffusion
model to enhance texture diversity. We also fine-tune the CLIP image encoder for 3D representation
learning instead of training a new 3D encoder from scratch, reducing the reliance on large 3D datasets.

2.2
Continual Learning in CLIP Fine-Tuning

Continual Learning (CL) in CLIP aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting [31], ensuring retention of
zero-shot capabilities across varied data distributions while fine-tuning to new tasks. CL methods fall
into three categories: adaptive-plasticity methods [32, 33], replay methods [34, 35], and architecture-
based methods [36, 37]. Adaptive-plasticity methods limit the plasticity of the essential model
parameters for past tasks during fine-tuning. For instance, the IMM-Mean [38] method achieves
CL by simply averaging parameters of pre-trained and fine-tuned models for inference, although
its efficacy might be limited for complex tasks [39]. Replay methods leverage stored exemplars to
enable CLIP to recall previously learned knowledge, while they encounter scalability challenges.
Without relying on exemplars, architecture-based CL methods dynamically adjust the model’s
architecture to accommodate new information without losing existing knowledge [39]. In this study,
we align the depth map with the RGB image by freezing the pre-trained CLIP encoder weights and

3

incorporating a trainable transformer-based branch for encoding depth maps, adhering to architecture-
based principles. Inspired by IMM-Mean [38], we use pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights to
compute classification logits from multi-view depth maps for inference.

Methodology

The OpenDlign framework, depicted in Fig. 2, starts with a contour-aware projection method that
transforms point clouds into multi-view depth maps with preserved contours. These maps guide
a diffusion model to produce depth-aligned images with varied colors and textures, maintaining
consistent geometry with the depth maps. OpenDlign then aligns features from depth maps and depth-
aligned images by fine-tuning a transformer block connected to the pre-trained image encoder. The
goal is to align feature embeddings from depth maps and corresponding depth-aligned images using
contrastive learning. At inference, 3D representations are composed of embeddings from multi-view
depth maps, derived using both fine-tuned and pre-trained encoder states. These embeddings are
matched with depth-specific text embeddings, which capture the semantic and visual properties of
the depth maps, to generate multi-view logits. These logits are then aggregated to facilitate label
prediction in a zero-shot setting. In few-shot scenarios, these embeddings can be further refined with
a logistic regressor. Detailed training and model implementation are provided in Appendix A.2.

3.1
Contour-Aware Depth Map Projection

The contour-aware projection method transforms the input point cloud into multi-view depth maps
with clear contours. Inspired by the pipeline in [13], this method involves four main steps: Quantize,
Densify, Smooth, and Squeeze.

In the Quantize step, for the i^{\text {th}} view of point cloud P_i, the 3D coordinates (x,  y , z ) \in P_i are
normalized to [0, 1] and mapped onto a discrete grid G  \in \mathbb {R}^{H \times W \times B}, where H and W correspond to
the dimensions required by the CLIP image encoder, and B is a pre-defined depth dimension. Next,
the Densify step enhances G by updating each voxel to the maximum value within its 7  \times 7 \times 7
neighborhood, yielding a denser map G'. Subsequently, the Smooth step applies bilateral filtering to
each voxel v_i in G', adjusting its intensity I_{v_i} to I'
_{v_i} using:

  
I' _
{
v_

i

} = 
\frac { 1 }{W_v} \sum _ {v_j \in S} G_{\sigma _1}(\|v_i - v_j\|) G_{\sigma _2}(|I_{v_i} - I_{v_j}|) I_{v_j} 
(1)

where W_ { v

} = \sum _{ v _j \in S} G_{\sigma _1}(\|v_i - v_j\|) G_{\sigma _2}(|I_{v_i} - I_{v_j}|)
is the normalization factor that ensures voxel
weights sum to 1.0. The Gaussian functions Gσ1 and Gσ2 adjust the influence of each neighboring
voxel vj within the 5 × 5 × 5 kernel from set S around vi, based on spatial and intensity differences,
enhancing contour sharpness and reducing jagged edges in G′. Finally, the Squeeze step applies the
minimal pooling on the depth channel of the smoothed G', then triples the output to mimic RGB
intensity, producing the final depth map D ∈RH×W ×3.

3.2
Depth-Aligned Image Generation

A total of 524,700 depth-aligned images are generated from ShapeNet [21], a leading public 3D CAD
dataset containing approximately 52,470 models, each annotated with semantic metadata. To generate
these images, a point cloud of 10,000 points is sampled from each CAD model, aligning with prior
experimental protocols [18, 17]. For each point cloud, 10 views of depth maps are projected using
the proposed contour-aware projection method. Subsequently, the ControlNet v1.1 [40] depth model
produces depth-aligned images for each contour-aware depth map view, using the CAD model’s
metadata as text input and the inverse of the depth map 1

D as image generation control. This approach
ensures that the generated images remain consistent with the depth maps both geometrically and
semantically, while also adding texture diversity across different views. ControlNet utilizes 1

D instead
of D for controlling image outputs because it is predominantly pre-trained on depth images where
brighter regions indicate closer proximity. Please refer to Appendix A.2 for the positive and negative
prompts used in ControlNet to achieve high-fidelity depth-aligned image generation.

Figure 2: Overview of OpenDlign. In (a), OpenDlign converts point clouds into multi-view depth
maps using a contour-aware projection, which then helps generate depth-aligned RGB images
with diverse textures, geometrically and semantically aligned with the maps. A transformer block,
residually connected to the CLIP image encoder, is fine-tuned to align depth maps with depth-
aligned images for robust 3D representation. For zero-shot classification (b), OpenDlign aggregates
multi-view logits from both pre-trained and fine-tuned encoders for label prediction. For few-shot
classification (c), it employs a logistic regressor trained on multi-view features from the encoders.

3.3
Multimodal Representation Alignment

OpenDlign aligns depth maps and depth-aligned images by fine-tuning a transformer block residually
linked to the last block of the CLIP image encoder, using contrastive learning. With CLIP pre-trained
to align images and text, OpenDlign implicitly aligns depth maps with the shared image-text space.

Multimodal Feature Extraction. Given a 3D point cloud input, let  D  = \{
D_i\}_{i=1}^N represent the
set of its  N projected depth map views, and  R  = \{
R_i\}_{i=1}^N the corresponding set of depth-aligned
images. Each image  R_i is encoded through  L layers of a pre-trained CLIP image encoder,  \{\text
 {T}_l(\cdot )\}_{l=1}^L ,
to obtain feature representations  I
^ { R}_{i} =\text {T}_{1\ldots L}(R_i) . Each depth map  D_i is processed up to layer  \text {T}_{L-1} ,
yielding preliminary features  \text {T}_{1\ldots L-1}(D_i) . Subsequently, these depth features are passed through the
frozen layer  \text {T}_L and its trainable counterpart  \
text {T}^t_L , where only the attention layers for spatial interaction
in  \
text {T}^t_L are trainable, as inspired by [41]. This process produces the feature for the ith depth map view

where  k \n eq i, j . τ is a learnable temperature parameter. The contrastive loss enables learning robust
representations by maximizing similarity in positive pairs and minimizing it in negative pairs [42, 43].

3.4
3D Zero-Shot Transfer

The alignment between depth maps and depth-aligned images facilitates 3D zero-shot classification by
aggregating multi-view classification logits. Each logit represents the similarity between single-view
depth features and text features of category candidates, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b).

Depth-Specific Text Generation. Depth-specific prompt templates are developed by augmenting
a base set of 80 text prompts, initially designed for ImageNet classification2, with depth-related
keywords such as "depth map", "raytraced image", and "silhouette of [CLASS]". These keywords
direct OpenDlign’s attention to geometric details and contours rather than color or texture. The CLIP
Interrogator [44] is a prompt engineering tool that combines CLIP and BLIP [45] to select optimal
text prompts for specific images. To identify these keywords, this tool identifies the top 10 prompts
that match depth maps from the ShapeNet dataset [21], chosen as targeted keywords. For zero-shot
inference, we employ our depth-specific templates to generate 80 text descriptions for each label l.
These descriptions {ti}80
i=1 are encoded by a texture encoder F(·), normalized, and then merged into
a unified text feature Fl via average pooling, calculated as
1
80
P80
i=1 ∥F(ti)∥.

Multi-View Logits Aggregation. To calculate classification logits, we first gather visual features
from multi-view depth maps {Vi}N
i=1, aiming to align with depth-specific text features of M candidate
labels F = {Fi}M
i=1. The feature extraction utilizes a dual-encoder strategy: the first half of the views
\ifmmode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi V_i\}_{i=1}^{N/2}
utilize a pre-trained CLIP image encoder, while the second half of the views \ifmmode \lbrace \else \textbraceleft \fi V_i\}_{i=N/2+1}^{N}
employs a fine-tuned encoder. The strategy ensures that OpenDlign maintains its capability to
recognize previously identifiable depth maps after learning multimodal alignment via fine-tuning. As
shown in Fig. 2(b), the logit for a single depth map view is the product of Vi and F, with the overall
classification logit being the sum of logits across all views, calculated as PN
i=1 ViFT .

Experiments

Zero-Shot 3D Classification

We first evaluated OpenDlign under the zero-shot shape classification task on four benchmark
datasets: ModelNet40 [46], ScanObjectNN [47], OmniObject3D [48], and Objaverse-LVIS [23].
ModelNet40 offers synthetic 3D CAD models in 40 categories. ScanObjectNN provides real-scanned
objects in 15 categories from OBJ_ONLY version. OmniObject3D, the largest, includes 5,911 real-
scanned objects in 216 categories, well-suited for fine-grained, real-world classification evaluation.
Objaverse-LVIS contains 1,156 categories for evaluating long-tail classification. Point cloud sizes
are 10,000 points for ModelNet40 and Objaverse-LVIS, 2,048 for ScanObjectNN, and 4,096 for
OmniObject3D. OpenDlign was compared against existing methods, including three depth-based
methods: PointCLIP [14], PointCLIP V2 [13], and CLIP2Point [15], and three point-based methods:
ULIP [17], OpenShape [18], and TAMM [20]. To investigate if depth-aligned images consistently
enhance the representational abilities of other 3D open-world methods, we retrained all OpenShape
and TAMM variants using their original CAD-rendered images and some depth-aligned images. Note

that the depth-aligned images for all model variants were exclusively generated from ShapeNet [21],
while the pretraining CAD-rendered images could come from ShapeNet or a large-scale ensemble
dataset [18] that includes Objaverse [23], ShapeNet [21], 3D-Future [49], and ABO [22]. Furthermore,
we evaluated OpenDlign’s scalability by training it with various CLIP variants.

Table 6 shows OpenDlign substantially outperforms existing methods trained on ShapeNet across all
benchmarks, exceeding the previous best, TAMM-SparseConv, by margins of 8.0% on ModelNet40,
1.6% on ScanObjectNN, and 16.4% on OmniObject3D in Top1 accuracy. Appendix A.5 Table 7

demonstrates OpenDlign’s excellence in handling long-tail categories by outperforming previous
methods by 21.3% on the Objaverse-LVIS dataset. OpenDlign also outperforms the top depth-
based method, PointCLIP V2, by 19% on ModelNet40 and 27.4% on OmniObject3D. Notably,
OpenDlign outshines all methods pre-trained on the ensemble dataset in the ScanObject3D benchmark.
Additionally, its performance increases linearly with the complexity of CLIP variants, outperforming
most baselines on ModelNet40 and OmniObject3D, even using the lighter ViT-B-16 CLIP model.
Remarkably, using depth-aligned images (+dlign) consistently boosts the performance of OpenShape
and TAMM variants pre-trained on the ShapeNet dataset across all benchmarks. Despite depth-
aligned images being available only for ShapeNet, which comprises just 10% of the ensemble dataset,
TAMM-PointBERT (+dlign) shows a 4.8% increase in Top1 accuracy on the ScanObjectNN dataset,
and OpenShape-PointBERT (+dlign) records a 1.6% increase on the OmniObject3D. Note that for
parts of the ensemble dataset without depth-aligned images, we used CAD-rendered images instead.

Few-Shot 3D Classification

We then assessed OpenDlign’s few-shot classification capability by training a logistic regressor with
linear probing on features from N-shot, 10-view depth maps. Similar to the zero-shot scenario,
we extracted multi-view features using both fine-tuned and pre-trained OpenDlign encoders. At

inference, the regressor aggregates logits from 10 views to predict the final label. We compared
OpenDlign with ULIP [17], OpenShape [18], and TAMM [20], which extract features for training
regressor from their point encoders pre-trained on ShapeNet. Table 2 shows OpenDlign outperforms
all baselines across varied few-shot scenarios with 1 to 16 training samples per class. OpenDlign
significantly outperforms the leading baseline on the OmniObject3D dataset, exceeding it by 8.8%
and 11.8% in the 4-shot and 8-shot classification, respectively. See Appendix A.5 for more results.

4.3
Zero-Shot 3D Object Detection

OpenDlign’s capability in zero-shot 3D object detection was evaluated on the ScanNet V2 dataset
[51], which contains richly annotated 3D indoor scenes in 18 object categories. Following the
PointCLIP V2 methodology [13], we started with the pre-trained 3DETR-m [11] model to identify
3D regions of interest, delineate 3D bounding boxes, and extract points within each box. Finally,
we applied OpenDlign to these points to generate our predictions. Table 3 illustrates OpenDlign’s
zero-shot detection prowess using mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.25 and 0.5,
achieving scores of 50.72% and 37.97%, respectively. It significantly outperforms PointCLIP V2 by
more than 31.75% and 26.44%. Remarkably, OpenDlign can detect the ‘Sofa’ shape with an AP50 of
54.96%, whereas PointCLIP and V2 score below 10%, demonstrating OpenDlign’s superior ability
to extract robust 3D representations from sparse and noisy point clouds in real-world indoor scenes.

4.4
Cross-Modal Retrieval

3D shapes were retrieved by computing the cosine similarity between the embeddings of a query and
those generated by OpenDlign, followed by a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) analysis to find the most
similar shapes. Fig. 3 showcases OpenDlign’s ability to match 3D shapes to image and text queries.
Column (a) shows its precision in distinguishing sub-categories like grand versus upright pianos from
image queries. Column (b) demonstrates successful shape retrieval using distinctive text descriptions
like "Batmobile armored". Notably, averaging image and text query embeddings allows OpenDlign
to find shapes that combine elements of both queries. For instance, merging a running horse image
with the text "man" retrieves both a centaur and a running man, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Similarly,
combining a house image with "tree" retrieves a treehouse. See Appendix A.6 for more results.

Ablation Study

Ablation studies were conducted on zero-shot classification benchmarks to assess the contribution of
each component in OpenDlign. Consistently, all OpenDlign variants used in these studies employed
OpenCLIP-ViT-H-14 as their backbone. ShapeNet was the default training dataset for all models.

Contour-Aware Projection. Replacing PointCLIP V2’s projection pipeline [13] with our contour-
aware version enables a pre-trained CLIP to achieve 68.8% zero-shot accuracy on ModelNet40,
outperforming several baselines that require extra training (See Table 4). This indicates that CLIP
can understand RGB images and depth maps when shape features are highlighted.

Effect of Alignment with Depth-Aligned Images. Table 4 shows that aligning depth maps with
depth-aligned images (i.e., depth-dlign) significantly boosts performance, improving Top1 accuracy
by around 10% on ScanObjectNN, with or without depth-specific prompts. This indicates that depth-d
alignment effectively transfers CLIP’s rich knowledge to interpret depth maps.

Further analysis compared depth-dlign alignment against three alternatives: depth-rendCAD (aligning
depth maps with CAD-rendered RGB images), dlign-text & depth (aligning depth-aligned images
with text before depth-dlign alignment), and depth-text & dlign (simultaneous alignment of depth
maps with text and depth-aligned images). Table 5 shows depth-dlign outperforming depth-rendCAD
by 6.8% on the ScanObjectNN dataset, confirming concerns that alignment with rendered images may
lead to overfitting on specific 3D shapes. Moreover, dlign-text & depth performs worst, suggesting
that pre-aligning depth-aligned images with text compromises CLIP’s ability to generate robust image
representations, thus affecting subsequent depth-dlign alignment efficacy. The superior performance
of depth-dlign on ModelNet40 and OmniObject3D compared to depth-text & dlign shows that
aligning depth maps with depth-aligned images indirectly aligns with text, making additional text
alignment unnecessary and potentially limiting OpenDlign’s generalization.

Depth-Specific Texts. Table 4 shows that depth-specific prompts enhance OpenDlign’s performance,
regardless of using multimodal alignment or logit aggregation. This indicates that some recognition
inaccuracies arise from processing input data as typical RGB images instead of depth maps.

Logits Aggregation. Results in Table 4 show that multi-view logit aggregation improves zero-
shot classification on all datasets by combining logits from pre-trained and fine-tuned encoders.
This approach effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem in OpenDlign’s multimodal
alignment, enabling it to recognize 3D objects identifiable by both pre-trained CLIP and OpenDlign.

ment strategies. Aligning with text modal-
ity was achieved by fine-tuning the image
encoder.

Varying Number of Views. OpenDlign, like other depth-based methods, requires extracting multiple
embeddings from multi-view depth maps for zero-shot inference. Fig. 7 shows that OpenDlign’s
zero-shot accuracy on ModelNet40 and OmniObject3D improves with more depth map views.
Notably, OpenDlign achieves top performance, comparable to TAMM-PointBERT, with just two
views, balancing latency and effective zero-shot classification.

Conclusion

In this study, we introduce OpenDlign, an open-world framework that learns robust 3D representations
from multi-view depth maps by efficiently fine-tuning with depth-aligned images, which are more
visually diverse than CAD-rendered images. The effectiveness of OpenDlign is validated on various
3D zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We also show that depth-aligned images consistently enhance
the performance of existing 3D open-world methods. Future work will explore the application of
depth-aligned images in designing open-world models for 3D scenes (See Appendix A.1).

Limitations. Due to limited computational resources, we cannot generate depth-aligned images
from the largest 3D dataset [23], containing around 1 million 3D objects. Retraining 3D open-world
models with billions of parameters using these images is also too expensive. Moreover, a data filtering
strategy is needed to remove low-quality depth-aligned images (See details in Appendix A.6).

Appendix / supplemental material

A.1
Broader Impact

The broader impact of OpenDlign, a novel 3D open-world framework, includes both potential benefits
and negative impacts associated with its deployment and use. Some considerations are unique to
OpenDlign due to its requirement to generate multi-view depth-aligned images, while others are
similar to those of existing 3D open-world methods like OpenShape [18], and TAMM [20].

Positive Impacts. While OpenDlign’s primary focus is on 3D shape understanding, it shows
significant potential for 3D scene understanding. Existing 3D open-world methods are limited by
relying on CAD-rendered images for alignment, as CAD models are typically available only for
individual objects, not entire scenes. In contrast, OpenDlign generates depth-aligned images using
depth maps instead of CAD models. These depth maps can be produced from point clouds obtained
either by sampling from CAD models or using real-scanned point clouds collected via LiDAR. Using
real-scanned point clouds allows OpenDlign to have richly textured scene images for multimodal
alignment, facilitating the learning of robust 3D scene representations.

Negative Impacts. Biases present in CLIP can be transferred to OpenDlign, potentially resulting
in biased outcomes or unfair 3D representations of diverse content. Additionally, the generated

13


---Page Break---
depth-aligned images may exhibit biased and stereotypical traits due to inherent biases in the training
data of ControlNet. OpenDlign requires generating a large number of multi-view depth-aligned
images for multimodal alignment using a diffusion model, raising concerns about energy consumption.
Furthermore, if a larger CLIP backbone is released in the future, the increasing fine-tuning costs of
OpenDlign could exacerbate these energy concerns.

In summary, OpenDlign shares common concerns with existing 3D open-world frameworks. However,
its positive impacts are unique and hold significant potential to transform the design of future 3D
open-world understanding pipelines.

A.2
Implementation Details

Training Details. OpenDlign was implemented in PyTorch, utilizing the image-text encoders
from OpenCLIP-ViT-H-14, pre-trained on the DFN5B dataset [24]. OpenDlign uses contour-aware
projections to transform point clouds into depth maps with dimensions of 224 × 224 × 3, creating
10 views along the x-axis, ranging from 30 to 330 degrees at intervals of 30 degrees between each
pair of views. The multimodal alignment was achieved by fine-tuning 10 epochs on an A100-80 GB
GPU, employing the AdamW optimizer and the OneCycle scheduler with a peak learning rate of
3 × 10−4 and a batch size of 128. Since we precache the text and image CLIP embeddings of all
shapes, training is significantly accelerated, achieving convergence in about 10 hours.

Depth-Aligned Image Generation Details. We employed the ControlNet v1.1 model [40], pre-
trained on depth maps, with settings of 20 DDIM steps, a 9.0 guidance scale, and a 1.0 control
strength for generating depth-aligned images. The prompts for generating high-quality, noise-free
depth-aligned images are detailed in Table 6. We discovered that ControlNet [40] is more sensitive
to jagged edges in the conditional depth map than Vision-Language Models. Our contour-aware
projection reduces these jagged edges using bilateral filtering in each depth channel. However, the
edges may reappear during the channel squeezing step. To combat this, we applied a 7 × 7 kernel
median filter to each projected depth map to further diminish the edges. The output images, initially
sized at 256 × 256 × 3, were then downsampled to match the depth maps’ dimensions. The entire
generation process for ShapeNet [21] spanned 16 days on 8 RTX 6000 GPUs.

Table 6: Main, positive, and negative prompts guide depth-aligned image generation. Metadata
textually describes the semantic information of the 3D data.

Main Prompt
"A realistic {metadata}."

Positive
"best quality, extremely realistic, very professional,
Prompts

Negative
"low-resolution, very blurry, unrealistic, worst quality, deep depth of field,
Prompts

A.3
Discussion

How to ensure multi-view geometry consistency in depth-aligned images? There is no geometric
inconsistency because depth-aligned images are generated view by view, each paired with its respec-
tive depth map. ControlNet’s [40] conditional control ensures the generated images maintain the
same shape and pose as the input depth map, while a text prompt preserves object identity. Since
these depth maps originate from the same 3D point cloud, the resulting images remain geometrically
consistent across views. Fig. 5 visually demonstrates the generated images are geometry-consistent.

Why does increasing texture diversity in multi-view images positively impact open-world 3D
learning? First, more effective knowledge transfer is achieved by leveraging inconsistent textures
in multi-view generated images, allowing depth maps to align with diverse sets of RGB images,
which enhances the transfer of rich 2D knowledge embedded in CLIP to 3D representation learning.
Second, generating geometry-consistent but texture-inconsistent multi-view images benefits 3D
representation learning by focusing on invariant features like object shape, size, and contour, which
remain robust to texture variations. Third, similar to previous methods [15, 17, 18], OpenDlign pairs
a single-view depth map with a single-view RGB image for contrastive learning, treating each view
independently and eliminating the need for texture consistency across views. Lastly, texture features

are generally unreliable in both 3D and 2D data, as shown by the common use of color jittering for
data augmentation in 2D contrastive learning. Increasing texture diversity is a standard approach to
improve the robustness of contrastive learning models.

More Results for Few-Shot Classification. Table 8 presents the few-shot classification results of
OpenDlign on the long-tail Objaverse-LVIS [23] dataset. OpenDlign consistently outperforms all
baselines from 1-shot to 16-shot scenarios. Surprisingly, although OpenShape demonstrates higher
zero-shot classification performance than ULIP, their few-shot results are poorer, indicating potential
overfitting during multimodal alignment.

More Results for Zero-Shot 3D Object Detection. We followed the setting in [52] to compare our
method with two 3D open-world approaches, focusing on object detection tasks OV-3DET [52] and
CoDA [53] on the Scannet [51] dataset, as shown in Table 9. The results demonstrate that OpenDlign
performs comparably to the state-of-the-art CoDA method, which is promising given that OpenDlign
is not specifically designed for open-world 3D detection.

Ablation Study on Fine-Tuning Strategies. Table 10 demonstrates that fine-tuning only attention
layers of 1 transformer block is adequate for OpenDlign to learn effective 3D representation. More-
over, placing the trainable block for fine-tuning in an independent branch (residual tuning) is crucial,
as it preserves the strong capability of pre-trained CLIP in extracting robust image representations
from depth-aligned images.

Table 10: Ablation study on various fine-tuning strategies. ‘Residual Tuning’ decides whether to tune
the transformer blocks connected residually to the CLIP encoder. ‘Trainable Copy’ initializes the
block randomly or with CLIP parameters. ‘Block Count’ is the number of trainable blocks.

Figure 6: Effect of view count on OpenDlign’s zero-shot performance on ScanObjectNN [47]

More Results for Varying Number of Views. Fig. 6 demonstrates that OpenDlign’s zero-shot
classification performance on the ScanObjectNN dataset generally improves as the number of views
increases. Notably, OpenDlign surpasses the leading baseline model, TAMM-PointBERT [20],
with approximately two views of depth maps. Table 11 presents detailed results of OpenDlign’s
performance on 16-shot classification with varying view counts across three benchmark datasets.
These results further confirm that OpenDlign’s few-shot performance, like its zero-shot performance,
consistently improves with an increasing number of views.

Additional Qualitative Analysis

Effect of Contour-Aware Projection. Fig. 7 visually compares depth maps generated using
PointCLIP V2’s projection [13] technique and our contour-aware projection method. In the PointCLIP
V2 projection, the projected maps are very blurry, losing some contour and shape details, as evidenced
by the bed frame gaps being inaccurately filled. Conversely, our contour-aware projection preserves
more of the original objects’ contours and structures, accurately showing the bed frame gaps.

Examples of Low-Quality Depth-Aligned Images. Fig. 9 showcases bad examples of depth-aligned
images. For instance, the diffusion model may interpret ‘monitor’ as a person observing something,
or it might create unrealistic images such as a washing machine made of stone. Additionally, it
might depict a tent floating in the sky, which deviates from real-world expectations. These examples
underscore the need to eliminate inferior depth-aligned images for more generalized alignment.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We clearly highlight our main contributions and the scope of this paper in
both the abstract and the concluding paragraphs of the introduction. Notably, we outline the
paper’s contributions using a bullet-point list for clarity.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have included a dedicated "Limitations" section in our paper. For detailed
information on the limitations of our work, please refer to Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See the methodology section 3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All essential components of the OpenDlign architecture are described in the
Methodology section 3. The experimental setup for downstream tasks, including zero-shot
classification, object detection, and 3D shape retrieval, is detailed in the Experiment section
4. Additionally, Appendix A.2 provides the implementation, training, and image generation
details, ensuring the reproducibility of our results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The supplementary material includes the complete code for image generation,
model training, and evaluation. All evaluation datasets and depth-aligned image datasets are
open-sourced.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The testing details for various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classifi-
cation, few-shot classification, object detection, and cross-modal retrieval, are illustrated in
Experiment section 4. The paper specifies all the training details, including hyperparameter
selection, training resources, and optimizer, in Appendix A.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported due to the computational expense. However, for the
few-shot classification analysis, our results are averaged over 10 random seeds.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

20


---Page Break---
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Appendix A.2, we specified that OpenDlign model training was conducted
using a single A100-80 GB GPU, which took 10 hours. Depth-aligned image generation
was performed using 8 RTX 6000 GPUs around 16 days.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, ensuring data integrity,
transparency, and reproducibility. Both the manuscript and supplementary material follow
the code of ethics and remain anonymous until camera-ready.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The broader impacts, both positive and negative, are discussed in Appendix
A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of diffusion models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pre-trained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not explicitly pose any risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All assets used in this paper, including code, pretraining and evaluation datasets,
and pre-trained models, are properly credited to their original creators or owners.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

22


---Page Break---
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code for this paper is well-structured with clear usage guidance. All assets
have been anonymized. The dataset and checkpoint models will be released upon the paper’s
acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
