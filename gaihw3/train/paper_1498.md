Abstract

Recent advancements in 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
promising capabilities for 3D scene understanding. However, previous methods
exhibit deficiencies in general referencing and grounding capabilities for intricate
scene comprehension. In this paper, we introduce the use of object identifiers and
object-centric representations to interact with scenes at the object level. Specif-
ically, we decompose the input 3D scene into a set of object proposals, each
assigned a unique identifier token, which enables efficient object referencing and
grounding during user-assistant interactions. Given the scarcity of scene-language
data, we model the scene embeddings as a sequence of explicit object-level em-
beddings, derived from semantic-rich 2D or 3D representations. By employing
object identifiers, we transform diverse 3D scene-language tasks into a unified
question-answering format, facilitating joint training without the need for addi-
tional task-specific heads. With minimal fine-tuning on all downstream tasks, our
model significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmarks including Scan-
Refer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D. Code has been released at

Introduction

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) [14, 39, 47, 15, 65, 32] have established
language as a universal interface for creating general-purpose assistants. This breakthrough has
been instrumental in the development of Multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), which effectively tackle
a broad spectrum of multi-modal tasks. While significant strides have been made in 2D MLLMs
[33, 35, 77, 79, 34, 31, 67], current 3D MLLMs still face significant challenges that must be overcome
to achieve a general-purpose assistant for 3D scene understanding.

Object referencing and grounding are essential for advanced scene understanding. Object referencing
involves a model’s precise comprehension of the semantics associated with a user-specified object,
while object grounding requires the model’s ability to localize a target object within the scene.
These capabilities are vital for various 3D scene-language tasks such as dense captioning [12] and
visual grounding [4, 75, 1]. However, current 3D MLLMs lack general referencing and grounding
capabilities, often failing in tasks that necessitate precise object referencing or grounding—contrary
to the objectives of addressing general-purpose tasks.

Regarding the object referencing capability, several 3D MLLMs [6, 23, 54] employ additional prompt
encoders to comprehend user-specified objects, but they still lack grounding capabilities. The 3D-

LLM [21] incorporates location tokens to enable object grounding, a technique validated in the 2D
domain [67]. However, this approach underperforms on the 3D grounding benchmark, ScanRefer [4],
compared to traditional expert models. The ineffectiveness of location tokens in the 3D domain
primarily arises from the significant data scarcity in the scene-language area. Current 3D scene-
language datasets [4, 75, 1] contain only tens of thousands of grounding instances, a scale much
smaller than the million-level datasets used for training 2D MLLMs [67, 72]. Given the exponentially
greater complexity of 3D spaces compared to 2D spaces, robust training of location tokens for 3D
MLLMs may require substantially more data than is currently used for 2D MLLMs. Therefore, our
objective is to explore more efficient methods for object referencing and grounding and to mitigate
the impact of data scarcity.

We observe that most existing 3D MLLMs convert the 3D scene into hidden 3D scene embeddings,
employing either a Q-Former-based module [21, 6] or direct projection methods [23]. Such archi-
tectures inherently lack the capability to efficiently interpret individual object instances. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for representing and interacting with 3D scenes
at the object level within the language model. This method incorporates two principal designs:
(i) referencing 3D scene using object identifiers, and (ii) representing 3D scene using well-trained
object-centric representations. The first component offers a unified format for object referencing and
grounding, while the second alleviates the requirement for extensive scene-language datasets.

Reference 3D scene using object identifiers.
Objects play a crucial role in defining and inter-
preting a scene, as their organization shapes the
entire 3D landscape. This intuition is evident
in most 3D scene understanding benchmarks,
including 3D grounding, VQA, and dense cap-
tioning, all of which annotate at the object
level. To effectively model scene embeddings
at the object level, the entire 3D scene can
be decomposed into a set of object proposals
via reliable 3D detectors [45, 27, 71, 50, 30].
Importantly, we assign objects with object
identifiers—a set of learnable identifier tokens
{<OBJk>}k=1...n—to distinguish them during
language modeling. This design allows the LLM to reference respective objects using discrete
identifier tokens. As the example shown in Figure 1, the chair and the two trash cans are labeled as
“<OBJ013>”, “<OBJ023>”, and “<OBJ032>”, respectively. This avoids the text ambiguity that arises
from subjective viewing words like “rightmost”. Besides, the lengthy description like “the chair
located at the southwest corner of the rightmost table” often complicates user-assistant interaction.
These identifiers enable efficient object referencing and grounding during user-assistant interactions.
By using these identifiers, we convert diverse 3D scene-language tasks into a unified format of
question-answering pairs, facilitating joint training without any additional task-specific heads.

Represent 3D scene using well-trained object-centric representations. The scene-level repre-
sentation requires a large amount of paired scene-language data for training, which is generally
unaffordable and labor-intensive due to its complex real-world scenarios. To address this challenge,
our model represents the scenes using a set of object-level embeddings, which obtain object-centric
representations from well-trained 2D and 3D models. Specifically, after obtaining object propos-
als from prior detectors (either 2D or 3D), we extract the object features using well-trained 3D
object-centric representations [78] or 2D representations [40]. Due to the million-level pre-training,
these representations contain abundant semantic and visual cues. Through simple linear layers, we
project them into the embedding space of the language model. Combined with the object identifier,
the sequences of object-level embeddings are thus constructed into scene embeddings and fed into
the LLM. With merely two epochs of fine-tuning on all downstream tasks, extensive experiments
on either 3D, 3D+2D, or 2D-only settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in various
downstream 3D scene understanding tasks.

We perform comprehensive experiments across five representative 3D scene-language datasets,
including ScanRefer [4], Multi3DRefer [75], Scan2Cap [12], ScanQA [2], and SQA3D [38]. Our
model consistantly enhances state-of-the-art performance across all these datasets without fine-tuning

on specific tasks. Notably, it surpasses previous methods by 3.7% (Acc@0.5) on ScanRefer, 14.0%
(F1@0.5) on Multi3DRefer, 8.7% (CIDEr@0.5) on Scan2Cap, and 7.7% (CIDEr) on ScanQA.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose an enhanced 3D MLLM which models and interacts with 3D scenes at the object level.
• We introduce object identifiers to enable efficient referencing and grounding within 3D scenes. By
leveraging these identifiers, we convert diverse 3D scene-language tasks into a unified question-
answering format, facilitating joint training without necessitating additional task-specific heads.
• We effectively represent the 3D scene through a sequence of multi-modal object-centric representa-
tions derived from well-trained foundation models, which alleviate the impact of scene-language
data scarcity.
• Our model significantly enhances state-of-the-art performance across various 3D scene-language
datasets without fine-tuning for specific tasks. Extensive experiments on either 3D, 3D+2D, or
2D-only settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for 3D indoor scene understanding.

3D Scene-language Understanding In the rapidly evolving field of 3D scene understanding, there is
an increasing focus on using language to provide both contextual knowledge and query conditions,
thus enabling precise interpretation of user intentions. This process, known as “3D scene-language
understanding”, leverages language to more effectively grasp the intricacies of 3D environments
in a manner consistent with human cognition. The primary tasks in this domain include: 1) 3D
Visual Grounding [4, 1, 25, 75, 7, 52, 76, 53, 48], which involves locating specified objects within
a 3D scene based on textual queries; 2) 3D Dense Captioning [12, 69, 28, 8, 9], which demands
proficiency in both localizing and captioning objects densely in the scene; 3) 3D Visual Question
Answering [2, 43, 38], which focuses on general scene question answering. Initial efforts concentrated
on specialized tasks, resulting in limited generalizability across different 3D scene understanding
tasks. Recent initiatives such as 3DJCG [3] and D3Net [?] have aimed to unify tasks like 3D visual
grounding and dense captioning, leveraging their synergistic benefits to enhance overall model
performance. Advances like 3D-VisTA [80] and 3D-VLP [29] are working to develop a more general
3D visual-language framework through pre-training techniques for better scene-language alignment.
However, despite these models’ adeptness at handling various 3D scene tasks, their reliance on
task-specific heads limits their adaptability for broader user-assistant interactions.

Multi-modal Large Language Models. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited impressive capabilities in intricate reasoning and interactive dialogues with humans [14,
39, 47, 15]. There is a growing interest in enhancing the scope of LLMs to encompass additional
modalities [31, 33, 35, 77, 79, 20, 19, 21, 54, 65, 32, 61, 23, 10]. In the 3D realm, PointLLM [61]
directly maps point clouds into the embedding space of the LLM. Both Imagebind-LLM [20] and
Point-LLM [19] integrate the 3D modality into LLMs by establishing a joint embedding space
among 3D point clouds, images, audio, and text. These models perform well at the object level but
encounter difficulties when interpreting complex spatial relationships in 3D scenes. To improve
scene understanding, 3D-LLM [21] incorporates positional embedding and learns location tokens.
Nevertheless, it projects 3D features into the input space of pre-trained 2D Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Involving 2D encoders make it difficult to grasp the 3D spatial structure and intricate
relationships among objects. Chat-3D [54] tackles this limitation by directly utilizing 3D scene-text
data to align the 3D scene with the LLM, overcoming the challenge of limited data availability
through a pre-alignment phase. However, the architectural design of this model limits its focus on
specific target objects during interactions. Current 3D MLLMs face challenges in precise object
referencing and grounding, limiting their functionality to straightforward tasks. By incorporating
object identifiers into the LLM, we significantly enhance the object referencing and grounding
capabilities of 3D MLLMs, thereby showing potential for complex real-world applications.

3D Representation Learning
Recently, numerous efforts have been made to learn discriminative
and robust representations for 3D point clouds, which serve as a fundamental visual modality.
Approaches such as PointBERT [68], Point-MAE [41], Transformer-OcCo [51], and Point-m2ae [73]
employ self-supervised learning techniques to extract meaningful representations of 3D objects from
unlabeled point cloud data. Another set of works [62, 36, 74, 17, 58, 56, 55, 57] seeks to extend

construct 3D-image-text triplets to align point clouds within the CLIP [44] representation space. C-
MCR [58] and Ex-MCR [56] learn contrastive representations between various modalities, including
3D point clouds. They leverage knowledge from existing MCR spaces to tackle to challenge of
lacking paired data. These robust 3D representations effectively capture detailed information about
3D objects. Our approach involves segmenting the 3D scene at the instance level and extracting a set
of object features to represent the entire scene.

Method

3.1
Overview

Our motivation is to facilitate object referencing and grounding for 3D MLLMs while simultaneously
addressing the scarcity of scene-language data. We propose representing 3D scenes at the object level
by using object identifiers for referencing and employing well-trained, object-centric representations
for scene depiction. Section 3.2 delineates the model architecture, which primarily consists of
generating a sequence of object-level embeddings to represent the entire scene. Section 3.3 provides
illustrations of the prompt template through examples. Lastly, Section 3.4 details the training
methodology of our model.

3.2
Model Architecture

As illustrated in Figure 2, our method processes a 3D scene’s point cloud by decomposing it into
object proposals using a pre-trained detector. We then employ pre-trained 3D and 2D encoders to
derive object-centric representations from point clouds and multi-view images, respectively. These
representations are subsequently mapped into the token embedding space of a language model. By
incorporating n object identifiers into the language model’s vocabulary, we link these identifiers to the
corresponding object proposals, thereby facilitating efficient object referencing and grounding during
user-assistant interactions. Finally, the scene embeddings, composed of a sequence of object-level
embeddings, are input into the LLM.

---Page Break---
Object Detector. Given a point cloud from a 3D scene, we decompose it into n objects using
the pre-trained detector Mask3D [45]. Compared to object detection models [11, 46], the instance
segmentation model is preferred in this work due to due to its capability to generate accurate masks,
which are essential for subsequent projection into 2D masks on multi-view images. The point cloud
of the i-th object is denoted as Pi ∈Rmi×6, where mi represents the number of points in the i-th
object, and the 6D information for each point comprises its 3D coordinates and RGB colors.

Object Identifiers. To achieve a localized understanding of 3D scenes, we introduce a set of learnable
identifier tokens {<OBJi>}i=1...n, designated as object identifiers, into the token vocabulary of the
language model. These identifiers are processed by the tokenizer to produce their respective token
embeddings {Oi}i=1...n. The identifier tokens are then integrated with the object tokens to establish
one-to-one correspondences, thereby enabling object referencing and grounding using identifiers in
subsequent interactions.

Object-level Embeddings. After extracting object proposals from the 3D scene, we derive object
features using well-trained 3D and 2D object representations. Owing to the million-level scale of
pre-training, these representations are rich in semantic and visual cues. By employing simple linear
layers, we project them into the embedding space of the language model. Together with identifier
token embeddings, this process yields object-level embeddings for each object.

3D Encoder. The 3D encoder excels in extracting spatial and shape attributes from point clouds.
We employ a pre-trained 3D encoder Uni3D [78] to derive object-centric 3D representations. This
embedding processes each object’s point cloud Pi, outputting the feature Zp
i for each object.

2D Encoder. The 2D encoder adeptly extracts semantically rich features from 2D images. We project
the point clouds for each object onto multi-view images, creating a sequence of 2D masks. Utilizing a
pre-trained DINOv2 [40], we extract and aggregate local features from all masked regions across the
multi-view images of each object, taking into account both mask areas and multi-view information.
We opted for DINOv2 over the more common CLIP [43] due to its superior handling of local features
within images. The 2D encoder processes the multi-view images and their corresponding projected
masks from each object’s point cloud Pi, generating the visual feature Zv
i for each object. Details
are provided in Appendix A.

Visual-Language Projectors. To align the extracted object representations with the language model,
we employ a 3D-language projector fp(·) and a 2D-language projector fv(·) to map the 3D point
cloud features and 2D visual features into the token embedding space of the language model. For the
i-th object, these features are represented as token embeddings Fp
i and Fv
i .

Fp
i = fp(Zp
i );
Fv
i = fv(Zv
i ).
(1)

Scene Embeddings. Following the process described above, we obtain an object identifier token
embedding Oi, a 3D object token embedding Fp
i , and a 2D object token embedding Fv
i for each
object. We combine the identifier token embeddings and object token embeddings in an one-to-one
correspondence manner to formulate a sequence of object-level embeddings, which represents the
constructed scene embeddings and then be fed into the LLM to represent the whole scene.

3.3
Prompt Template

Despite variations in task formulations, both referencing and grounding are unified using object
identifiers. As illustrated in Table 1, the system message encodes object information in the scene as a
sequence of “<OBJi> <object>”, where <OBJi> denotes the identifier token for the i-th proposal,
and <object> serves as the placeholder for object tokens. The language tokenizer converts <OBJi>
into its token embedding Oi and <object> into the combined object token features Fp
i and Fv
i . As
illustrated by the following interaction, the user can directly employ identifier tokens to reference
specific objects, while the assistant uses these tokens in responses to precisely ground target objects.

3.4
Training Strategy

Most existing MLLMs [18, 35, 23] adopt a two-stage training approach, comprising an initial
alignment phase to train the projector exclusively, followed by a fine-tuning phase for both the
projector and the language model. This method not only demands extra data and extended training
duration for alignment but also complicates determining the optimal duration for the initial phase.
Consequently, we opt for a single-stage process, concurrently training both the projectors and the

language model. In our experiments, we observe that this jointly trained model already exhibits
superior performance without the necessity of fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks.

Training Data We aggregate essential training data for downstream tasks and standardize it into
uniform instruction formats. The downstream tasks encompass 3D visual grounding (ScanRefer
& Multi3DRef), 3D dense captioning (Scan2Cap), and 3D visual question answering (ScanQA &
SQA3D). We incorporate the training sets from these datasets into our training corpus. Each task is
adaptable to a single-turn user-assistant interaction, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Training Objective We have unified all tasks into a consistent user-assistant interaction format,
and as a result, the sole training loss in the joint-training phase is the Cross-Entropy loss of the
language model. The training objective is to optimize the trainable parameters, denoted by θ, aiming
to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the target response sequence sres generated by the assistant.
Specifically, given the input prefix sequence sprefix, which encompasses both system messages and
user instructions, the loss function is expressed as follows:

L(θ) = −

k
X

i=1
log P(sres
i |sres
[1,...,i−1], sprefix),
(2)

where k is the number of tokens in the response sequence, and sres
[1,...,i−1] denotes the sequence of the
previous i −1 tokens in the response. The set of trainable parameters θ includes two vision-language
projectors, newly added n token embeddings for object identifiers, and the language model itself.

Datasets and Metrics

Datasets. We conducted experiments on five benchmarks: ScanRefer [4] for single-object visual
grounding, Multi3DRefer [75] for multi-object visual grounding, Scan2Cap [12] for dense captioning,
and both ScanQA [2] and SQA3D [38] for visual question answering. These benchmarks are based
on the ScanNet dataset [16], which comprises richly annotated RGB-D scans of real-world indoor
scenes, including both 2D and 3D data across 1,513 scans. All benchmarks adhere to the same
train/validation/test splits, facilitating joint training and evaluation.

Metrics. We adhere to the commonly used metrics in these benchmarks. For ScanRefer [4], we assess
thresholded accuracy with Acc@0.25 and Acc@0.5, where predictions are deemed positive if they
exhibit higher Intersection over Union (IoU) with the ground truths than the thresholds of 0.25 and
0.5, respectively. In evaluating grounding for a flexible number of target objects in Multi3DRefer [75],
we employ the F1 score at IoU thresholds of 0.25 and 0.5. For Scan2Cap [12], we utilize CIDEr@0.5
and BLEU-4@0.5 (abbreviated as C@0.5 and B-4@0.5), integrating image captioning metrics with
the IoU scores between predicted and target bounding boxes. For ScanQA [2], the metrics CIDEr [49]
and BLEU-4 [42], abbreviated as C and B-4, are used. SQA3D [38] is evaluated using exact match
accuracy (EM) and its refined version, EM-R, as proposed by LEO [23].

4.2
Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods

Compared Baselines. The baseline models can be classified into two principal categories: traditional
expert models and general multi-modal LLMs. Traditional expert models generate outputs in a fixed
format tailored to specific tasks. Conversely, LLM-based models yield open-ended outputs suitable
for a broader range of applications.

• Expert Models: Models such as ScanRefer [4] and ScanQA [2] establish initial benchmarks for
the ScanRefer and ScanQA datasets, respectively. 3DJCG [3] integrates multiple tasks within a
single architecture, unifying visual grounding and dense captioning tasks due to their synergistic
nature. Both 3D-VLP [29] and 3D-VisTA [80] aim to develop versatile 3D visual-language
frameworks by focusing on pre-training strategies for 3D scene-language alignment. M3DRef-
CLIP [75] introduces multi-object grounding, enhancing single-object grounding performance.
ConcreteNet [48], the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model on the ScanRefer benchmark, innovates three
methods to augment verbo-visual fusion for dense 3D visual grounding. Vote2Cap-DETR++ [9]
decouples the processes of caption generation and object localization through parallel decoding,
making it the SOTA model on the Scan2Cap benchmark.
• LLM-based Models: LAMM [66] extends research on 2D MLLM to point clouds but lacks a
design tailored for 3D scene tasks. Chat-3D [54] introduces an object-centric method yet fails to
address general 3D scene tasks comprehensively. 3D-LLM [21] utilizes location tokens for object
grounding but is constrained by data scarcity. LL3DA [6] develops an assistant that processes

point cloud data directly, responding to textual instructions and visual prompts. LEO [23] pioneers
an embodied generalist approach by incorporating action tokens. Scene-LLM [18] merges scene-
level and egocentric 3D information, enhancing understanding and reasoning in 3D environments.
However, LL3DA, LEO, and Scene-LLM lack grounding capabilities.

Analysis. As shown in Table 2, our model surpasses previous methods across almost all metrics
without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a promising unified framework for 3D scene under-
standing. For visual grounding tasks, our model boosts the state-of-the-art performance by 3.7%
(Acc@0.5) on ScanRefer and 14.0% (F1@0.5) on Multi3DRefer, demonstrating excellent grounding
capabilities. For the dense captioning task, we improve the SOTA performance by 8.7% (CIDEr@0.5)
on Scan2Cap, highlighting strong object referring and captioning ability. For VQA tasks on ScanQA
and SQA3D, which do not require object referencing and grounding, we still achieve consistent
performance enhancement, demonstrating improved overall 3D scene understanding and reasoning.

Ablation Study

Object Identifiers. Table 3 shows that the format of object identifiers affects both performance and
token cost. For comparing token costs, we consider scenes with hundreds of objects. A straightforward
approach is to use plain text for object identifiers such as “Obj001”, which is tokenized into four
tokens (“Obj”, “0”, “0”, “1”). Including two object tokens (3D & 2D), representing a single object
requires six tokens in total. This high token cost makes the approach impractical for real-world
scenarios. Thus, we explored using a single token per identifier by adding new tokens to the language’s
vocabulary. We assess two strategies: employing fixed random Gaussian embeddings ("Gaussian")
and using learnable tokens ("Learnable"). The results show that learnable tokens enhance performance
and reduce token costs simultaneously. Lowering token costs from 6N to 3N significantly reduces
memory usage and accelerates training/inference when handling 3D scenes with numerous objects.

Multi-modal Object-centric Representations. We evaluate various methods for retrieving object
features and combining features from different sources (3D and 2D), as shown in Table 4. As
described in Section 3.2, the 3D and 2D features are derived from the 3D encoder and 2D encoder,
respectively. We assess two methods of extracting 2D features: one from a single-view image
(“Single”) and another from multi-view images (“Multi”).

First, we evaluate the performance of using either a single 3D feature or a single 2D feature for
the object token. The results show that using a 2D feature derived from multi-view images yields

better performance than using a 3D feature. This suggests that semantic information from 2D visual
contexts is more crucial than spatial information from 3D point clouds. It may also indicate that the
pre-trained 2D encoder is more reliable than the pre-trained 3D encoder due to the abundance of 2D
image-text data compared to 3D-text data for pre-training.

Next, we assess the combination of both 3D and 2D features using two fusion methods. The first
method, named “Separate Token” in the table, involves using two separate object tokens (3D and 2D
object tokens) to represent object information. The second method, termed “Early Fusion”, combines
the 3D and 2D features into a single token for each object. The results indicate that combining
3D and 2D features consistently improves performance compared to using a single 3D/2D feature,
highlighting the importance of utilizing both modalities. Fusing 3D and 2D tokens reduces the token
cost, while it results in a slight performance drop. This provides an option for situations where the
token limit is tight, suggesting that combining multi-modal features into one token is acceptable.

Experiments with 2D Video Input

In practical applications of 3D scene understanding, acquiring indoor RGB (video) scan is simpler
than obtaining a processed 3D point cloud from RGB-D images. We examine our model’s ability to
adapt to video input (without depth) for 3D indoor scenes based on the ScanNet [16] dataset. For
video input, we use a tracking-based video detector DEVA [13] to extract object proposals. This
process involves detecting objects in each frame and merging these proposals across frames via the
tracking module. After extracting objects from the video, we perform the same operations as for the
3D tasks. The grounding results can then be evaluated on video frames with 2D masks.

Tasks and Metrics. We assess video ground-
ing and VQA tasks for video input. For video
grounding, we use descriptions annotated in
ScanRefer and project the ground-truth object’s
point cloud to 2D masks in video frames, allow-
ing us to compute the IoU between the predicted
masks and GT masks in 2D images. Given
a video with a frame length of L, the predicted masks are a series of 2D masks denoted as
{Mp
i ∈RH×W }i=1...L and the GT masks denoted as {Mg
i ∈RH×W }i=1...L, where H and W are
the height and width of an image, respectively. We concatenate these masks along the temporal
axis to obtain a predicted spatial-temporal mask ˜
Mp ∈RH×W ×L and a GT spatial-temporal mask
˜
Mg ∈RH×W ×L. We propose calculating the Spatial-Temporal IoU (ST-IoU) between the predicted
mask ˜
Mp and the GT mask ˜
Mg. Thus, similar to the metrics for the grounding task on ScanRefer,
we use Acc@0.25 and Acc@0.5 to measure accuracy based on the ST-IoU threshold. For VQA tasks,
we use the annotations of ScanQA and SQA3D along with their respective metrics for evaluation.

Performance Analysis. Table 5 presents the evaluation results of video grounding and VQA tasks.
For video grounding, we compute upper bound results to assess the quality of object masks extracted
by the video detector. Compared to the upper bound and random results, our method demonstrates
strong grounding ability. Visualization results are provided in Figure 4. The second example shows
that the tracking-based video detector might lose track of an object after it has been out of sight
for a prolonged period. This is a primary reason for the low quality of the extracted object masks.
Missing parts of the frames that contain the target object leads to the low Acc@0.5 result of the
upper bound. For VQA tasks, we achieve comparable results to those using objects extracted from
3D inputs. This indicates that despite the lower quality of extracted objects from video input, our
approach of constructing scene embeddings from sequences of object-level embeddings efficiently
enhances overall scene comprehension, thereby improving QA performance on ScanQA and SQA3D.

Conclusion

To enable efficient object referencing and grounding abilities in 3D MLLMs, this paper proposes
modeling and interacting with 3D scenes at the object level. It decomposes the input 3D scene
into a set of object proposals assigned with object identifiers. Given the scarcity of scene-language
data, we model the scene embeddings as a sequence of explicit object-level embeddings, derived
from semantic-rich 2D and 3D representations. By using object identifiers, we transform diverse
3D scene-language tasks into a unified question-answering format. With minimal fine-tuning on all
downstream tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks.

Implementation Details

For the 3D point cloud input, we utilize the 3D instance segmentation model Mask3D [45] to extract
100 object proposals. We then employ the pre-trained encoder Uni3D [78] to obtain 3D features and
DINOv2 [40] for 2D features. Both the 3D-language projector fp(·) and the 2D-language projector
fv(·) are three-layer MLPs. For the video input, we use the open-vocabulary video segmentation
model DEVA [13] to extract object proposals, with an average object number of 48. We choose the
Vicuna-7B-v1.5 model [14] as the language model, which is based on LLaMA 2 [47]. We fine-tune
the language model using LoRA [22], with the rank set to 16. The base learning rate is set to 5e-6
with a cosine annealing schedule, and the batch size is 32. The training takes 2 epochs and the total
training step is 3200. The entire training process takes approximately 8 hours on 4 NVIDIA A100
GPUs.

2D Encoder. We describe the method for deriving 2D representations from the projected input
masks and multi-view images. The 2D model DINOv2 [40] computes a 257×1024 feature vector for
each image, comprising a 1×1024 CLS feature and 256×1024 patch features. These patch features
represent local areas in the images divided into 16×16 patches. For each object mask within an
image, we extract patch features only where the patch intersects with the mask. We then average
these extracted patch features along the patch axis to obtain a 1×1024 feature vector per image. For
patch features sourced from multi-view images, we average them weighted by the mask size on each
image. We apply this procedure to extract DINOv2 features from multi-view images for each object,
thus generating the final object representations. In our ablation study, described in Section 4.3, we
introduce a “Single” approach where we select the image with the largest mask for the current object
and extract features solely from this image.

B
Quantitative Results

For the five datasets, we employ evaluation metrics as proposed in their respective original publica-
tions. We compare our model against a comprehensive array of state-of-the-art methods, as detailed
in Table 6 for ScanRefer [4], Table 7 for Multi3DRefer [75], Table 8 for Scan2Cap [12], Table 9 for
ScanQA [2], and Table 10 for SQA3D [38].

C.1
3D Question Answering

We present four evaluation results for 3D question answering on ScanQA [2] dataset, as shown in
Figure 5. In this dataset, both the input and the output do not contain object referencing. This dataset
does not include object referencing in either the input or output. Example (a) necessitates the model’s
ability to perceive an object’s appearance, specifically its color. Example (b) demands that the model
identify a target object based on a descriptive prompt. Example (c) involves the model describing
the position of a target object, while example (d) tests the model’s capability to count objects. Our
model demonstrates relatively high performance on the first three types of tasks but often struggles
with the fourth, particularly when the count of target objects is large. Accurately perceiving and
localizing each object is essential for the counting task; failure to do so results in incorrect answers.
This challenge persists in both our method and previous methods. Moreover, the inferior annotation
quality within the ScanQA dataset exacerbates this issue. For instance, the question in example (d),
“How many black chairs are on the right?” lacks a precise definition of “right”, leading to potential
confusion for the model.

C.2
3D Visual Grounding

We present six evaluation results for 3D visual grounding on ScanRefer [4] dataset, as illustrated in
Figure 6. This task challenges the model to localize a target object based on a descriptive prompt. For
simpler scenarios, such as those in examples (a) and (b), our model performs adequately. However, it
struggles with the remaining four examples for various reasons.

In example (c), the model is tasked with identifying a chair “against the wall” but erroneously
selects a chair that is not positioned as described. This highlights a deficiency in our model’s
understanding of interior structural elements like walls, ceilings, and floors. Despite the presence
of segmented annotations for these surfaces, they are typically not utilized in training because they
are not considered objects per se. This limitation is likely shared by many current methods. Future
work is necessary to enhance the model’s recognition of these elements, given their significance in
comprehending the entirety of a 3D scene. In example (d), the challenge involves identifying two
pillows “placed on the armchair’, one black and the other white. The model correctly locates a pillow
on the armchair but fails to distinguish it by color. Example (e) presents a scenario where the model
confuses a window for a door, likely due to their similar appearances and the often incomplete nature
of the input point cloud. In example (f), the model’s selection meets the description, illustrating a
flaw in the ScanRefer dataset annotations: some descriptions may correspond to multiple objects,
rendering them ineffective for evaluating the visual grounding of a single object.

Input/Output Format Comparison

We present comparative examples of input/output formats in Figure 11. We juxtapose our model
against leading expert models (3D-VisTA [80], 3D-VLP [29], 3DJCG [3], M3DRef [75], and
MVT [25]) as well as 3D MLLMs (3D-LLM [21], Chat-3D [54], LLM-Grounder [63], LL3DA [6],
and LEO [23]). We enumerate several common tasks for varied combinations of input and output
formats and provide examples of interactions using object identifiers with our model. It is necessary
to acknowledge that some responses shown here are not directly produced by our model due to a lack
of adequate data for fine-tuning on these tasks, such as multi-object summaries, multiple-choice QA,
and complex planning. The comparison underscores the potential for employing object identifiers to
address complex tasks involving single or multiple object references in the input/output, representing
a significant enhancement over previous methods restricted to simple tasks with basic formats.

E
Limitation and Societal Impact

Limitation. The primary limitation of our method stems from its reliance on pre-trained foundation
models, including 2D/3D detectors and 2D/3D encoders. In our experiments, we froze these models
under the presumption of their robust performance. Yet, they occasionally produce incorrect results,
as evidenced by the failure cases detailed in the supplementary material. To establish an end-to-end
pipeline and enhance model performance further, future work will involve integrating these foundation
models into the entire training process.

Another significant challenge is the scarcity of data. While the development of 2D vision-language
models has benefited from the availability of millions of image-text pairs for pre-training, the 3D-
language domain grapples with a dearth of corresponding data, adversely affecting the alignment
between 3D and language spaces. This issue is particularly acute in 3D scene understanding, where
the limited availability of scene-language pairs restricts training by failing to provide adequate spatial
relationship data. Despite our model’s impressive performance in various evaluations, it occasionally
misclassifies objects, notably in underrepresented classes such as "hair dryer" and "soap dish."
Future initiatives should aim to enhance data volume to bolster the 3D MLLM’s scene understanding
capabilities.

Societal Impact. Our model has achieved consistent performance improvements in multiple tasks
related to 3D indoor scene understanding, which is beneficial and potentially applicable to downstream

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our contribution of building a 3D MLLM with object identifiers is clearly
claimed in both abstract and introduction (Section 1).
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitations are discussed in Appendix E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

21


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper focuses on practical aspects of training neural networks, and no new
theoretical results are included.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The implementation details in given in Appendix A. The model design, training
data, input/output format is illustrated in Section 3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

22


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the code in the supplementary material with a README which
includes instructions for preparing data, training, and evaluating. Also, we will release the
code to public after careful organization.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in Appendix A. The training and test
details are included in the code and instructions in the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We keep the same basic training settings (learning rate, batch size, training
steps, random seed) across all the experiments reported in Section 4 to produce a meaningful
ablation study. However, we do not report error bars due to the limited time and resources
available for training the LLM multiple times.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

23


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the required hardware resources (GPU type, GPU number, and
execution time) in Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We’ve reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and we make sure the research
conforms with the Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the societal impact in Appendix E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

24


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The model in our paper is based on an open-source large language model,
and our fine-tuning procedure does not introduce additional risks. Users are encouraged to
adhere to the safeguards provided by the open-source LLM.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creators of the used datasets and models in our paper are properly cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

25


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code/model provided in the supplementary material is documented with
detailed instructions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

26


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
