Abstract

Reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently rife with non-stationarity since the states
and rewards the agent observes during training depend on its changing policy.
Therefore, networks in deep RL must be capable of adapting to new observations
and fitting new targets. However, previous works have observed that networks
trained under non-stationarity exhibit an inability to continue learning, termed
loss of plasticity, and eventually a collapse in performance. For off-policy deep
value-based RL methods, this phenomenon has been correlated with a decrease
in representation rank and the ability to fit random targets, termed capacity loss.
Although this correlation has generally been attributed to neural network learn-
ing under non-stationarity, the connection to representation dynamics has not
been carefully studied in on-policy policy optimization methods. In this work,
we empirically study representation dynamics in Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) on the Atari and MuJoCo environments, revealing that PPO agents are
also affected by feature rank deterioration and capacity loss. We show that this
is aggravated by stronger non-stationarity, ultimately driving the actor’s perfor-
mance to collapse, regardless of the performance of the critic. We ask why the
trust region, specific to methods like PPO, cannot alleviate or prevent the col-
lapse and find a connection between representation collapse and the degradation
of the trust region, one exacerbating the other. Finally, we present Proximal
Feature Optimization (PFO), a novel auxiliary loss that, along with other in-
terventions, shows that regularizing the representation dynamics mitigates the
performance collapse of PPO agents. Code and run histories are available at

Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are inherently subject to non-stationarity as the states and rewards
they observe change during learning. Therefore, neural networks in deep RL must be capable of
adapting to new inputs and fitting new targets. However, previous works have observed that networks
trained under non-stationarity exhibit an inability to continue learning, termed loss of plasticity,
and a collapse in performance (Dohare et al., 2021; Abbas et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023; Dohare
et al., 2023a,b). Kumar et al. (2021); Lyle et al. (2022) connect this phenomenon to representation
dynamics and show that value networks in off-policy value-based RL algorithms exhibit a decrease
in the rank of their representations, termed feature rank collapse, and a decrease in their ability
to regress to arbitrary targets, called capacity loss. Although this deterioration in representation
is more generally attributed to neural networks trained under non-stationarity (Lyle et al., 2023),
the connection to representation dynamics has been overlooked in on-policy policy optimization
methods. In particular, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), one of the
most popular policy optimization methods, makes several minibatch updates over non-stationary data,
unlike vanilla policy gradient methods, and optimizes a surrogate loss that depends on a moving old

policy. This raises the question of how much PPO agents are impacted by the same representation
degradation attributed to non-stationarity. Dohare et al. (2021, 2023a,b) have shown that PPO agents
lose plasticity throughout training but have only diagnosed it as a collapse in performance or as an
Adam optimization issue. Igl et al. (2021) have shown that non-stationarity affects the generalization
of PPO agents (learning speed when training episodes are very different otherwise performance at
test time on novel episodes) but not necessarily training, and no connection was made with the feature
rank and capacity measures used in the recent value-based works. One crucial outstanding question
is why the trust region embedded in methods like PPO is unable to prevent the deterioration in policy
by constraining its update. To address these gaps, we present the following contributions:

1. We provide the first study of feature rank and capacity loss in on-policy policy optimization,
revealing that PPO agents in the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013) and
MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) environments are subject to representation collapse.
2. We draw connections between representation collapse, performance collapse, and trust region
issues in PPO, showing that PPO’s clipping becomes ineffective under poor representations
and fails to prevent performance collapse, which is irrecoverable due to loss of capacity. We
further isolate the breakdown of the trust region in a theoretical setting.
3. We corroborate these connections by performing interventions that regularize non-
stationarity and representations and result in a better trust region and mitigation of per-
formance collapse, incidentally giving insights on sharing an actor-critic trunk.
4. We propose Proximal Feature Optimization (PFO), a new regularization on the representation
of the policy that regularizes the change in pre-activations. PFO strengthens our analysis by
addressing the representation issues and mitigating performance collapse.
5. We open source our code providing a comprehensive and reproducible codebase for studying
representation dynamics in policy optimization and a large database of run histories with
extensive logging for further investigation on this topic.

Background

Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto, 2018) We formalize our RL setting with the finite-
horizon undiscounted Markov decision process, describing the interaction between an agent and an
environment with finite 2 sets of states S and actions A, and a reward function r : S×A×S →R. An
initial state S0 ∈S is sampled from the environment, then at each time step t ∈{0, . . . , tmax−1}, the
agent observes the state St ∈S, picks an action At ∈A according to its policy π : S →∆(A) with
probability π(At|St), 3 observes the next state St+1 ∈S sampled from the environment and receives
a reward Rt+1 .= r(St, At, St+1). We denote by Gt .= Ptmax−1
k=t
Rk+1 the return after the action at

time step t. The goal of the agent is to maximize its expected return J(π) .= Eπ

Eπ[G0] over the induced random trajectories. We discuss the choice of this setting in Appendix A.1.

Actor-Critic Agent We consider on-policy deep actor-critic agents which train a policy (or actor)
network π(·; θ) also denoted πθ, and a value (or critic) network ˆv(·; w) that approximates the return
of πθ at every state. At every training stage, the agent collects a batch of samples, called rollout, with
its current policy πθ, and both networks are trained with gradient descent on this data. The critic is
trained to minimize the Euclidean distance to an estimator of the returns (e.g., Gt). We use λ-returns
computed with the Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2015b). The actor is
trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017).

Proximal Policy Optimization PPO-Clip, the most popular variant of PPO algorithms (Schulman
et al., 2017), optimizes the actor by repeatedly maximizing the objective in Equation 1 at each rollout.

2The pixel-based environment with discrete actions used in our experiments and our simple theoretical
example in Section 3.2.1 fit the finite state and action formalism but not our continuous action space environment.
We refer the reader to Szepesvári (2022) for a formalism of RL in that setting.
3The time step t is included in the representation of St to preserve the Markov property in finite-horizon
tasks as done by Pardo et al. (2018) and is analogous to considering time-dependent policies in the classical
formulation of finite-horizon MDPs.

The objective is defined for some small hyperparameter ϵ; πold is the last πθ of the previous optimiza-
tion phase, used to collect a training batch (rollout) after each optimization phase; Ψt is an estimator
of the advantage of πold (e.g., Ψt = Gt −ˆv(St; wold)); we use the GAE in our experiments. An
optimization phase consists of maximizing the objective with minibatch gradient steps over multiple
epochs on the training batch. We refer to PPO-Clip as PPO and provide a pseudocode in Algorithm 1.

Intuitively, PPO aims to maximize the policy advantage Eπold

defined by
Kakade & Langford (2002), which participates in a lower bound to the improvement of πθ given
that it is close to πold (Schulman et al., 2015a, see Theorem 1). In this regard, a gradient step on

πold
(θ) would increase (resp. decrease) the probability of actions at states yielding positive (resp.
negative) advantage until the ratio between the policies for those actions reaches 1 + ϵ (resp. 1 −ϵ)
at which point the gradient at those samples becomes null. This is a heuristic to ensure a trust region
that keeps policies close to each other, resulting in policy improvement.

Non-stationarity in deep RL and PPO The actor and the critic networks are both subject to non-
stationarity in deep RL. As the agent improves, it visits different states, shifting the distribution of
states which makes the networks’ input distribution non-stationary. This also holds for the targets to
fit the critic, which change as the returns of the policy change. Unlike vanilla policy gradient (Sutton
et al., 1999), and A2C (Mnih et al., 2016), PPO’s objective is optimized by performing multiple
epochs of minibatch gradient descent on the current collected batch, potentially making the networks
more likely to be impacted by previous training rollouts. In this sense, increasing the number of
epochs in PPO can cause the agent to “overfit” more to previous experience.

Feature rank As done in most works studying feature dynamics in deep RL (Lyle et al., 2022;
Kumar et al., 2021), we refer to the activations of the last hidden layer of a network (the penultimate
layer) as the features or representation learned by the network. On a batch of N samples, this
gives a matrix of dimensions N × D denoted by Φ, where D < N is the width of the penultimate
layer. Several measures of the rank of this matrix have been used to quantify the “quality” of the
representation (Kumar et al., 2021; Gulcehre et al., 2022; Lyle et al., 2022; Andriushchenko et al.,
2023). Their absolute values differ significantly, but their dynamics are often correlated. We track
all of the different rank metrics in our experiments, compare them in Appendix E, and use the
approximate rank in our main figures for its connection to principal component analysis (PCA).
Given a threshold δ ∈R and the singular values ⟨σi(Φ), . . . , σD(Φ)⟩of Φ in decreasing order, the

approximate rank of Φ is mink

which corresponds to the smallest dimension

of the subspace recovering (1 −δ)% of the variance of Φ. We use δ = 0.01 i.e. the reconstruction
recovers 99% of the variance as done by Andriushchenko et al. (2023); Yang et al. (2020). We refer to
this metric as feature rank with reference to the rank of the feature matrix when there is no ambiguity.

Capacity loss Target-fitting capacity (Lyle et al., 2022) is computed on checkpoints of a network
undergoing some training to measure the evolution of its ability to fit some chosen target independent
from its training. It is a concrete metric to evaluate plasticity. Given a fixed target (distribution over
inputs and outputs) and a fixed optimization budget, a checkpoint’s capacity loss is the loss from
fitting the checkpoint to the target at the end of the optimization budget. Usually, the capacity of a
deep RL agent is measured by its ability to fit the outputs of a model initialized randomly from the
same distribution as the agent on a fixed rollout collected by this target random model (Lyle et al.,
2022; Nikishin et al., 2023). We follow this practice. The data would in expectation be from the same
distribution as the agent’s initial checkpoint. To fit the critic, we use an L2 loss on the outputs of the
models. To fit the actor, we use a KL divergence between the target and the checkpoint (forward KL).

Deteriorating representations, collapse, and loss of trust

It is well-known that non-stationarity in deep RL can be a factor causing issues in representation
learning. However, most of the observations have been made in value-based methods showing that
value networks are prone to rank collapse, harming their expressivity, and in turn, the performance
of the agent (Lyle et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022). Non-stationarity has been shown to impact
PPO’s generalization Igl et al. (2021) and performance in the long run or in a continual learning
setting (Dohare et al., 2021, 2023a,b), but no evidence of representation deterioration was shown.
Our motivation is to reuse the tools that showed that value-based methods are prone to representation
collapse but in policy optimization methods for the first time. We focus on PPO for its popularity
and its non-stationarity which is impacted and can be controlled by multi-epoch optimization.

---Page Break---
Furthermore, a crucial question for PPO, compared to most value-based alternatives, is how the
regularization implicit in PPO through its trust region interacts with representation and performance
collapse. Intuitively it should prevent rapid degradation of the policy.

Experimental setup We begin our experiments by training PPO agents on the Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE)(Bellemare et al., 2013) for pixel-based observations with discrete actions and on
MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) for continuous observations with continuous actions. To keep our
experiments tractable, we choose the Atari-5 subset recommended by Aitchison et al. (2023) and add
Gravitar to include at least one sparse-reward hard-exploration game from the taxonomy presented
by Bellemare et al. (2016). For MuJoCo, we train on Ants, Half-Cheetahs, Humanoids, and Hoppers,
which have varying complexity and observation and output sizes. We use the same model architectures
and hyperparameters as popular implementations of PPO on ALE and MuJoCo (Raffin et al., 2021;
Huang et al., 2022b); these are also the architectures and hyperparameters used by Schulman et al.
(2017) in the original implementation of PPO; they do not include normalization layers. For MuJoCo
we further adopt a parameterization of the output action distribution using a TanhNormal4 with
both its mean and variance depending on the state representation as done by Haarnoja et al. (2018);
Andrychowicz et al. (2021). As we study the connection between performance and representation
dynamics this is a more natural choice than using the commonly implemented state-independent
variance which would be independent of representation dynamics. The ALE models use ReLU
activations (Nair & Hinton, 2010) and the MuJoCo ones tanh; we also experiment with ReLU on
MuJoCo. We use separate actor and critic models for both environments unless specified in Section 4.
Details on the performance metrics and tables of all environment parameters, model architectures,
and algorithm hyperparameters are presented in Appendix B. Observing that the previous findings on
the feature dynamics of value-based approaches (Gulcehre et al., 2022; Lyle et al., 2022) apply to the
critic of PPO as well since the loss function is the same, we focus on studying the feature dynamics
of the actor unless stated otherwise in the text or figures.

We vary the number of epochs as a tool to control the effects of non-stationarity, which gives the agent
a more significant number of optimization steps per rollout while not changing the optimal target it
can reach due to clipping, as opposed to changing the value of ϵ in the trust region for example.5 We
keep the learning rate constant throughout training and use the same learning rate for all the epoch
configurations.6 To understand the feature dynamics, we measure different metrics that are proposed
in the literature, including feature rank, number of dead neurons (Gulcehre et al., 2022), capacity loss
(Lyle et al., 2022), and penultimate layer pre-activation norm. Previous work has monitored feature
norm values as well (Abbas et al., 2023; Lyle et al., 2024); however, in our case, we found that as the
neurons in the policy network die, the feature norm might be stable while the pre-activation norm
blows up. All the metrics are computed on on-policy rollouts except for the capacity loss.

We run five seeds per hyperparameter configuration and report mean curves with min/max shaded
regions unless specified otherwise. All curves, except for capacity loss, are smoothed using an
exponentially weighted moving average with a coefficient of 0.05.

3.1
PPO suffers from deteriorating representations
Deteriorating representation How do the representation metrics of a PPO agent such as the feature
rank and the capacity loss, evolve during training? Are they subject to the same decline observed by
Kumar et al. (2021); Lyle et al. (2022) in value-based methods? Does it affect performance?

As illustrated in Figure 1 with ALE/Phoenix as an example, we observe a consistent increase in the
norm of the pre-activations of the feature layer of the policy network. Learning curves for all the
ALE games and MuJoCo tasks considered can be found in Appendix D. The increase in feature norm
is present in all the games/tasks considered in both environments, that is, with the two different model
architectures and activation functions in the case of MuJoCo. We associate the rapid growth in the
norm of the pre-activations with an eventual decline in the policy network’s feature rank. We observe
a rank decline in five out of six ALE games and seven out of eight MuJoCo tasks (four with ReLU
and three with tanh). The same observations about the increasing norm of the pre-activations can
be made about the critic network. However, its rank varies more with the sparsity of the reward: in

4We also provide evidence of collapse with the Gaussian distribution parameterization in the appendix.
5We show results with varying ϵ in Figure 34 of Appendix D.
6Although the environments we use are single-task environments to ablate additional MDP non-stationarity,
they are complex enough for the agents to keep improving when trained for longer than common benchmark
limits without annealing the learning rate.

---Page Break---
most environments, its rank experiences a significant deterioration after the policy’s performance
declines (not the policy’s rank) and rewards become sparser, and in the sparse-reward game Gravitar,
the critic’s rank collapses before the policy. Furthermore, capacity loss is increasing for the critic, as
observed in value-based plasticity studies (Lyle et al., 2022), and we also show that is the case for the
actor, for which it explodes around rank collapse.

Worse consequences How does increasing the number of epochs per rollout to vary non-stationarity
affect a PPO agent’s representation? Does it degrade as observed in DQN and SAC agents when
increasing the replay ratio (Nikishin et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022)?

Increasing the replay ratio in DQN and SAC deteriorates the agent’s representation and, in turn, its
performance (Kumar et al., 2022; D’Oro et al., 2023). This is commonly attributed to “overfitting” to
previous experience (Nikishin et al., 2022). Increasing the number of epochs in PPO is analogous,
and a natural hypothesis is that this would accelerate the deterioration of the policy’s representation.
Figure 1 shows that increasing the number of epochs accelerates the increase of pre-activations norm
and the decrease of the policy’s feature rank.7 In some cases, the rank eventually collapses, coinciding
with the policy’s performance collapse. We observe the performance collapse in three of the six ALE
games and three of the four MuJoCo tasks.

Figure 1: Deteriorating performance and representation metrics The policy network of a PPO-Clip agent on
ALE/Phoenix-v5 is subject to a deteriorating representation. The norm of the pre-activations of the penultimate
layer consistently increases, and its rank eventually decreases. Performing more optimization epochs per rollout
to increase the effects of non-stationarity accelerates the growth of the norm of the pre-activations and the
collapse of its rank. This ultimately leads to the collapse of the policy. This collapse is not driven by the value
network, whose rank is still high. Both network’s ability to fit arbitrary targets (capacity loss) is also worsening.

Figure 2: Rank collapse gives a high but trivial en-
tropy The rank collapse of the policy gives a policy with
high entropy but zero variance across states. The net-
work outputs the same high-entropy action distribution
in all states, as all the neurons in the feature layer are
dead. Its output only depends on the constant bias term.

Characterizing the collapse The collapse we
observe is distinct from the typical entropy col-
lapse. Figure 2 shows that the policy reaches a
high entropy. A high overall entropy can come
from an average of high-entropy states with dif-
ferent action distributions or trivially from the
same high-entropy distribution in all states. Our
analysis reveals the latter, a zero policy variance
across states. This corresponds to a collapsed
representation where most neurons are inactive.
8 The output thus relies solely on the bias term,
as linear weights act on a null feature vector,
making actions near uniform across all states
and collapsing performance on complex tasks.

3.2
Collapsed representations create trust issues and unrecoverable loss

Intuitively, the heuristic trust region set by PPO-Clip should prevent sudden catastrophic changes and
limit the rank collapse, which induces worse performance. However, empirically, it seems the trust
region cannot mitigate the collapse. In this section, we seek to understand the interaction between the
rank collapse and the trust region. We argue that as rank collapses, the clipping constraint becomes
unreliable and unable to restrict learning. This is in line with previous works that have pointed out

7The collapse happens with all epochs configurations when trained for long enough as seen in Figure 32,
increasing the number of epochs is a tool to observe the collapse earlier rather than a condition for it to happen.
8We consider a ReLU neuron as dead when its values are zero for all the samples in the batch and a tanh
neuron dead when its standard deviation across samples is less than 0.001.

that probability ratios during training can go beyond the clipping limits with PPO-Clip (Engstrom
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2022). We believe, however, that this behavior is systematic
when rank collapses and does not merely happen occasionally.

Wang et al. (2020, Theorem 2) state that when the gradients of the unclipped samples align with the
gradients of clipped samples, the clipped samples’ ratios will have their probabilities continue to go
beyond the clip limit. They claim this condition would hold in practice because of “optimization
tricks” or optimizer accumulated moments; however, there is no evidence that these factors induce
the gradient alignment or that the alignment is present in practice. Our intuition is that representation
degradation leads to alignment in the gradients and, therefore, a breakdown of the trust region
constraint. This can create a snowball effect, preventing PPO-Clip from preventing representation
collapse. We summarize this in two observations:

Loss of trust is extreme around poor representations The average of probability ratios outside
the clipping limits (below 1 −ϵ in Figure 3) significantly diverges from the clipping limit around
the collapse of the agent’s representation. This gives one more reason why the PPO trust region can
be violated. We isolate this in a toy setting and analyze it formally in the next section. We further
show in Figure 4 scatter plots of the lowest average probability ratios in runs with their associated
representation metrics.9 We observe no significant correlation in the regions where the representation
is rich (high rank, low pre-activation norm), but an apparent decrease of the average of probability
ratios below 1 −ϵ is observed as the representation reaches poor values. Note that we characterize the
collapsing regime by an extremely low rank, however, it is not straightforward to draw a line between
low-rank representations beneficial for generalization and extremely low-rank representations causing
aliasing as also acknowledged by Gulcehre et al. (2022), but for environments like Atari, our figures
seem to draw the line at single-digit ranks, which can be related to the action space of dimension 8+.

Figure 3: Focusing on individual runs Individual training curves on ALE/NameThisGame-v5 with different
epochs per batch. Extremely low ratios are observed around the representation collapse of a PPO-Clip agent,
implying that the heuristic trust region breaks down when representation power is lacking. The last-minibatch
value of the PPO objective decreases towards 0 around the representation collapse, implying a reduction in the
ability to improve the policy and recover, which is corroborated by the increase in capacity loss. (Ratios are
trivially above 1 −ϵ after collapse as a collapsed model does not change much to have values below 1 −ϵ.)

average of the probability ratios below the clipping limit vs. its corresponding average representation metric
(dead neurons, feature rank, feature norm). The average ratios are significantly lower around poor representations
(high dead neurons, low policy rank, high feature norm) reflecting the failure of the trust region in this regime.
Averages are over non-overlapping windows larger than episodes.

Loss of plasticity makes performance collapse unrecoverable The persistent decrease in perfor-
mance overlaps with a monotonic decrease in policy variance and PPO objective. It appears that as

the policy loses its ability to distinguish state, it can also ascend the PPO objective less and less at
each batch (recall: after collecting a batch, the loss starts around zero with a normalized advantage,
and through minibatch updates, the clipped policy advantage is ascended). Intuitively, this is implied
by a loss of plasticity or a collapse in entropy (no new actions to learn from). As seen in Section 2
the entropy does not collapse, and measuring the capacity loss in Figure 3 shows that the decrease in
objective gain is associated with a significant increase in capacity loss, implying loss of plasticity.

Connecting the dots Hence, around collapse, the representation of the policy is getting so poor
that it is impacting its ability to distinguish and act differently across states; the trust region cannot
prevent this catastrophic change as it also breaks down with a poor representation; finally, the policy’s
plasticity is also becoming so poor that the agent cannot recover by optimizing the surrogate objective.

Implications and discussion The causal connection we draw between the representation dynamics,
the trust region, and the performance primarily holds around the collapse regime and not necessarily
throughout training. However, this does not mean that one should only be concerned about the link
when performance is starting to deteriorate. The representations don’t collapse all of a sudden; they
deteriorate throughout training until they reach collapse. Thus, mitigating representation degradation
should happen throughout training and not only when around the collapsing regime. In addition, the
connection gives important insights into the failure mode of the popular PPO-Clip algorithm, whose
trust region is highly dependent on the representation quality, and more generally about trust-region
methods which only constrain the output probabilities.

3.2.1
A toy setting to understand the effects of rank collapse on trust region

We present a toy example that illustrates how a collapsed representation bypasses the clipping set
by PPO and cannot satisfy the trust region it seeks to set. PPO constructs a trust region around the
policy πθ(·|s) of the agent evaluated at a given state s, enforcing (in an approximate way) that the
update computed on state s can not move the policy πθ(·|s) outside of the trust region. However, the
constraint does not capture how updates computed on another state s′ affect the policy’s probability
distribution over the current state s. The underlying assumption is that updates computed on different
states are, at least in expectation, approximately orthogonal to each other, and they do not interact.
Therefore, restricting the update of the current state is sufficient to keep the policy within the region.

In our case, however, one can show that as the rank collapses or the neurons die, the representations
corresponding to different states become more colinear.10 Therefore, the gradients also become more
colinear. In the extreme case, when the rank collapses to 1, or there is only one neuron alive, all
representations are exactly colinear; therefore, all gradients are also. This means that even though
clipping prevents the policy πθ(·|s) on the current state s from changing due to the update of that
state ∇L(πθ(·|s)), πθ(·|s) will still change and move outside of the trust region due to the updates
on other states s′. Leading to the trust region constraint being ineffective and not constraining the
learning process in any meaningful sense. This gives a clear situation where the theorem of Wang
et al. (2020) holds and can easily be analyzed as below without resorting to the theorem for an
end-to-end proof or to get a better intuition.

on (x, a1) takes the probability of (y, a1) up and vice versa.
When one is above the threshold and should not increase, the
other still pushes it. Right (α < 0): a gradient on (x, a1) takes
the probability of (y, a1) down and vice versa. Both slow each
down, with one forcing the other to be lower than its initial value.

Formal statement of the toy setting
Let us consider a batch containing two
state-action pairs (x, a1) and (y, a1)
with sampled probabilities πold(a1|x)
and πold(a1|y) and positive estimated
advantages A(x, a1), A(y, a1) > 0. Let
ϕ(x), ϕ(y) ∈R be fixed 1-dimensional
representations of x, and y that can be
seen as the output of the (frozen) penul-
timate layer of a policy network with
collapsed representation (all but one
dead neuron), and let α ∈R such that
ϕ(y) = αϕ(x). Let θ = [θ1, θ2], be the
last layer of the network, computing the
logits of two actions, a1 and a2, that are
fed into a softmax to compute the probabilities. I.e., πθ(ai|s) =
eθiϕ(s)

minibatch updates alternating between (x, a1) and (y, a1). Ideally, the PPO loss increases πθ(a1|s)
at gradients on (x, a1) until it reaches the clip ratio and similarly on (y, a1). However, we show in
Appendix C that a gradient step in (x, a1) also affects πθ(a1|y) and depending on α will increase
it past its clipped ratio, or decrease it below its initial value. Essentially, when α ≥0, a gradient
on (x, a1) increases θnew
1
therefore increasing both πθnew(a1|x) and πθnew(a1|y). The same holds for
a gradient on (y, a1), causing one state to reach the clip limit first depending on α > 1 but still
have the other keep pushing its probability upwards. However, when α ≤0, a gradient on (x, a1)
increases θnew
1
therefore increasing πθnew(a1|x) but decreasing πθnew(a1|y). For a gradient on (y, a1)
it is the opposite: θnew
1
decreases therefore πθnew(a1|x) decreases and πθnew(a1|y) increases, causing
each state to reduce the probability of the other, and depending on α < 1 one of the probabilities
will dominate and push the other one down. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the probabilities when
simulating the updates empirically.

Intervening to regularize representations and non-stationarity

Having observed that PPO is affected by a frequent representation degradation that impacts its
trust region heuristic and causes its performance to collapse, we turn to study interventions that
aim at regularizing the representation of the policy network or reducing the non-stationarity in the
optimization. We investigate whether these interventions improve the representation metrics we
track and if in turn, this affects performance. We choose simple interventions that do not apply
modifications to the models during training (e.g., resetting or adding neurons) or require significantly
more memory (e.g., maintaining separate copies of the models). We perform interventions on the
games/tasks where the collapse is the most significant. We are interested in the state of the agent at
the end of the training budget. We record the performance and representation metrics for each run
as averages over the last 5% of training progress. We measure the excess ratio at a timestep as the
average probability ratio above 1 + ϵ divided by the average probability ratio below 1 −ϵ at that
timestep. This metric gives an idea of how much the policy exceeds the trust region. Its average value
is computed over the last 5% of training progress where the ratios are non-trivial, giving the same
window at the end of training as the other metrics when there is no collapse, otherwise a window
before total collapse covering 5% of training progress, as after collapse, the model does not change
anymore and the ratios are trivially within the 1 + ϵ and 1 −ϵ limits. We give additional details on
the computation of these aggregate metrics and the interventions performed in Appendix B.

PFO: Regularizing features to mitigate trust-region issues The motivation for our first intervention
and our proposed regularization method comes from our observation that the norm of the preactivation
features is consistently increasing, which can be linked to the trust-region issues discussed in Section 3.
We seek to mitigate this effect in a way that is analogous to the PPO trust region, by extending the
trust region to the feature space. We apply an L2 loss on the difference between the pre-activated
features of the optimized policy and the policy that collected the batch, as a way to keep the pre-
activations of the network during an update within a trust region. We apply this regularization to the
pre-activations and not the activations, as dead neurons cannot propagate gradients, and even when
they do, depending on the activation function, do so with a low magnitude. The regularization is an
additional loss/penalty added to the overall loss. We term this loss the Proximal Feature Optimization
(PFO) loss. With ϕθ(s) as the pre-activation of the penultimate layer of the actor πθ given a state s,

(2)

We apply two versions of PFO: one on only the penultimate layer’s pre-activations and one on all the
pre-activations until the penultimate layer. In the scope of this work, we do not tune the coefficient of
PFO; we pick the closest power of 10 that sets the magnitude of this loss to a similar magnitude of
the clipped PPO objective tracked on the experiments without intervention. This gives a coefficient of
1 for ALE, 1 for MuJoCo with tanh, and 10 with ReLU. The goal is not necessarily to obtain better
performance but to see if PFO improves the representations learned by PPO and if, in turn, it affects
its trust region and performance. As shown in Figure 6, the regularization of PFO effectively brings
the norm of the preactivation down, the number of dead neurons down, the capacity loss down, and
the rank up. This coincides with a significant decrease in the excess probability ratio, especially in the
upper tail. More importantly, we also see a significant increase in the lower tail of the returns where
no collapse in performance is observed anymore on ALE/NameThisGame and ALE/Phoenix, with a

8

slight increase in the upper tail showing that PFO can increase performance. Among the interventions
we have tried, PFO provided the most consistent improvements in representation and trust region.

Figure 6: Effects of regularizing features and non-stationarity Top & Middle: ALE/Phoenix-v5 &
ALE/NameThisGame-v5. Regularizing the difference between the features of consecutive policies with PFO
results in better representations, a lower trust-region excess, and mitigates performance collapse. The same
applies to sharing the actor-critic trunk. Bottom: ALE/Gravitar. Sharing the feature trunk between the actor and
the critic results in a worse policy representation as the value network is subject to rank collapse due to reward
sparsity. A boxplot includes 15 runs with different epochs.
Sharing the actor-critic trunk In deep RL, the decision to use the same feature network trunk
for both the actor and the critic is not trivial. Depending on the complexity of the environment, it
can significantly change the performance of a PPO agent (Andrychowicz et al., 2021; Huang et al.,
2022a). We, therefore, attempt to draw a connection between sharing the feature trunk, the resulting
representation, and its effects on the PPO objective. In this intervention, we make the actor and
the critic share all the layers except their respective output layers and backpropagate the gradients
from both the value and policy losses to the shared trunk. Figure 6 shows that the value loss acts as
a regularizer, which decreases the feature rank and, depending on the reward’s sparsity, gives two
distinct effects. In dense-reward environments such as ALE/Phoenix and ALE/NameThisGame, the
ranks are concentrated at low but non-trivial values: the upper tail significantly decreases compared
to the baselines while the lower tail increases. This coincides with a lower feature norm, lower
excess probability ratio, and, in turn, a high tail for the returns. It also increases performance in some
cases. However, the opposite is true in the sparse-reward environment Gravitar: the rank completely
collapses, and the feature norms and excess ratios are very high, collapsing the model’s performance.
This is consistent with the observations made in the plasticity works studying value-based methods:
they show that sparse rewards deteriorate the rank of the value network, and we show that when
shared in an actor-critic architecture they, in turn, deteriorate the policy. It is important to note that
this distinction using the reward sparsity holds when comparing environments from the same family
(e.g., ALE), but may not hold otherwise (e.g., comparing an ALE and a MuJoCo environment). We
provide training curves showing the difference in the evolution of the feature rank when sharing
the actor-critic trunk in Appendix D. To further strengthen this observation we run an intervention
on ALE/Phoenix (a dense reward environment), with a reward mask randomly masking a reward
with 90% chance, comparing the effects of sharing the actor-critic trunk. As expected, while with
dense rewards, sharing the trunk is beneficial in ALE/Phoenix (Appendix Figure 21), with the sparse
reward, the opposite is true: sharing the trunk is detrimental (Appendix Figure 35).

Adapting Adam Asadi et al. (2023) argue that as the targets of the value function change with the
changing policy rollouts, the old moments accumulated by Adam become harmful to fit the new
targets and find that resetting the moments of Adam helps performance in DQN-like algorithms. As
the PPO objective creates a dependency on the previous policy, and more generally, in the policy
gradient, the advantages change with the policy, the same argument about Adam moments can be
made for PPO. Furthermore, Dohare et al. (2023b); Lyle et al. (2023) advocate for decaying the
second moment of Adam faster than its default decay of 0.999 when training under non-stationarity

---Page Break---
and set it to match the decay of the first moment. Therefore, we experiment with both resetting
Adam’s moments after each batch collection (to avoid tuning its frequency) and setting the second
moment to decay at the (smaller) default decay of the first moment for both the actor and the critic; the
moments are thus only accumulated over the epochs on the same batch in the former and over shorter
batch sequences in the latter. We observe in Figure 6 and Appendix D that these interventions reduce
the feature norm and increase the feature rank on ALE, which also reduces the excess probability
ratio and, in some cases, improves performance; however, they are not sufficient to prevent collapse
and, like sharing the actor-critic trunk, result in poor performance on ALE/Gravitar.

Related Work

Our work is complementary to various other works studying the plasticity and representation dynamics
of neural networks trained under non-stationarity. Kumar et al. (2023) provide a comprehensive
comparison and categorization of methods used to mitigate plasticity loss in continual supervised
learning tasks and their effects on representations. Our work provides insights into the transferability
of some of these solutions to RL and tools to evaluate their impact on trust region methods. Sokar
et al. (2023) provide an alternative characterization of plasticity loss in RL using dormant neurons
and observe an increase in dormant neurons for non-stationary objectives. Abbas et al. (2023) study
representation metrics such as feature norms and observe a decrease of the norm due to dying neurons.
Like in the work of Lyle et al. (2022), both studies only include value-based methods. In this work,
we study dead units and capacity loss as Lyle et al. (2022) and provide corroboration of the dying
units phenomenon in policy optimization methods and, taking the dying neurons out of the equation,
find that the norm of preactivations actually blows up.

Other feature regularizations similar to PFO have been studied in value-based offline RL. Kumar et al.
(2022) propose DR3, which counteracts an implicit regularization in TD learning by minimizing
the dot product between the features of the estimated and target states. Ma et al. (2023) propose
Representation Distinction (RD) which tries to avoid unwanted generalization by minimizing the
dot product between the features of state-action pairs sampled from the learned policy and those
sampled from the dataset or an OOD policy. Both are related to PFO as the methods directly tackle an
undesired feature learning dynamic, but there is no motivation for DR3 or RD in online RL, and PFO
is conceptually different. The implicit regularization that DR3 counteracts is not present in on-policy
RL as shown by Kumar et al. (2022) in the SARSA experiment, and PFO differs from DR3 as it
extends a trust region rather than counteracts an implicit bias. Similarly, the overestimation studied
by Ma et al. (2023) in the vicious backup-generalization cycle is broken by on-policy data, and RD
regularizes state features between the learned policy and the dataset policy, not consecutive policies.

Conclusion and Discussion

Conclusion In this work, we provide evidence that the representation deterioration under non-
stationarity observed by previous work in value-based methods generalizes to PPO agents in ALE
and MuJoCo with their common model architectures and is connected to performance collapse. This
brings a novel perspective to previous works that showed that PPO agents lose plasticity throughout
training. We show that this is particularly concerning for the heuristic trust region set by PPO-Clip,
which fails to prevent collapse as it becomes less effective when the agent’s representation becomes
poor. Finally, we present Proximal Feature Optimization (PFO), a simple novel auxiliary loss based
on regularizing the evolution of features that mitigates representation degradation and, along with
other interventions, shows that controlling representation mitigates performance collapse.

Limitations and open questions In this work, we study the common architecture and optimizer of
PPO agents in ALE and MuJoCo consisting of relatively small models without normalization layers,
weight decay, or memory (e.g., not using Transformers and RNNs). Despite our best attempts, as with
any other empirical machine learning work, the generalization of our results to other settings is not
fully known. Still, this work should raise awareness about the representation collapse phenomenon
observed in PPO and encourage future work to monitor representations when training PPO agents, as
it can help diagnose performance collapse. We have focused on simple interventions that regularize
non-stationarity and representations to highlight the effects of non-stationarity and the connection
between representation, trust region, and collapse, but exploring interventions on plasticity is also
valuable, as these may also influence the same dynamics. We believe further studies to analyze
this problem, both empirically and particularly theoretically, to understand the reasons driving
representation deterioration to be valuable. We hope that our study encourages work in this direction.

A
Additional background

A.1
Reinforcement Learning

The undiscounted formulation presented in the background (Section 2) has also been used by
Schulman et al. (2015b) and does not limit the use of a discount factor to discount future rewards; for
that purpose, as we consider a finite-horizon setting, we can assume that discounting would already
be present in the reward which depends on time through the state. This allows to isolate the discount
factor γ for the purpose of the value estimation with GAE which serves as a trade-off between the
bias and the variance in the estimator, in addition to λ used for the λ-returns that combine multiple
n-step returns. More importantly, this also allows us to reuse the policy gradient and PPO losses
without discount factors, as the deep RL community is used to them while avoiding their incorrect
use in the discounted setting as pointed out by Nota & Thomas (2020). In any case, our results can
also be translated to the discounted setting using a biased gradient estimator (missing a discount
factor), being the typical setting considered in deep RL works.

Experiment details

B.1
Code and run histories

Our
codebase
is
publicly
available
at
https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/
no-representation-no-trust.
It includes the development environment distributed as a
Docker image for GPU-accelerated machines and a Conda environment for MPS-accelerated
machines, the training code, scripts to run all the experiments, and the notebook that generated the
plots. The codebase uses TorchRL (Bou et al., 2024) and provides a comprehensive toolbox to study
representation dynamics in policy optimization. We also provide modified scripts of CleanRL (Huang
et al., 2022b) to replicate the collapse observed in this work and ensure it is not a bug from our novel
codebase.

The code repository contains links to the Weights&Biases (W&B) project with all of our run histories,
a summary W&B report of the runs, and a W&B report with the replication with CleanRL.

Runs are fully reproducible on the same acceleration device on which they were run. In particular,
we have reproduced our results on three different clusters with the same NVIDIA GPU device.

B.2
Additional details on our experimental setup

We conduct experiments on an environment with pixel-based observations and discrete actions and
an environment with continuous observations and actions, each with a different model architecture.
For the discrete action case, we use the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)(Bellemare et al., 2013)
with the specification recommended by Machado et al. (2018) in v5 on Gymnasium (Towers et al.,
2023). That is, with a sticky action probability of 0.25 as the only form of environment stochasticity,
using only the game-over signal for termination (as opposed to end-of-life signals) with the default
maximum of 108 × 103 environment frames per episode and reporting performance over training
episodes (i.e., with sampling according to the policy distribution as opposed to taking the mode
action). We train all models for 100 million environment frames. We use standard algorithmic choices
to make our setting and results relevant to previous work. This includes taking only the sign of
rewards (clipping) and frame skipping. We use a frame skip of 3, as opposed to the standard value of
4, due to limitations in the ALE-v5 environment, which does not implement frame pooling.11 We use
the standard architecture of Mnih et al. (2015) consisting of convolutional layers followed by linear
layers, all with ReLU activations, and no normalization layers. We also use Mnih et al. (2015)’s
standard observation transformations with a resizing to 84x84, grayscaling, and a frame stacking of 4.

For the continuous case, we use MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) with v4 on Gymnasium (Towers
et al., 2023) with the default maximum of 1,000 environment frames to mark episode termination.
Similarly to Atari, we report performance as the average episode return over training episodes. We

11That is taking the max over the last two skipped and unskipped frames to capture elements
that only appear in even or odd frames of the game (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/
Arcade-Learning-Environment/issues/467). Using an odd frame skip value alleviates the issue.

15


---Page Break---
train all models for 5 million environment frames. We standardize the observations (subtract mean
and divide by standard deviation) according to an initial rollout of 4,000 environment steps (at least
four episodes). The standardization parameters are kept the same to avoid adding non-stationarity.
We use the same architecture as Schulman et al. (2017), with only linear layers, tanh activations, and
no normalization layers. We also experiment with ReLU activations. The network outputs a mean
and a standard deviation (with softplus), both conditioning on the observation independently for each
action dimension, which are then used to create a TanhNormal distribution, similarly to Haarnoja
et al. (2018).

To measure the capacity loss of a checkpoint, we use the same optimization hyperparameters used to
train the checkpoint, i.e. the same batch size and learning rate. The optimizer is reconstructed from
its initial state (loading the optimizer state is also a valid design choice). The dataset sizes and fitting
budgets for capacity are listed in Tables 2 and 3.

We provide a high-level pseudocode for PPO in Algorithm 1 and list all hyperparameters considered
in Tables 2 and 3.

Additional details on metrics used in the figures

Training curves A point in the training curves in Figures 1, 2, 3, before aggregating seeds and
smoothing, corresponds to an average value over the last batch collected at the time of logging for
metrics available at every batch (feature rank, entropy, etc.) or the latest batch where the metric was
available at the time of logging for the episodic return (as it’s only available when episodes finish, and
it requires multiple batches to finish an episode). E.g., in Figure 1 on ALE, a feature rank corresponds
to the average feature rank over all the states in the last batch collected at the time of logging and is
logged every 0.1% of the batches (i.e. every 6,144 env steps); A return corresponds to the average
return across all workers that had episodes finished in the latest batch containing finished episodes at
the time of logging.

Figure 4 A window of size 1% of training progress represents approximately 1 million training steps
on ALE and 50,000 training steps on MuJoCo We average the metrics per window and then take the
20 windows with the lowest average probability ratios below 1 −ϵ. The probability ratios in a run
can be trivially within the 1 −ϵ region after the model collapses, resulting in less than 20 points if the
model collapses before 20% of the training progress. When all runs give 20 points, we can observe
300 points in total per scatter plot.

Figure 6 A window of size 5% of training progress represents approximately five million training
steps in ALE and captures at least five episodes per environment so in total at least 40 episodes. For
MuJoCo this represents approximately 256,000 training steps and captures at least 128 episodes per
environment so in total at least 256 episodes.

When a model collapses, it typically doesn’t change anymore so its optimization trivially gives ratios
within the clipping limits (no value above 1 + ϵ and below 1 −ϵ is logged). In that case, we are
more interested in the evolution of the excess ratio before the ratios become trivial. Therefore, the
upper limit of the 5% of training progress is taken such that it is the latest timestep where there are
at least 10 non-trivial ratios, i.e. 10 logged excess ratios. This coincides with a window before the
collapse of the model capturing the values we are interested in. Note that when a model collapses
this window may not coincide with the window used to report the other metrics such as the average
return, however, these other metrics typically do not change after a collapse, so it is more robust to
capture them at the end of training rather than looking for an arbitrary window after the collapse. We
give training curves similar to Figure 1 with the interventions performed.

In MuJoCo, with continuous action distributions the ratios diverge to infinity and 0 before collapse
therefore to get meaningful plots, we clip average probability ratios above 1 + ϵ and below 1 −ϵ to
1012 and 10−12, respectively, before computing the average excess ratio.

We group the different epoch configurations of an intervention on the same environment, giving 15
runs per boxplot (three epochs with five seeds each). The right (resp. left) whiskers are determined
by the highest (resp. lowest) observed datapoint below Q3 + 1.5 IQR (default of Matplotlib). The
outliers are points outside of the whiskers.

B.4
Statistical significance

Stochasticity in our experiments arises from network initialization, environment transitions (e.g.,
sticky actions in ALE), agent action sampling, and minibatch sampling for optimization. A seed
fully controls the sequence of randomness in a run with the same hyperparameter configuration. We
repeat each configuration with five seeds using the same collection of seeds, resulting in the same
initialization of the networks and environments for a given seed across configurations. This form
of repeated measures allows us to compare the configurations with lower variance as they share the
same initial conditions, hence requiring a lower number of seeds.

In Figures 1 and 2, we aggregate the five runs of each experiment into mean curves with min/max
shaded areas. The use of min/max error bars allows us to demonstrate the full range of observed
outcomes, although it may result in shaded areas that overlap more than with other types of error
bars. Most of the claims we make based on those figures do not rely on non-overlapping shaded areas
and are instead stronger when the max or min boundaries are consistent with the observation made

17


---Page Break---
(min boundary of feature norm increasing, max boundary of feature rank decreasing). Otherwise,
we made comparative claims when shaded areas did not overlap (feature rank decreasing faster with
more epochs and more non-stationarity).

Figure 3 displays individual seeds to zoom on single-run dynamics around collapse. It is used for
an illustrative purpose to provide intuition and does not depend on the number of runs or statistical
aggregation of results. The main claim made with the intuition (breakdown of the trust region) is
backed by Figure 4, which includes 300 points per plot per environment, subsampled from 15 training
curves per environment.

To evaluate the effects of the interventions in Figure 6, we show boxplots to give a complete idea
of the distribution of the data which is formed by grouping the different configurations in the same
environment. Each boxplot contains 15 runs. We make claims such as preventing collapse using
the tails and medians and claims about lower excess ratio and higher rank using the interquartile
range. Without a clear intuition about the distribution of combined configurations per environment,
we consider this approach appropriate for comparing interventions.

In summary, we believe our experimental design provides a balanced tradeoff between statistical
significance and richness of claims. The computational cost of running more seeds may not yield
proportionately valuable insights.

B.5
Hardware and runtime

The experiments in this project took a total of ~11,300 GPU hours on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs
(ALE) and ~25,500 CPU hours (MuJoCo). A run on ALE takes around 10 hours on an A100 and 16
hours on a V100. A run on MuJoCo takes around 5 hours on 6 CPUs.

Figure 7: Figure 1 on ALE. QBert is the only game where rank decline and collapse are not observed, apart from
an outlier run that collapsed at initialization. The performance of the policy should be taken into consideration
when comparing the capacity loss of the critic. E.g., for Phoenix, the capacity loss of the critic associated with
the policy that doesn’t collapse ends up higher than that of the policies that do collapse.

Figure 11: Figure 2 on MuJoCo with the tanh acti-
vation. With a continuous action distribution, the
policy variance can either drop or explode. Dead
neurons for the tanh activation are hard to compute
as they are dependent on an arbitrary threshold.

Figure 15: Figure 4 ALE. Qbert and Gravitar do not have runs with poor representation regions (dead neurons

beginning of the training and kept a high (but lower than 510) number of dead neurons and a trivial rank, but a
low excess ratio.

Gravitar

Figure 18: Figure 6 on ALE. The tails of the capacity loss on Phoenix with interventions can be higher than
without interventions on the runs where the models collapse too early without interventions, leading to the
capacity loss of the non-collapsed models with interventions eventually becoming higher. This can be observed
from the training curves with interventions. Nevertheless, their medians are lower.

Measuring and comparing rank dynamics

Several matrix rank approximations have been used in the deep learning literature, and more specifi-
cally the deep RL literature, to measure the rank of the representation of features learned by a deep
network. In complement to the background presented in section 2, we give here all the rank metrics
we have tracked in this work and their correlations, showing that although their absolute values differ,
their dynamics tend to describe the same evolution.

E.1
Definitions of different rank metrics

Essentially, the main difference between the rank metrics considered in the literature is whether they
apply a relative thresholding of the singular values or an absolute one. Their implementation can be
found under src/po_dynamics/modules/metrics.py in our codebase.

Referring by Φ the N × D matrix of representations as in Section 2, and letting δ = 0.01 be the
threshold, and ⟨σi(Φ), . . . , σD(Φ)⟩the singular values of Φ in decreasing order, the different rank
definitions are as follows.

Effective rank (Roy & Vetterli, 2007) A relative measure of the rank. Let H(p1, . . . , pk) denote
the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution over k events and ∥σ∥1 be the sum of the singular
values. Let ˜σi(Φ) = σi(Φ)

∥σ∥1 be the normalized singular values. The effective rank is

exp(H(˜σ1(Φ), . . . , ˜σD(Φ))}

This rank measure has also been used in deep learning by Huh et al. (2023).

Approximate rank (PCA) A relative measure of the rank. Intuitively this rank measures the number
of PCA values that together explain 99% of the variance of the matrix. This can also be viewed as
the lowest-rank reconstruction of the feature matrix with an error lower than 1%. 12 It is also used in
RL by Yang et al. (2020).

)

srank (Kumar et al., 2021) A relative measure of the rank. This is a relative thresholding of the
singular values, similar to the approximate rank but with no connection to low-rank reconstruction or
variance of the feature matrix.

of the normalized Φ that are larger than a threshold δ.

PyTorch rank An absolute measure of the rank.
This is the rank computed by
torch.linalg.matrix_rank and torch.linalg.matrix_rank. Let ϵ be the smallest differ-
ence possible between points of the data type of the singular values, i.e. for torch.float32 that is
1.19209e−7. This rank is computed as follows.



 σi(Φ)

It also appears in Press et al. (2007) in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear least squares.

E.2
Correlations between the rank metrics

We compute various correlation coefficients and distance measures between the rank metrics. To
compute a correlation/distance on a pair of rank metrics (X, Y ), we take for each training run the set
{(xt, yt)t ∈{0, ..., T}} of coinciding values of the curves of the two rank metrics during the run that
had T logged steps, compute the correlation/distance on this set, and average the correlation/distance
values across all considered runs. We also compute the worst correlation/distance between each
rank metric pair for a worst-case analysis. We separate the average values and worst-case values
by environment (ALE vs. MuJoCo) for a more granular analysis. We consider all the runs without
the interventions and exclude a few runs where the models collapse since the beginning of training,
giving constant trivial ranks, as these result in undefined or trivial correlation coefficients.

We compute Kendall’s τ coefficient (Kendall, 1938), Spearman’s ρ coefficient (Spearman, 1987), the

Pearson correlation coefficient, and a normalized L2-distance computed as
√PT
t=1(xt−yt)2

√

T ×L
where L
is the width of the feature layer considered (i.e., 512 for ALE and 64 for MuJoCo).

Results We visualize the correlation/distance between the pairs of ranks as heatmaps annotated with
averages and standard deviations. Overall, the metrics are highly correlated with average correlation
the coefficients varying between 0.99 and 0.51. Individually, no rank metric correlates significantly
more on average with the other metrics. Interestingly, from the average correlations, we clearly see
two consistent clusters of stronger correlations between the relative rank metrics (approximate rank
(PCA) and Effective rank (Roy & Vetterli, 2007)) and absolute rank metrics (Feature Rank (Lyle
et al., 2022) and PyTorch rank). The srank (Kumar et al., 2021) which is technically a relative metric,
but with a weak normalization rationale, correlates more with the relative metrics on MuJoCo with
tanh but more with the absolute metrics on ALE and MuJoCo with ReLU.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Using the numbered contributions and claims in the introduction, we provide
evidence for claims 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4, and Appendix B.1, respectively.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Limitations are discussed in Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

42


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Proofs relative to Section 3.2.1 are presented in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We list all the experimental details in Appendix B and provide a fully repro-
ducible codebase.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

43


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide a fully reproducible codebase with instructions in Appendix B.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe our experimental setup in Section 3 and give details in Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss statistical significance in Appendix B.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss computing resources in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper addresses a fundamental algorithmic issue with no specific applica-
tion. The impact of any application should be discussed specifically when introducing the
application.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

45


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The codebase implements already existing algorithms and training curves do
not pose such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All the assets used have been cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

46


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduce a codebase and run histories documented in Appendix B.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

47


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
