may observe that the scale of the 3D scene is closely related to the objects (and their typical sizes) populating it.

Abstract

We propose a method for metric-scale monocular depth estimation. Inferring depth
from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of scale from perspective
projection during the image formation process. Any scale chosen is a bias, typically
stemming from training on a dataset; hence, existing works have instead opted
to use relative (normalized, inverse) depth. Our goal is to recover metric-scaled
depth maps through a linear transformation. The crux of our method lies in
the observation that certain objects (e.g., cars, trees, street signs) are typically
found or associated with certain types of scenes (e.g., outdoor). We explore
whether language descriptions can be used to transform relative depth predictions
to those in metric scale. Our method, RSA, takes as input a text caption describing
objects present in an image and outputs the parameters of a linear transformation
which can be applied globally to a relative depth map to yield metric-scaled depth
predictions. We demonstrate our method on recent general-purpose monocular
depth models on indoors (NYUv2, VOID) and outdoors (KITTI). When trained
on multiple datasets, RSA can serve as a general alignment module in zero-shot
settings. Our method improves over common practices in aligning relative to metric
depth and results in predictions that are comparable to an upper bound of fitting
relative depth to ground truth via a linear transformation. Code is available at:

Introduction

3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from images is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of a dimension
through perspective projection during the image formation process: Any point along the ray of
projection can yield the same image coordinate. This extra degree of freedom is often addressed
by using multiple images of the same scene, such as stereo or video. While an additional image
(assuming co-visible sufficiently exciting textures across both images) allows one to triangulate
unique points in space, a scale ambiguity exists with the absence of camera calibration, measurements
from an additional sensor (e.g., range, initial), or a strong prior (e.g. a supervised training set). One
may argue that, such additional information should already be available during data collection. Still,
modern large-scale training [44, 67] often utilizes data from diverse sources with drastically diverse
setups, making resolving the scale ambiguity issue crucial.

When it comes to monocular depth estimation, which predicts a dense depth map from a single image,
the problem is also ill-posed in that one cannot measure the distance from the camera from a single
view. Hence, to make inference possible, one must rely on the existence of a training set. While
one option is to “bake in” an additional bias of scale by training on a number of different datasets
(indoors and outdoors) and attributing depth to pixel intensities, these dataset-specific biases come at
the cost of generalization, limiting model transfer from one domain (indoor) to another (outdoor), let
alone mixing multiple data sources. Existing monocular depth methods resort to predicting relative
(normalized, inverse) depth to factor out the scale biases, but leave behind practical utility, as a
trade-off, in downstream applications in spatial tasks such as manipulation, planning, and navigation.

We consider whether an additional modality can be used to resolve the scale ambiguity in single-image
3D reconstruction, i.e., transforming scaleless relative depth to metric depth. One might observe
that natural (including man-made) scenes do not occur by chance, but rather by design, with the
regularity of object-scene co-occurrences [18, 28]: Certain scenes (e.g., outdoors) are composed
of certain categories of objects (e.g., cars, trees, buildings) and associated with a certain order of
magnitude in scale (e.g. tens of meters). Hence, we hypothesize that language, in the form of text
captions or descriptions, can be used to infer the scale of the 3D scene and to transform relative depth
to metric depth. The choice of language also has practical value in that it does not require costly data
acquisition with an additional synchronized and calibrated sensor (e.g., lidar, time-of-flight). With
publicly available pre-trained panoptic segmentation or object detection models, image captioners,
and vision-language models, one can automate the data acquisition, training, and inference process.
Nonetheless, they are not a necessary part of the work, but may facilitate ease of use, to simulate the
language description provided by human users in practical scenarios.

To test the feasibility of our hypothesis, we consider monocular depth estimation, where a strong
prior is necessary for inference; this prior may come from an image, or an independent modality such
as language. Specifically, we consider monocular depth models belonging to the general-purpose,
relative depth estimation paradigm to control for side effects such as the scale learned along with
shapes in existing works that focus on predicting metric depth for a specific dataset. To this end,
we assume access to a pre-trained scaleless monocular depth estimation model; aside from a set of
images, we also assume text captions describing them. As the standard procedure to factor out scale
is to normalize through a linear transformation, we propose to learn a parameterized function that
predicts the parameters of a linear transformation based on the text description. Applying them to a
relative depth map and inverting its values will transform it to a metric-scaled depth map to resolve
the scale ambiguity. We term our method RSA, as an acronym for “Resolving Scale Ambiguities”.

In one mode, like existing works that also transform relative to metric depth, albeit with images
and domain-specific scaling [3], we train specific models of RSA for specific datasets (e.g., NYUv2
[46], KITTI [15], VOID [58]). In another mode, when trained on multiple datasets across different
domains, RSA generalizes well and can not only handle images sampled from the datasets it was
trained on, but also those from novel datasets in a zero-shot manner. The use of language, which
is invariant to illumination, object orientation, occlusion, scene layout, etc., many of the nuisance
variables that vision algorithms are sensitive to, demonstrates a promising avenue for general-purpose
relative to metric scale recovery to complement the growing works in monocular depth estimation. We
evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, where we improve over common practices
in aligning relative depth to metric scale. We show that using RSA is comparable to matching relative
depth via a linear transformation to the ground truth, or scaling using the median value of the ground
truth, both of which are considered oracle relative to metric recovery methods.

Our contributions are as follows: (i) We proposed a novel formulation of the relative to metric
depth transfer. (ii) We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring scale from language and as a general
alignment module. (iii) We performed extensive experiments to validate performance on indoor
and outdoor domains, sensitivity to text caption, and zero-shot generalization. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to use language as a means of relative to metric depth alignment.

Related Work

Monocular depth estimation using metric depth. Metric depth models learn to infer pixel-wise
depth in metric scale (i.e. meters) by minimizing loss between depth predictions and ground-truth
depth maps [2, 12, 26, 35, 55, 71, 79]. Each model typically applies to only one data domain in
which it is trained, with similar camera parameters and object scales. Specifically, DORN [12]
leverages a spacing-increasing discretization technique. AdaBins [2] partitions depth ranges into
adaptive bins. NeWCRFs [71] uses neural window fully-connected CRFs to compute energy. When
ground-truth depth is not available, self-supervised approaches [4, 11, 23, 27, 30, 38, 41, 51, 52,
53, 59, 61, 70, 74, 80, 81, 84, 86] rely on geometric constraints, where scale is attributed through
lidar [10, 37, 40, 57, 56, 58, 63, 68], radar [47], binocular images [14, 17, 16], or inertials [20, 54].
However, models that predict metric depth are limited to specific datasets or scenes, and sensors [60];
thus, they do not generalize well. RSA aims to serve as a general alignment module that can predict
metric depth based on relative depth across different domains.

Monocular depth estimation using relative depth. Trained across different domains, self-supervised
depth estimators trained with multi-view photometric objects produce up-to-scale predictions that
are linearly correlated with their absolute depth values across the domain [8, 5, 20, 21, 54, 62, 64],
thus requiring scaling of their depth prediction. However, due to the scale-ambiguity of multi-view
photometric objective, such models are normally evaluated by aligning predictions to ground-truth at
test time (typically median-scaling [16, 17, 86]), at the expense of practicality since ground-truth
might not be feasible during real-world application. To enable generalization across different scenes,
some (semi-) supervised depth models trained with single images adopt image-level normalization
techniques to generate affine-invariant depth representations (i.e. relative depth) [24, 43, 44, 67, 73].
HND [73] hierarchically normalizes the depth representations with spatial information and depth
distributions. Depth Anything [67] learns from large-scale automatically annotated data. DPT [43]
leverages vision transformers using a scale- and shift-invariant trimmed loss. MiDas [44] mixes
multiple datasets with training objectives invariant to depth range and scale. Marigold [24] associates
fine-tuning protocol with a diffusion model. However, by definition, relative depth is scaleless, which
limits their applications that require metric scaled reconstruction. Our proposed RSA addresses this
limitation by grounding relative depth into a metric scale, enabling metric scale 3D reconstruction.

Relative to metric depth transfer. To transform the predicted relative depth into metric depth
for evaluation and real-world application, ZoeDepth [3] fine-tunes a metric bins module on each
metric depth dataset to output metric depth. Depth Anything [67] follows ZoeDepth [3] using a
decoder where a metric bins module computes per-pixel depth bin centers that are linearly combined
to output the metric depth. MiDas [44] and Marigold [24] use linear fit to align predictions and
ground truth in scale and shift for each image in inverse-depth space based on the least-square
criterion before measuring errors. DPT [43] fine-tunes a global scale and shift on metric depth
datasets. DistDepth [62] conducts transfer by leveraging left-right stereo consistency to integrate
metric scale into a scale-agnostic depth network. ZeroDepth [21] achieves transformation using
input-level geometric embedding to learn an indoor scale prior over objects via a variational latent
representation. However, metric decoders are limited to specific datasets, and aligning scale and
shift of predictions requires ground truth during test time. RSA produces scale using text to transfer
relative depth to metric depth across domains and does not require ground truth during test time.

Language model for monocular depth estimation. Vision-Language models [6, 32, 33, 39, 42, 49]
acquire a comprehensive understanding of languages and images through pre-training under diverse
datasets, thus forming an effective baseline for downstream tasks [34, 65, 69, 76, 78, 79, 88, 66, 50].
Typically, CLIP [42] conducts contrastive learning between text-image pairs, empowering various
tasks like few-shot image classification [13, 75, 77, 85], image segmentation [45, 83], object
detection [45, 87], and 3D perception [22, 76, 79, 88]. In light of their emerging ability, some
works [1, 22, 79, 82] have tried to apply vision-language models for monocular depth estimation.
WorDepth [72] learned the distribution 3D scenes from text captions. DepthCLIP [79] leverages the

narrow the depth domain gap. Auty et al. [1] modifies DepthCLIP [79] using continuous learnable
tokens in place of discrete human-language words. In contrast, RSA uses language to directly predict
scale, which serves as an explicit scaling constraint by transforming relative depth into metric scale.

Method

We consider a dataset D = {I(n), t(n), y∗(n)}N
n=1 with N samples of synchronized RGB image,
text descriptions, depth maps, where I : Ω⊂R2 7→R3 denotes an image, y∗: Ω⊂R2 7→R+
the ground-truth metric depth map, t a text description of the image, and Ωthe image space. We
assume access to a pretrained monocular depth estimation model hθ for the purpose of learning the
parameters to predict the transformation between relative and metric depth. Given an RGB image,
a monocular depth estimation model predicts inverse relative depth y : Ω⊂R2 7→R+ using a
parameterized function h realized as a neural network, i.e., y := hθ(·). To recover metric-scale from
(scaleless) inverse relative depth, we consider a global linear transformation through the use of a
language description pertaining to the image of the 3D scene. Given the text description t of an image
as input, our method, RSA, predicts a pair of scalars denoting the scale and shift parameters of the
transformation: (ˆα, ˆβ) = gψ(t) ∈R2. The metric depth prediction is obtained by ˆy = 1/(ˆα · y + ˆβ).

RSA. To infer the parameters of the linear transformation to align relative depth to metric scale, we
employ the existing pretrained CLIP text encoder [42] as a feature extractor. Having been trained on a
large scale dataset, CLIP offers an latent space suitable to preprocess object-centric text descriptions.
We note that CLIP text encoder is frozen within RSA. Given text descriptions t = {t1, t2, ...}, we
first encode them into text embeddings and feed them into a 5-layer shared multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) to project them into k = 256 hidden dimensions followed by two separate sets of 5-layer
MLPs, one serves as the output head ψˆα : Rk 7→R+ for scale parameter ˆα and the other as the
output head ψ ˆβ : Rk 7→R+ for shift ˆβ parameter. Scale and shift are assumed to be positive in favor
of optimization. For ease of notation, we refer to ψ as the parameters for the shared MLP as well as
the output heads, where (ˆα, ˆβ) = gψ(t).

Optimizing RSA involves minimizing a supervised loss with respect to ψ, which requires a forward
pass of a given training image I(n) through the monocular depth model to yield y(n) = hθ(I(n)). To
ensure that the monocular depth model does not drift and update its parameters during the training of
RSA, we freeze θ while optimizing for ψ. Hence, training entails minimizing an L1 loss:

where ˆy(n) = 1/(ˆα(n) · y(n) + ˆβ(n)) denotes the predicted metric-scale depth aligned from relative
depth y(n), x ∈Ωdenotes an image coordinate, and M : Ω7→{0, 1} denotes a binary mask
indicating valid coordinates in the ground truth depth y∗with values greater than zero.

Text prompt design. To test our hypothesis, we require text descriptions to be paired with images. As
standard benchmarks do not provide the text description of each image, we extend existing datasets by
associating each image with several text descriptions. To achieve this, we propose to use off-the-shelf
models to generate different kinds of text. First, we considered structured text, which adheres to a

certain template. We use a panoptic segmentation model MaskDINO [31] to extract the significant
objects and background in the image. For an input image I, the segmentation model returns a set
of B object and background instances {n(i), c(i)}B
i=1, where c(i) denotes the class of the object or
background, and n(i) denotes the number of instances of the object or background. Using the set of
instances, a structured caption for an image I can be obtained: “ An image with n(1) c(1), n(2) c(2),
..., n(B) c(B). ” We will shuffle the order of instances to produce 5 different structured captions for
each image. Then we consider the natural text, where the text doesn’t adhere to certain templates and
is closer to human descriptions, we use two visual question-answering models LLaVA v1.6 Vicuna
and LLaVA v1.6 Mistral [36]. For each model, we prompt it with the input image and a prompt,
asking the model to describe the image. For each model, we provide 5 different prompts to produce
different natural captions. During training, in each iteration, for a given image, we randomly select
one caption from those 15 captions to predict scale and shift.

Experiments

Datasets. We present our main result on three datasets: NYUv2 [46] and VOID [58] for indoor
scenes, and KITTI [15] for outdoor scenes. NYUv2 contains images with a resolution of 480×640
where depth values from 1 × 10−3 to 10 meters. We follow [29, 35, 79] for the dataset partition,
which contains 24,231 train images and 654 test images. VOID contains images with a resolution
of 480×640 where depth values from 0.2 to 5 meters. It contains 48,248 train images and 800 test
images following the official splits [58]. KITTI contains images with a resolution of 352×1216 where
depth values from 1 × 10−3 to 80 meters. We adopt the Eigen Split [9] consisting of 23,488 training
images and 697 testing images. Following [2, 71], we remove samples without valid ground truth,
leaving 652 valid images for testing. We also report zero-shot generalization results on SUN-RGBD
[48], which contains 5050 testing images, and DDAD [19], which contains 3950 validation images.

Table 2: Quantitative results on KITTI Eigen Split. RSA (yellow), especially when trained with multiple
datasets, generalizes better than using images to predict the transformation parameters. Please refer to Table 1
for more details about notations.

Depth models. For DPT [43], we use DPT-Hybrid fine-tuned for NYUv2 and KITTI respectively,
with 123M parameters. We used the one fine-tuned on NYUv2 for VOID. For MiDas [44], we
use MiDaS 3.1 Swin2_large-384 with 213M parameters. For DepthAnything [67], we use Depth-
Anything-Small with 24.8M parameters. Different from our setting, DepthAnything evaluates using
ZoeDepth [3]’s depth decoder that is separately fine-tuned on NYUv2 and KITTI to produce a
pixel-wise scale, and MiDas evaluates by aligning prediction with ground truth in scales and shifts.
We re-implement several baselines aligning with the setting of predicting a global scale and shift for
scaling relative depth, provided in Table 1 and 2.

Hyperparameters. We use the Adam [25] optimizer without weight decay. The learning rate is
reduced from 3 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−5 by a cosine learning rate scheduler. The model is trained for
50 epochs under this scheduler. We run our experiment on GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs, with 24GB
memory. For reference, if using a single GPU, the training time for RSA with DepthAnything on
jointly NYUv2, KITTI, and VOID for 50 epochs takes 57 hours..

Evaluation metrics. We follow [7, 35, 79] to evaluate using mean absolute relative error (Abs Rel),
root mean square error (RMSE), absolute error in log space (log10), logarithmic root mean square
error (RMSElog) and threshold accuracy (δi).

Quantitative results. We show results on NYUv2 in Table 1, KITTI in Table 2, and VOID in Table
3, where we improve over baselines across all evaluation metrics and approach the performance
of using ground truth for scaling. Following DPT, we optimize the scale and shift for the “Global”
scaling baseline over the training set and use it for evaluation (i.e., same scale and shift for all test
samples). We obtain the “Image” baseline by substituting CLIP text features with CLIP image
features. Following [44], we perform a linear regression to find the scale and shift that minimizes the
least-square error between the ground truth metric depth and the predicted metric depth. Additionally,
we also test median scaling [17], a common practice for evaluation, which uses the ratio between
the median of depth prediction and ground truth as the scaling factor. Both linear fitting and median
scaling are shown to demonstrate what is achievable if one were to directly fit to ground truth. We
train separate RSA models for each dataset, as well as a unified RSA model combining both KITTI
and NYUv2, or all KITTI, NYUv2, and VOID.

Table 3: Quantitative results on VOID. In zero-shot generalization and multi-dataset training (including the
target dataset), RSA outperforms image scaling due to the robustness of text, which supports better generalization.
Please refer to Table 1 for more details about notations.

Figure 3: Left: Predicted inverse scale w.r.t. median
depth ground truth. Larger scenes tend to have larger
median ground truth depth. For RSA trained on com-
bined KITTI and NYUv2 with Depth Anything model,
we fit an inverse proportional function for the predicted
inverse scale in the test set (each point is an image), to
verify that the scale is proportional to the median depth,
that larger scenes are predicted with larger scales.

Although RSA trained on a single dataset may achieve slightly better performance than the unified
model, the difference is minimal. In some metrics, the unified model even outperforms, demonstrating
the generalizability of using language as input, given the narrow domain gap for language. Addition-
ally, RSA models consistently outperform “Image” baselines in both in-domain and cross-domain
scenarios and are comparable with existing methods under various settings. Our method significantly
narrows the performance gap to that of using ground truth for scaling, validating the effectiveness of
using language instead of the input image to predict scale.

To examine our scale predictions in more detail, Figure 3 shows a curve fitting plotted for our
predicted (inverse) scale against the median of the ground truth. The trend line shows that the scale
inferred from text descriptions matches well with median scaling, which is a robust estimator.

Qualitative comparisons. We present representative visual examples comparing RSA with the
baseline method on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively, to highlight
the benefits of RSA. The error maps illustrate the absolute relative error. Unlike the original DPT,
which uses a fixed scale and shift, RSA enhances accuracy uniformly across the image without
altering the structure or fine details of the depth map. This improvement is evidenced by the darker
areas in the error maps, indicating better scaling and reduced errors.

Zero-shot Generalization. Considering the smaller domain gap in language descriptions across
various scenes, we perform a zero-shot transfer experiment to demonstrate RSA’s generalization
ability. We evaluate the models on the Sun-RGBD [48] and DDAD [19] without fine-tuning. As
shown in Table 4 and Table 5, RSA achieves superior results compared to baselines, existing methods,
and ground truth scaling. This suggests that language descriptions offer a viable option for relative to
metric transfer when generalizing across diverse data domains. Note that a single global scale and
shift are ineffective for both indoor and outdoor settings. Therefore, for the “Global” model, we fit it
only to NYUv2 to obtain a reasonable global scale and shift for the zero-shot Sun-RGBD evaluation,
and fit it to KITTI for DDAD evaluation.

Prompt design for input text. In Table 6, we investigate different designs of RSA text prompts in
training and how they affect the performance. Here, to make the experiment more controllable, we
use only structured text and only produce one caption for each image to train each model.

Table 4: Zero-shot generalization to SUN-RGBD. With more training datasets for scale prediction, RSA model
generalizes better due to the robustness of text, but predicting scale using images suffers from domain gaps
among training images. The models are tested on the Sun-RGBD without any fine-tuning. For ZoeDepth, X
indicates no pre-training, and M12 indicates 12 datasets for pre-training. ZoeDepth results were taken from their
original manuscripts, using a depth decoder for scaling. Please refer to Table 1 for detailed notations.

In the 1st and 2nd rows of Table 6, we use an object detector Detic [87] to produce only foreground
objects in images and form input text using only foreground objects. We observe that if the input
text only specifies the types of objects and their numbers, RSA can still accurately predict the scale
for indoor scenes, as these spaces are typically filled with various pieces of furniture. However, this
approach performs poorly for outdoor scenes, which tend to be more open and sparse. For instance,
parking lots of different sizes may contain varying numbers of cars: a small lot may be crowded,
while a large lot may appear empty. In the 3rd and 4th rows of Table 6, we use text formed using
segmentation results; we observe that after including background classes, the model works better

especially for outdoor scenes, since different backgrounds (like wall, sidewalk, highway, road, sky,
house, building) can reflect different scales.

Sensitivity to different text input. To demonstrate the impact of various text inputs on scale
prediction, we utilize a trained RSA model based on the DepthAnything model. By altering the text
input, we observe changes in scale and shift predictions. We provide the experiment results in Table 7.
From top to bottom, we provide text descriptions of scenes from small to large, and our model can
properly predict the corresponding scale and shift. This shows promise that our method is able to
manipulate the scale of 3D scenes with ease.

Discussion

Conclusion. We present the first study exploring whether language, as an additional input modality,
can resolve the scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation, an issue particularly relevant in the
context of the recent trend towards large-scale mixed dataset training. We propose a framework, RSA,
which learns to convert a scaleless (relative) depth map to metric depth using language descriptions
as input. RSA utilizes the pre-trained CLIP encoder, and maps a language description of the image to
scale and shift factors that transform the relative depth to metric depth. RSA is validated through
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and three pre-trained relative depth models,
demonstrating significant promise by drastically closing the gap between depth estimation accuracy
and its upper bound (that relies on ground truth), validating the hypothesis that language carries
valuable scale information that could be used to enhance depth estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate
that a unified model trained on both indoor and outdoor datasets with diverse scene compositions
generalizes across both scenarios, highlighting the robustness of language information in inferring
scale. Finally, a zero-shot transfer experiment shows that the minimal domain gap of language
description across scenes further generalizes to unseen data domains, without additional training. The
generalizability of RSA stems of our choice of modality, language, which is invariant to nuisance
variability that are present in images from lighting conditions and occlusions to specular reflectance
and object deformations. Our results demonstrate that RSA is a viable choice to support relative to
metric scale alignment for general-purpose monocular depth estimators.

Limitations and future work. We assume that the estimated 3D scene is up to an unknown scale.
Although a simple global scale has proven effective, it may not always be sufficiently expressive
for converting relative depth to absolute depth, especially when the relative depth is inaccurate. In
such cases, global scaling may not adequately recover a high-fidelity metric-scaled depth map due
to the presence of outliers. To address this, one may need to refine the relative depth outputted by
general-purpose monocular depth estimators. Future research may include extending RSA to handle
finer adjustments to also refine depth estimates and investigate the potential of inferring region-wise
or even pixel-wise scales using language input. Lastly, while language boasts high ease of use, RSA
is also vulnerable to malicious users who may choose captions to steer predictions incorrectly.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We claim in the abstract and introduction that we proposed a novel formulation
of the relative to metric depth transfer, and verify the feasibility of inferring scale from
language and as a general alignment module.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We create a separate section to discuss the potential limitations, including lack
of exploring human-generated descriptions, lack of certain factors in current descriptions,
and may not be expressive enough especially when the relative depth is inaccurate.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

16


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We don’t have theoretical result in this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided enough details about model architectures, datasets, depth
model setup, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters to reproduce all necessary experi-
ments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release our code and checkpoints, including training and evaluation scripts.
All datasets used in the paper are open-sourced.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided enough details about training and testing, including data
splits, hyperparameters, type of optimizer, ablation study, and analysis to understand the
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have stated sufficient information for computer resources in the hyperpa-
rameter section, including the type of compute worker, memory, and time of execution.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and will obey it.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discussed that our method could potentially enhance safety in autonomous
systems and benefit augmented reality and virtual reality, but might lead to potential job
losses in sectors like transportation.

Guidelines:

19


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: As a model for Monocular Depth Estimation, our model doesn’t have a high
risk for misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have properly cited all existing assets used in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

20


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release and document our code well.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper doesn’t involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper doesn’t involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

21


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
