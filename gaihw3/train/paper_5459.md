Abstract

Contemporary machine learning methods will try to approach the Bayes error, as
1

it is the lowest possible error any model can achieve. This paper postulates that
2

any decision is composed of not one but two Bayesian decisions and that decision-
3

making is, therefore, a double-Bayesian process. The paper shows how this duality
4

implies intrinsic uncertainty in decisions and how it incorporates explainability.
5

The proposed approach understands that Bayesian learning is tantamount to finding
6

a base for a logarithmic function measuring uncertainty, with solutions being fixed
7

points. Furthermore, following this approach, the golden ratio describes possible
8

solutions satisfying Bayes’ theorem. The double-Bayesian framework suggests
9

using a learning rate and momentum weight with values similar to those used in
10

the literature to train neural networks with stochastic gradient descent.

Introduction
12

Despite the progress in machine learning, several problems stand out for which convincing solutions
13

have yet to be found. With massive training sets, enormously sized networks, and immense computing
14

power, training machine learning models has become a brute force approach, arguably more concerned
15

with memorization than generalization. However, quoting from a post by Y. LeCun (Nov. 23, 2023),
16

we know that
17

Animals and humans get very smart very quickly with vastly smaller amounts of training data than
18

current AI systems. Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on text data that would take
19

20,000 years for a human to read. And still, they haven’t learned that if A is the same as B, then B
20

is the same as A. Humans get a lot smarter than that with comparatively little training data. Even
21

corvids, parrots, dogs, and octopuses get smarter than that very, very quickly, with only 2 billion
22

neurons and a few trillion "parameters."
23

This raises the question of whether modern training techniques and principles are actually biologically
24

implemented in the human brain and, if not, what alternative methods could save resources. More
25

efficient methods would be better at generalizing with smaller amounts of training data, which almost
26

certainly would also improve the explainability and interpretability of neural networks.
27

This paper investigates what it takes for a classifier to be optimal. The starting point is Bayes’ theorem,
28

which is the foundation of the Bayes classifier. The Bayes classifier is considered optimal because
29

it minimizes the Bayes risk, meaning it has the smallest probability of misclassification among all
30

classifiers. However, applying the Bayes classifier directly is often impossible because of the difficulty
31

in computing the posterior probabilities. For this reason, most classifiers are trying to approximate
32

the Bayes classifier, like the naïve Bayes classifier, for instance. The information-theoretical analysis
33

presented in this paper splits the decision of a Bayes classifier into two decisions, each following
34

Bayes’ theorem, where one decision can serve as an explanation or verification of the other. Each of
35

the two decision processes faces intrinsic uncertainty, as its decision depends on the output of the
36

other process. The paper will investigate the theoretical ramifications of this approach. As a practical

result, it will discuss the consequences for two hyperparameters of stochastic gradient descent used
38

in the training process of a neural network: learning rate and momentum weight.
39

The structure of the paper is as follows: After this introduction, Section 2 motivates one of the main
40

ideas, namely that learning to make a decision involves solving two sub-problems and, thus, two
41

decisions. Section 3 discusses Bayes’ theorem, which is central to statistical decision-making and
42

is the starting point of the theoretical approach outlined in the following. Section 4 then introduces
43

the double-Bayesian model as the key concept of the paper. The next section, Section 5, shows
44

how to represent possible solutions of the double-Bayesian decision model. Section 6 discusses the
45

golden ratio, including its functional equations and how it defines a solution to the double-Bayesian
46

model. Then, Section 7 discusses the theoretical implications for training double-Bayesian networks
47

with stochastic gradient descent. Finally, Section 8 summarizes the key concepts, followed by a
48

conclusion.

Dual decisions
50

Suppose a sender transmits the image on the left-hand side of Figure 1 to a receiver. This image

Figure 1: An image of Rubin’s vase (left) and its inverted counterpart (right) - (Rubin, 1915)

51

depicts Rubin’s vase by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin (Rubin, 1915), which shows a vase
52

or two faces looking at each other, depending on the receiver’s perception. The receiver then faces
53

an unsolvable conundrum: 1) If the receiver thinks the image represents a vase, the receiver cannot
54

be certain that the vase is indeed the intended message the sender wanted to convey. Maybe the
55

sender wanted to send the faces. 2) If the receiver is expecting a picture of a vase (or faces) and
56

thus knows the intended message, there is no certainty that an image of a vase has been transmitted.
57

After all, the image could show faces. Therefore, two decisions are involved in making the final
58

interpretation of the image: 1) a decision about the perception of the image (vase or faces), and 2)
59

a decision about whether the perceived image coincides with the intended message, meaning the
60

image transmitted. Both decisions together are fraught with intrinsic uncertainty because deciding the
61

ultimate interpretation of Rubin’s vase, a vase or faces, is impossible. Therefore, neither the sender
62

nor the receiver can make both decisions without uncertainty. Instead, the knowledge is distributed.
63

The sender knows the intended message (a vase or faces) but not the receiver’s perceived image. On
64

the other hand, the receiver knows the perceived image (a vase or faces) but not the intended message.
65

Therefore, the sender and the receiver must collaborate to get the true interpretation across their
66

communication channel.
67

Let the sender and receiver perceive Rubin’s vase differently, with contrary opinions about the
68

foreground and background color (black or white), where the foreground represents the perceived
69

image, either a vase or faces. Furthermore, let the sender and the receiver both be able to send
70

an image of Rubin’s vase to each other so that both become senders and receivers alike and can
71

share their knowledge about the perceived image and intended message. The image that the sender
72

perceives is then the inverted image that the sender perceives. The goal is to collaborate so that the
73

perceived image (foreground) equals the intended message on both ends.
74

A sender can either send the image of Rubin’s vase on the left-hand side of Figure 1 or send the
75

image with colors inverted, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 1, depending on the perceived
76

image or intended message, respectively. On the other end, the receiver has two options: 1) accept
77

the received image if it is identical to the image expected, or 2) tell the sender to invert the image if it
78

is different. After this feedback, the image on the receiver end will be the same as the image on the
79

2


---Page Break---
sender side. By making the images on both sides the same, the receiver has completed half of the
80

decision process without making a mistake and has thus behaved optimally. The receiver has ensured
81

that both sides see the same image. It is now up to the sender to make the final, second decision about
82

what image needs to be inverted to arrive at the final interpretation, either the image of the sender
83

or the image of the receiver. Thus, the first process tries to make the images identical, whereas the
84

second process tries to make the images different on both ends to reflect the different perceptions of
85

the sender and receiver.
86

Although described as a sequential process, the two dual decision processes leading to the final
87

interpretation are running in parallel. The sender is also a receiver, and the receiver is also a sender.
88

One of them conveys the correct foreground information (black or white), while the other conveys the
89

message. Note that neither the sender nor the receiver will ever see the true interpretation of the image.
90

The receiver in the example above will never know whether the received image needs to be inverted
91

after making the images identical because this would mean the receiver knows the true interpretation
92

of the image, which is not possible according to the uncertainty principle described above. A similar
93

statement can be made for the sender. The sender and the receiver can be considered dual and
94

complementary forces because of their different interpretations of foreground and background. They
95

make two binary decisions, deciding on the correct foreground color (black or white) and on the
96

message (a vase or faces). They decide whether Rubin’s vase should be interpreted as a white vase, a
97

black vase, white faces, or black faces.

Bayes theorem
99

Bayes’ theorem is a fundamental law in probability theory that describes the probability of an event
100

given prior knowledge. The theorem is of central importance in machine learning, where it guides the
101

training of machines for decision-making, such as in Bayesian inference or naïve Bayes classification.
102

For two events A and B, with prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), and P(B) ̸= 0, Bayes’ theorem
103

states the following:
104

P(A|B) = P(A) · P(B|A)

P(B)
,
(1)

where P(A|B) and P(B|A) are the conditional or posterior probabilities. Thus, P(A|B) is the
105

probability of event A occurring when B is true, and analogously, P(B|A) is the probability of B
106

given that A is true.
107

For a machine learning application, A would be the class of an observed input pattern B. The
108

probability P(A) is then the prior probability of class A, and P(B) is the prior probability of seeing
109

pattern B. Consequently, P(A|B) is the posterior probability of class A when seeing pattern B, and
110

P(B|A) is the posterior probability of B within A. According to Bayes’ theorem, three probabilities
111

are needed to compute the probability P(A|B) that class A is observed when seeing pattern B: P(A),
112

P(B), and P(B|A). However, several obstacles prevent Bayes’ theorem from being applied in this
113

way. No particular method can help determine the prior probabilities, which are often unknown.
114

Furthermore, the posterior probability is often not readily available and is approximated by making
115

assumptions about the distribution of B given A, for example, assuming a normal distribution.
116

To cope with these limitations, the next section describes decision-making as a dual process based on
117

Bayes’ theorem, with uncertainty intrinsically involved.
118

Double-Bayesian framework
119

The Bayes Theorem is typically stated as in Eq. 1. However, restating the theorem in the following
120

equivalent form highlights the two decision processes for the two subproblems involved, as motivated
121

in Section 2:
122

P(A|B)
P(B|A) = P(A)

P(B)
(2)

The left-hand side of Eq. 2 features a fraction of the posterior probabilities, whereas the right-hand
123

side shows the prior probabilities. Following the motivation in Section 2, the posterior probabilities,
124

P(A|B) and P(B|A), can be understood as the probability that A or B is the intended message,
125

respectively. Then, the prior probabilities, P(A) and P(B), would express the probabilities that A or
126

B is in the foreground.
127

3


---Page Break---
With only one equation for four parameters, Eq. 2 is underdetermined. However, it is fair to assume
128

that 1−(P(A|B) = P(B|A) and 1−P(A) = P(B), which leaves one equation with one parameter
129

on each side. This is possible because either A or B can be the message or foreground, not both of
130

them at the same time, following again the reasoning in Section 2. Therefore, the intrinsic uncertainty
131

in Bayes’ theorem can be described as follows: if the true foreground is known, then whether the
132

message needs to be swapped is unknown; on the other hand, if the message is known, then whether
133

the foreground needs to be swapped is unknown. The fractions on both sides of Eq. 2 are thus
134

"cognitively entangled."
135

The two remaining unknown parameters can be computed using two separate processes, each adding
136

a constraint to handle the uncertainty. To illustrate this, Eq. 3 restates Bayes’ theorem in yet another
137

way:
138

1 = P(A)

P(B) · P(B|A)

P(A|B)
(3)

Assuming that P(B) = P(B|A), Eq. 3 simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A). This assumption of B being
139

independent of A is fair because, according to the motivation in Section 2, the decisions about the
140

message and the foreground are independent of each other. Under this assumption, only one unknown
141

remains, either P(A|B) or P(A), which follows directly from either P(A) or P(A|B), depending
142

on which is input and which is output.
143

A similar, symmetric statement can be made when using the reciprocals on both sides of Eq. 2, which
144

leads to the following equation:
145

1 = P(B)

P(A) · P(A|B)

P(B|A)
(4)

Here, assuming that A is independent of B simplifies Eq. 4 to P(B|A) = P(B).
146

Solving Eq. 2, Eq. 3, or Eq. 4 will be referred to as solving the outer Bayes equation. On the other
147

hand, making both multiplicands on the right-hand side of Eq. 3 or Eq. 4 identical will be referred to
148

as solving the inner Bayes equation, or simply solving the inner equation of Eq. 3 or Eq. 4. For Eq. 3,
149

the inner Bayes equation thus states as follows:
150

P(A)
P(B) = P(B|A)

P(A|B)
(5)

Accordingly, the inner Bayes equation for Eq. 4 is obtained by using the reciprocals of the fractions
151

on both sides of Eq. 5:
152

P(B)
P(A) = P(A|B)

P(B|A)
(6)

Consequently, the inner Bayes equations can derived by inverting a fraction on one side of Bayes’
153

theorem, as stated in Eq. 2. The inner Bayes equations are thus "entangled" versions of Bayes’
154

theorem.
155

The two independent decision processes motivated above are solving the inner and outer Bayes equa-
156

tions. To further formalize these processes, the following section will add a logarithmic expression
157

to Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. Adding a logarithm offers several advantages: 1) using information theory to
158

measure uncertainty; 2) using a reciprocal becomes equivalent to changing the sign of a logarithm;
159

and 3) solving the equation in Bayes’ theorem is reduced to finding a suitable base for a logarithm.
160

5
Fixpoint solutions
161

Using a logarithmic expression in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 is possible when solutions become fixed points
162

of a logarithmic function. To illustrate this, let logb(x) be the logarithm for an input x and a base b.
163

By definition, the logarithm is the inverse function of taking the power. Therefore, the following
164

equation holds:
165

x = logb(bx)
(7)

For the base b of a logarithm, any positive real number can be used so long as b ̸= 1. A logarithm
166

computed for base b can be converted into a logarithm for base b′ as follows:
167

log′
b(x) = logb(x)/ logb(b′)
(8)

4


---Page Break---
Therefore, the simple term log is used for the logarithm in the following.
168

By applying the logarithm to probabilities, they become information. For the two dual processes
169

above, the information of one process will be its counterpart’s information with a different sign. To
170

achieve this, the following identity is required:
171

log(x) = x
(9)

The following lemma states that this requirement can be met for general input values.
172

Lemma: For every x ∈R+ \ {1}, there exists a base λ so that logλ(x) = x.
173

Proof: Let b ∈R+ \ {1} be an arbitrary basis for which logb(x) = y. Furthermore, let k be
174

a multiplier so that ky = x. Then, logλ(x) = x for λ = b1/k. This follows from Eq.8, with
175

logλ(x) = logb(x)/ logb(λ) = logb(x)/ logb(b1/k) = logb(x) · k = x.
176

Note that the common logarithmic rules apply for a fixed λ. However, when requiring a λ that always
177

satisfies logλ(x) = x, computations become ambiguous, as seen here: −logλ(x) = −x ̸= 1/x =
178

logλ(1/x). The base λ should be understood as a dynamic parameter that a learning system can
179

modify over time so that logλ(x) converges to the input x.
180

Using the logλ expression of the above Lemma, the Bayes’ equation in Eq. 3 can be written as
181

follows:
182

1 = P(A)

P(B) · logλ

 
P(B|A)
P(A|B)

!

(10)

Then, the following sequence of transformations can be derived from Eq. 10:
183

P(A|B)
=
P(A)
P(B) · logλ

 
P(B|A)

cos(ϕ)

,
(16)

where the last expression holds for an angle ϕ ∈

0 ; π

2

. The reasoning behind these transformations
184

is as follows:
185

The first step, Eq. 11, moves the posterior probability P(A|B) back to the left-hand side of the
186

equation. The result is Bayes’ theorem in its original form, as shown in Equation 1.
187

The next step, Eq. 12, replaces P(A) with 1 −P(B), removing one degree of freedom as motivated
188

above.
189

In the same way, Eq. 13 reformulates Eq. 12, assuming that P(B) = P(B|A) and that the two
190

multipliers on the right-hand side of the equation are equal to meet the inner Bayes equation.
191

Then, Eq. 14 rewrites the right-hand side of Eq. 13, transforming 1 −P(B) = P(B)2 into the
192

equivalent P(B) = 1 −P(B)2, which must hold true to satisfy the inner Bayes equation.
193

Finally, Eq. 15 extracts a factor of two from the logλ expression to get a radical input expression for
194

the logarithm, following the standard rules for logarithms. The new input term to the logλ expression
195

in Eq. 15 allows visualizing all possible solutions to the outer and inner Bayes equations.
196

To illustrate this further, Eq. 16 rewrites Eq. 15 using trigonometric functions and the Pythagorean
197

relationship between sin and cos: sin2 ϕ + cos2ϕ = 1, and thus sin ϕ = ±
p

1 −cos2ϕ and
198

cos ϕ = ±
p

1 −sin2ϕ. Solutions to the outer and inner Bayes equations then correspond to an
199

angle ϕ in Equation 16, depending on the base λ. Thus, solutions are points on the unit circle.
200

By changing the angle ϕ in Equation 16, all the possible solutions to the outer and inner Bayes
201

5


---Page Break---
equations can be visualized. Following the reasoning above, the right-hand side of Eq. 16 represents
202

the inner Bayes equation. Accordingly, after bringing the factor 2 on the other side of Eq. 16,
203

the inner Bayes equation is satisfied when sin(ϕ) = cos(ϕ), which is the case for ϕ = π/4, with
204

sin(π/4) = cos(π/4) = 1/
√

2.
205

For the dual process, the logλ expression can be used in combination with the other term of the inner
206

Bayes equation in Eq. 3, as shown here:
207

1 = logλ

 
P(A)
P(B)

!

· P(B|A)
P(A|B)
(17)

Note that the logλ expression has moved to the left compared to the right-hand side of Eq. 10. From
208

this equation, the following sequence of transformations can be derived similar to the transformations
209

above.
210

P(B)

(22)

2 · logλ
 
sin(ϕ)

· cos(ϕ)
(23)

During this sequence, assumptions similar to the ones in Eq. 12 and Eq. 13 are made. In Eq. 19,
211

P(B|A) was replaced by 1 −P(A|B), and Eq. 20 assumes that P(A) = P(A|B). Again, all
212

transformations assume that both multiplicands on the right-hand side are equal to satisfy the inner
213

Bayes equation.
214

The intrinsic uncertainty for the dual processes can again be seen in Eq. 16 and Eq. 23, where it
215

manifests like this: if the base λ is known, then the angle ϕ is unknown; and vice versa, if ϕ is known,
216

then λ is unknown. Each process contributes knowledge about λ and ϕ, which the other process does
217

not know.
218

The process knowledge about λ and ϕ does not need to be "all-or-nothing." The uncertainty ranges
219

continuously between two extremes, and both dual processes can be somewhat knowledgeable about
220

both parameters. When sin(ϕ) = cos(ϕ), with ϕ = π/4, one process has no or full knowledge
221

about one parameter. With ϕ approaching 0 or π/2, where sin(ϕ) and cos(ϕ) become different, this
222

knowledge increases or decreases, respectively.
223

6
Golden ratio
224

The solution to the inner Bayes equation is connected to the golden ratio (Livio, 2002), which becomes
225

evident from the transformations of equations above and the assumptions made for both processes.
226

Based on their right-hand equations, both dual processes must meet the same requirement to satisfy
227

the inner Bayes equation, assuming that logλ(x) produces x. For Eq. 12, with P(B) = P(B|A),
228

and for the corresponding Eq. 19 of the dual process, with P(A) = P(A|B), this requirement can be
229

written as
230

p = 1 −p

p

(24)

where the variable p is a placeholder for one of the probabilities. Eq. 24 holds true if p is the golden
231

ratio, which is defined by the equivalent quadratic equation,
232

p2 + p −1 = 0,
(25)

which has two irrational solutions p1 and p2:
233

p1 =

√

5 −1

2
≈0.618,
(26)

6


---Page Break---
and
234

p2 = −
√

5 −1

2
≈−1.618
(27)

A key observation is that the complement of both solutions, 1 −p, equals their square:
235

1 −p = p2
(28)

Alternatively, another quadratic equation that may be more frequently encountered in textbooks can
236

be used to arrive at the golden ratio. This equation is obtained by substituting −p for p in Eq. 25:
237

p2 −p −1 = 0
(29)

The alternative equation also possesses two irrational solutions, namely the negations of p1 and p2:
238

−p1 ≈−0.618
and −p2 ≈1.618
(30)

For these solutions, the complement 1 −p is the negative reciprocal:
239

1 −p = −1

p
(31)

Computing the complement of the golden ratio allows changing viewpoints and switching between
240

the solutions to the inner and outer Bayes equations. This will become important in the next section
241

for training neural networks.
242

The golden ratio is sometimes represented by the letter φ in the literature. It is often defined as a
243

single value, usually φ ≈1.618, and negative values are not considered (Livio, 2002; Huntley, 1970).
244

However, each of the four solutions to the aforementioned quadratic equations will be referred to as
245

the golden ratio in the context of this paper.

Theoretical implications
247

Supervised training methods first present a teaching input to a neural network and then try to make
248

the network’s output the same as the input by adjusting the network weights. This equalizing of
249

input and output can be related to equalizing multiplicands to satisfy the inner Bayes equation. For
250

example, in Eq. 18, the term P(B|A)/P(A|B) can be considered as input and the term P(A) in
251

the lambda expression as output. The task of the lambda expression is then to make both terms the
252

same to satisfy the inner Bayes equation. Moreover, the lambda expression logλ
 
P(A)

becomes
253

the gradient of a linear function for the outer Bayes equation. These relationships help to determine
254

the optimal learning rate and momentum weight for training based on backpropagation and stochastic
255

gradient descent (SGD).
256

A training method based on backpropagation estimates the gradient of a loss function with respect to
257

each network weight, where the loss function measures the difference between input and network
258

output. Backpropagation methods try to minimize the loss by following the gradient and updating the
259

network weights accordingly (LeCun et al., 2012). They accomplish this for one network layer at
260

a time, iteratively propagating the gradient back from the output layer to the input layer. To move
261

along the gradient towards the minimum of the loss function, a delta is added to each weight, which
262

often has the following form, including a momentum term:
263

∆wij(t) = −η
∂L
∂wij(t) + α · ∆wij(t −1)
(32)

In (32), L is the loss function, and ∆wij(t) denotes the delta added to each weight wij between a
264

node i and a node j in the network at training iteration (or time) t. The term ∂L/∂wij(t) is the partial
265

derivative of the loss function with respect to wij, at time t, which is multiplied with the learning
266

rate η. The sign of ∆wij(t) is negative, so the loss function approaches its minimum. In practice, a
267

momentum term describing the weight change at time t −1, ∆wij(t −1), is commonly added. This
268

term is typically multiplied by a weighting factor α, as seen in (32).
269

The traditional understanding is that the momentum term improves stochastic gradient descent by
270

dampening oscillations. However, the dual process model offers another explanation for the per-
271

formance improvement brought about by the momentum term. As of yet, a conclusive theory for
272

the optimal values of the learning rate η and the momentum weight α has been lacking. Although
273

7


---Page Break---
second-order methods (Bengio, 2012; Sutskever et al., 2013; Spall, 2000) as well as adaptive meth-
274

ods (Jacobs, 1988; Kingma and Ba, 2014; Duchi et al., 2011; Tieleman and Hinton, 2012) have been
275

tried with various degrees of success, an ultimate answer has still to be found. Both parameters are
276

usually determined heuristically through empirical experiments or systematic search (Bergstra and
277

Bengio, 2012). Training results can be very sensitive to the value of the learning rate. For example, a
278

small learning rate may result in slow convergence, whereas a larger learning rate may result in the
279

search passing over the minimum loss. Negotiating this delicate trade-off in the regularization of the
280

training process can be time-consuming in practical applications. The literature seems to prefer initial
281

learning rates around 0.01 or smaller for SGD, although reported values differ by several orders of
282

magnitude. For the momentum weight, higher initial values around 0.9 are more common (Li et al.,
283

2020; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016).
284

As shown in the following, the proposed dual process model allows deriving theoretical values for
285

both regularization parameters: learning rate η and momentum weight α. In the weight adjustment
286

given by Eq. 32, each summand represents a gradient of one of the two dual processes. These are
287

the partial derivative ∂L/∂wij(t) and the momentum term ∆wij(t −1). The momentum weight α
288

follows from the results above, where the lambda expression can be considered as the gradient of
289

the current iteration at time t. The other multiplicand of the inner Bayes equation corresponds to the
290

gradient of the other dual process at time t −1, assuming that both dual processes are interleaved, if
291

not in parallel.
292

The previous sections showed that the inner Bayes equation is met when both summands are equal to
293

sin(π/4) = cos(π/4) = 1/
√

2 and when they are equal to the golden ratio. Therefore, the delta at
294

t −1, ∆wij(t −1), needs to be multiplied by a constant to obtain the golden ratio. This constant is
295

the momentum weight α, which needs to satisfy α/
√

2 = p1, and can thus be computed as follows.
296

α =
√

2 · p1 ≈0.874,
(33)

where p1 is the value of the golden ratio in Eq. 26. So, this logic provides the value of the first
297

regularization term, namely the momentum weight α, with α ≈0.874.
298

The learning rate η can be derived from the momentum weight α by converting the latter to the
299

corresponding value for the dual process. The dual process does not aim to satisfy the inner Bayes
300

equation with ϕ = π/4. Instead, it aims to satisfy the outer Bayes equation, with ϕ = 0 or ϕ = π/2,
301

and thus sin(ϕ) = 0 and cos(ϕ) = 1, or sin(ϕ) = 1 and cos(ϕ) = 0. By moving in the opposite
302

direction of the gradient of its dual counterpart, the first process can minimize its loss in satisfying
303

the inner Bayes equation. Accordingly, taking the complement of the momentum weight α twice
304

results in the learning rate η for the gradient change at time t. Taking the complement of α twice can
305

be understood as looking at the same process from a dual point of view. Mathematically, this can be
306

achieved by squaring the simple complement, 1 −α. Squaring the complement follows the functional
307

equation of the golden ratio described by Eq.28. Squaring also means bringing the multiplier 2 back
308

in, which was extracted from the lambda expression in Eq. 15 and Eq. 22 to represent all solutions
309

graphically. Applying these steps to the momentum weight α then results in the following equation
310

for the learning rate η:
311

η = (1 −α)2 ≈0.016
(34)

So, this computation provides the value for the second regularization term, learning rate η, with η ≈
312

0.016.

Discussion
314

Starting from Bayes’ theorem, this paper develops a theoretical framework that describes any decision
315

of a machine classifier as the result of two processes. The first decision process determines the input
316

message; specifically, it decides whether the input is encoded according to its true value or needs to
317

be inverted. On the other hand, the second decision process decides whether the output should be
318

equal to the input or needs to be inverted. Although both decision processes run simultaneously, they
319

are independent processes, with each possessing knowledge not accessible to the other process. What
320

is uncertain for one process is certain for the other, and vice versa. The first process does not know
321

whether the input should be equal to the output, and conversely, the second process does not know
322

whether the input needs to be inverted. This means a binary decision always involves two bits, one
323

indicating the encoding of the input and the other defining the relationship between input and output.
324

8


---Page Break---
However, practically, only one of the two processes can be performed at a time, leaving one bit of
325

uncertainty for one of the processes.
326

Theoretically, the framework proposed here formulates this duality with two processes having
327

different perceptions of zero and one (black and white). The output of one process is the input to
328

the other process. While one process tries to make its output equal to its input, the other aims for
329

the opposite and tries to make its output as different as possible. The mathematical definitions of
330

these processes are defined by the outer and inner Bayes equation, the latter of which is an entangled
331

version of the original Bayes’ theorem. By introducing the logarithm, each process is given a control
332

parameter, namely the base of the logarithm, to achieve its goal. This parameter, which is essentially
333

a multiplier, allows each process to control the magnitude of the input/output.
334

The solution space of the proposed double-Bayesian decision framework can be visualized with the
335

trigonometric functions sin and cos. Furthermore, the golden ratio defines solutions to the inner
336

Bayes equation. Connecting these two observations leads to specific values for momentum weight
337

and learning rate for stochastic gradient descent, which tries to minimize the difference between
338

training input and output during training.
339

The supplemental material to this paper contains experiments for the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al.,
340

accessed May 21, 2024), where the proposed double-Bayesian learning framework is practically
341

evaluated. The theoretical parameters found in this paper did, in fact, provide the best performance
342

for a network trained with stochastic gradient descent in a large grid search for learning rate and
343

momentum weight.

Conclusion
345

Three primary characteristics define the work presented in this paper: First, a double-Bayesian
346

approach that understands learning as a process involving two Bayesian decisions instead of a single
347

decision, like in contemporary approaches. Second, solving a Bayesian decision problem is equivalent
348

to finding a fixed point for a logarithmic function measuring uncertainty. Third, the golden ratio
349

defines solutions to a Bayesian decision problem. These three characteristics make the proposed
350

approach novel and unique.
351

The double-Bayesian framework leads to new theoretical results for training neural networks, particu-
352

larly specific hyperparameter values for backpropagation and gradient descent. These results are in
353

contrast with other gradient descent heuristics in the literature that either use dynamic hyperparame-
354

ters or second-order methods for adjusting parameters during training. It will be interesting to see how
355

this conceptual difference will be resolved in the future. The proposed framework offers new ways to
356

understand how neural networks make decisions and may thus contribute to the interpretability and
357

explainability of neural networks, an actively investigated research area.
358

The proposed framework may also help build bridges to other disciplines like neuroscience or
359

physics. For example, representing all possible solutions to a double-Bayesian decision by means
360

of trigonometric functions, as done in this paper, introduces waves. Incorporating brain waves into
361

machine learning, a feature that traditional machine learning approaches are arguably lacking, would
362

likely entail a better understanding of learning in general. This better understanding could mean
363

training methods for smaller networks that could achieve the same performance with less training
364

data, as motivated at the beginning of this paper.
365

Another example of a discipline that could be related to this work is quantum mechanics. One of the
366

fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which states that
367

certain pairs of physical properties, such as the position and momentum of an electron, cannot be
368

measured with absolute certainty. The more accurately one property is measured, the less is known
369

about the other property. The proposed double-Bayesian framework incorporates such an intrinsic
370

uncertainty and makes a connection to Bayesian decision theory, which could lead to new insights.
371

Although empirical evidence in the literature supports the theoretical hyperparameter values derived
372

in this paper, and the experiments in the supplemental material show that these values outperform
373

other value pairs, more practical experiments are needed to corroborate these values. To address this
374

limitation, future work will validate the practicality of the derived hyperparameter values in additional
375

experiments across different domains and compare their performance with the performance of other
376

values and other optimization strategies.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
422

1. Claims
423

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
424

paper’s contributions and scope?
425

Answer: [Yes]
426

Justification: This is a theoretical paper that tries to explain hyperparameter values that
427

have been successfully used in the literature. The paper investigates what it takes for a
428

classifier to be optimal, as stated in the introduction. Although the literature and the
429

practical experiments provided in the supplemental material support the theoretical
430

results, providing more practical experiments would be desirable.
431

Guidelines:
432

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
433

made in the paper.
434

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
435

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
436

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
437

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
438

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
439

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
440

are not attained by the paper.
441

2. Limitations
442

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
443

Answer: [Yes]
444

Justification: The limitations are discussed at the very end of the paper in the con-
445

clusion. A comparison with other hyperparameter optimization strategies would be
446

desirable to corroborate the theoretical results even more. Specifically, a systematic
447

comparison with second-order methods and other methods that dynamically adapt
448

hyperparameters during training should shed more light on the performance of this
449

approach.
450

Guidelines:
451

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
452

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
453

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
454

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
455

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
456

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
457

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
458

implications would be.
459

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
460

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
461

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
462

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
463

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
464

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
465

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
466

technical jargon.
467

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
468

and how they scale with dataset size.
469

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
470

address problems of privacy and fairness.
471

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
472

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
473

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
474

11


---Page Break---
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
475

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
476

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
477

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
478

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
479

a complete (and correct) proof?
480

Answer: [Yes]
481

Justification: All assumptions are discussed in detail, and one proof has been included.
482

Guidelines:
483

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
484

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
485

referenced.
486

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
487

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
488

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
489

proof sketch to provide intuition.
490

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
491

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
492

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
493

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
494

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
495

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
496

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
497

Answer: [Yes]
498

Justification: Experimental results are listed in the supplemental material, with infor-
499

mation to reproduce the results, including the code itself.
500

Guidelines:
501

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
502

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
503

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
504

whether the code and data are provided or not.
505

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
506

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
507

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
508

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
509

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
510

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
511

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
512

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
513

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
514

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
515

appropriate to the research performed.
516

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
517

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
518

nature of the contribution. For example
519

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
520

to reproduce that algorithm.
521

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
522

the architecture clearly and fully.
523

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
524

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
525

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
526

the dataset).
527

12


---Page Break---
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
528

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
529

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
530

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
531

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
532

5. Open access to data and code
533

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
534

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
535

material?
536

Answer: [Yes]
537

Justification: Please see the supplemental material for the code and information about
538

reproducing the experimental results. The publicly available MNIST database has
539

been used for the experiments.
540

Guidelines:
541

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
542

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
543

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
544

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
545

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
546

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
547

benchmark).
548

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
549

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
550

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
551

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
552

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
553

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
554

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
555

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
556

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
557

versions (if applicable).
558

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
559

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
560

6. Experimental Setting/Details
561

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
562

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
563

results?
564

Answer: [Yes]
565

Justification: Please see the information in the supplemental material.
566

Guidelines:
567

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
568

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
569

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
570

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
571

material.
572

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
573

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
574

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
575

Answer: [NA]
576

Justification: The paper provides theoretical results. For the experimental results in
577

the supplemental material, only the relative performance to other hyperparameter
578

combinations was investigated, significant or not, to see whether the proposed values
579

13


---Page Break---
define the optimum or are at least close to it. To compare the proposed method and
580

values with other optimization methods, future experiments may require significance
581

tests.
582

Guidelines:
583

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
584

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
585

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
586

the main claims of the paper.
587

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
588

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
589

run with given experimental conditions).
590

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
591

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
592

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
593

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
594

of the mean.
595

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
596

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
597

of Normality of errors is not verified.
598

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
599

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
600

error rates).
601

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
602

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
603

8. Experiments Compute Resources
604

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
605

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
606

the experiments?
607

Answer: [Yes]
608

Justification: Please see the supplemental material for more information.
609

Guidelines:
610

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
611

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
612

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
613

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
614

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
615

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
616

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
617

didn’t make it into the paper).
618

9. Code Of Ethics
619

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
620

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
621

Answer: [Yes]
622

Justification: There is no violation of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
623

Guidelines:
624

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
625

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
626

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
627

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
628

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
629

10. Broader Impacts
630

14


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
631

societal impacts of the work performed?
632

Answer: [NA]
633

Justification: The paper proposes a generic method to find hyperparameter values
634

for optimizing the performance of neural networks. Its societal impacts, therefore,
635

correlate with the risks of machine learning in general, which does not need to be
636

pointed out in particular according to the guidelines below.
637

Guidelines:
638

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
639

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
640

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
641

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
642

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
643

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
644

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
645

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
646

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
647

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
648

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
649

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
650

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
651

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
652

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
653

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
654

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
655

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
656

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
657

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
658

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
659

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
660

11. Safeguards
661

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
662

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
663

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
664

Answer: [NA]
665

Justification: There is no risk of misusing the proposed method beyond misusing
666

machine learning in general.
667

Guidelines:
668

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
669

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
670

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
671

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
672

safety filters.
673

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
674

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
675

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
676

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
677

faith effort.
678

12. Licenses for existing assets
679

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
680

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
681

properly respected?
682

Answer: [Yes]
683

15


---Page Break---
Justification: The main paper cites relevant references for the scientific content and the
684

supplemental material provides more details about the data and software sources.
685

Guidelines:
686

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
687

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
688

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
689

URL.
690

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
691

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
692

service of that source should be provided.
693

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
694

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
695

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
696

license of a dataset.
697

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
698

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
699

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
700

the asset’s creators.
701

13. New Assets
702

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
703

provided alongside the assets?
704

Answer: [Yes]
705

Justification: The paper provides new assets in the form of knowledge about hyperpa-
706

rameter values to train neural networks with gradient descent and software to find
707

the best combination of momentum weight and learning rate with a grid search. Each
708

asset is documented in the paper and supplemental material, respectively.
709

Guidelines:
710

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
711

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
712

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
713

limitations, etc.
714

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
715

asset is used.
716

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
717

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
718

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
719

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
720

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
721

well as details about compensation (if any)?
722

Answer: [NA]
723

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
724

subjects.
725

Guidelines:
726

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
727

human subjects.
728

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
729

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
730

included in the main paper.
731

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
732

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
733

collector.
734

16


---Page Break---
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
735

Subjects
736

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
737

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
738

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
739

institution) were obtained?
740

Answer: [NA]
741

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
742

subjects.
743

Guidelines:
744

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
745

human subjects.
746

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
747

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
748

should clearly state this in the paper.
749

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
750

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
751

guidelines for their institution.
752

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
753

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
754

A
Appendix / supplemental material
755

Two grid searches for the publicly available MNIST dataset were performed to corroborate the
756

learning rate and momentum weight derived in the main paper (LeCun et al., accessed May 21, 2024).
757

The MNIST dataset contains gray-scale images of handwritten digits and is one of the prominent
758

datasets used to evaluate machine learning methods. It is split into a training and a test set, where the
759

latter serves as a standard of comparison. Figure 2 shows an example of the MNIST data.

Figure 2: A slightly enlarged example from the MNIST dataset showing a handwritten digit (4).

760

A.1
Experiments
761

The grid searches were performed on the full-size MNIST dataset and a smaller version of MNIST
762

containing only 50% of the training data. In the latter case, a stratified sampling method named
763

StratifiedShuffleSplit was used to create a stratified random subset of the training samples (Scikit-
764

learn developers , BSD License; Pedregosa et al., 2011; Buitinck et al., 2013). This ensured that the
765

class distribution in the training subset was the same as in the original full-size training set. The
766

degradation in dataset size allowed observing how each optimizer performed under varying amounts
767

of training data, assuming that providing less training data posed a harder problem.
768

A deep learning model was trained based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model
769

consisted of two convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation function and a max
770

pooling operation. The first convolutional layer had a single-channel input (grayscale image) and
771

applied 16 filters, followed by a second convolutional layer that expanded the channel size to 32.
772

Both convolutional layers used a 3x3 kernel size, a stride of one, and a padding of one. After each
773

convolution, a ReLU activation function introduced non-linearity, and a max pooling operation with
774

17


---Page Break---
a 2x2 kernel and stride reduced the spatial dimensions by half. A dropout layer with a rate of 0.25
775

was applied after flattening the output to prevent overfitting. The network concluded with two fully
776

connected layers with a final output of 10 classes, where the maximum output value determined the
777

class of an input image. The number of parameters was around two hundred thousand for an MNIST
778

input image of size 28x28. A weight initialization was performed using the Kaiming uniform method.
779

No data augmentation techniques were applied; however, the input was normalized to the range [-1,1].
780

The training used a batch size of 64 and was conducted over 30 epochs, employing cross entropy
781

as the loss function. The sizes of the training, validation, and test datasets were 54,000, 6,000, and
782

10,000, respectively. Finally, the model’s performance was assessed through 10-fold cross-validation.
783

A.2
Results
784

The results of both grid searches are shown in Figure 3 for the full-size training set and in Figure 3
785

for the smaller training set with 50% of the size. The following values were used as momentum

Figure 3: Grid search results for MNIST

786

weights for each grid search: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.825, 0.85, 0.874, 0.9, and 0.925. On the other
787

hand, the following values were used as learning rates: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.016, 0.1, 0.2. These
788

values included the momentum weight derived in the paper (α ≈0.874) and the derived learning
789

rate (η ≈0.016). Other values were chosen based on their use in the literature or to increase the
790

resolution around the derived theoretical values. All possible combinations of values span a 6x10
791

grid. The color of each square in the grids of Figure 3 and Figure 4 represent the performance of the
792

corresponding pair of momentum weight and learning rate, with lighter colors representing higher
793

performance. Green rectangles indicate the top ten performing pairs, whereas blue rectangles show
794

the best-performing pair. Note that more than one pair can share the best performance, as in Figure 3.
795

Figure 3 shows that no pair of momentum weight and learning rate provides better performance on
796

the full-size MNIST set than the pair derived in the paper, (0.016, 0.874), although this pair has to
797

share its first place with other pairs. The classification accuracies for the reduced training set size
798

are slightly lower in the table of Figure 4, as one would expect for a problem with less training data.
799

18


---Page Break---
Nevertheless, the theoretical values derived in the paper for momentum weight and learning rate show

Figure 4: Grid search results for MNIST using only 50% of the training data

800

again the best performance.
801

A.3
Computational environment and runtime
802

The software was developed using Python 3.10, and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
803

was implemented in Pytorch 2.2.2. For each combination of learning rate and momentum weight (60
804

combinations in total), the training time was approximately three hours for 100% of the training set
805

size and about 1.5 hours for 50% of the training set. Consequently, the cumulative GPU time for all
806

experiments was approximately (3 + 1.5) × 60 hours, which is 270 hours. The average memory usage
807

was roughly 1 GB for each combination. For more information about the software requirements and
808

workflow, see the Readme file uploaded as supplemental material together with the code.
809

A.4
Computing cluster
810

Figure 5 shows an overview of the GPU computing cluster that was available for the experiments,
