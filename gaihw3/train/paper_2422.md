Abstract

Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have recently achieved promi-
nent improvements. However, these works mainly focus on confined categories
or synthetic 3D assets, which are discouraged from generalizing to challenging
in-the-wild scenes and fail to be employed with 2D synthesis directly. Moreover,
these methods heavily depended on camera poses, limiting their real-world ap-
plications. To overcome these issues, we propose MVInpainter, re-formulating
the 3D editing as a multi-view 2D inpainting task. Specifically, MVInpainter
partially inpaints multi-view images with the reference guidance rather than in-
tractably generating an entirely novel view from scratch, which largely simplifies
the difficulty of in-the-wild NVS and leverages unmasked clues instead of explicit
pose conditions. To ensure cross-view consistency, MVInpainter is enhanced by
video priors from motion components and appearance guidance from concate-
nated reference key&value attention. Furthermore, MVInpainter incorporates slot
attention to aggregate high-level optical flow features from unmasked regions
to control the camera movement with pose-free training and inference. Suffi-
cient scene-level experiments on both object-centric and forward-facing datasets
verify the effectiveness of MVInpainter, including diverse tasks, such as multi-
view object removal, synthesis, insertion, and replacement. The project page is

Introduction

This paper studies editing 3D scenes by expanding one or few 2D manipulated references to other
observed views. Particularly, with the development of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) mod-
els [59, 63, 4, 54], we have seen substantial success in novel view synthesis (NVS) [23, 30, 97], 3D
generation [55, 40, 79, 96, 44, 67, 43, 66], and controllable generation [60, 98, 10, 14]. But most
existing synthesis methods [14, 98, 10] have only been proven useful in 2D scenarios. It is intuitive
to extend these pioneering methods to multi-view scenarios to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D
editing. This raises the question: how to make a unified framework to generate vivid multi-view
foreground objects seamlessly integrated with their surroundings?

Despite the achievements in NVS and 3D generation, achieving multi-view consistent scene editing
by inserting, removing, replacing objects like Fig. 1 still present challenges. 1) 3D object generation
struggles to generalize to scene-level editing. Most object-centric 3D generation methods [44, 67, 31]
are trained on large-scale synthetic datasets [18, 17, 31] with simplistic backgrounds, neglecting
real-world factors like illumination and shadows, which are essential for natural editing. While some
methods integrate predefined 3D assets into NeRFs [65] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [15], they
still struggle with blending foreground and background elements seamlessly. 2) NVS methods have

removal, and (c) object insertion and replacement through multi-view consistent inpainting ability.
Given one inpainted or edited reference image, MVInpainter spreads it to other masked views without

difficulty generalizing across various categories. Even when enhanced by diffusion models, existing
NVS-based methods [12, 73, 29, 1] only work in specific scenarios and often fail to generalize to di-
verse or unseen categories in scene data. 3) Instance-level 3D editing is time-consuming. Approaches
like instance-level 3D editing [26, 68, 3] and warp-and-inpaint NVS [23, 30, 97] integrate priors from
single-view T2I models [59], requiring costly dataset updates to address multi-view inconsistency.
4) Heavy reliance on explicit camera poses. All methods mentioned rely on accurate camera poses
for both training and inference, limiting scalability with pose-free data and broader applicability,
particularly in scenarios like short video editing where detailed poses may be unavailable.

To this end, we present a novel perspective to enable 3D editing with a multi-view consistent inpainting
manner. By starting with an edited 2D reference image from any 2D generative models [98, 14] and
applying our method to masked sequences from other viewpoints, we achieve consistent multi-view
inpainting results, effectively extending 2D generation into 3D scenarios. The key idea behind this
inpainting approach is to focus on seamlessly synthesizing local regions rather than generating entirely
new views. Many contextual cues like illumination, shadow, and camera motions are implicitly
captured in unmasked regions, which can be activated by foundational T2I models. Thus, our method
provides an end-to-end multi-view synthesis solution without requiring test-time optimization or
explicit pose conditions, opening up possibilities for both 2D and 3D editing.

Formally, this paper introduces MVInpainter, a multi-view consistent inpainting model built upon
a pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD) inpainting model [59]. We incorporate domain adapters and
motion modules [25] to MVInpainter as video priors for multi-view consistent structures. Moreover,
to encourage appearance consistency, we propose the Reference Key&Value concatenation (Ref-
KV), spatially concatenating the key and value features from the reference view to target ones in
self-attention modules. Furthermore, MVInpainter operates without explicit poses, utilizing slot-
attention mechanisms [45, 87] of encoding and grouping motion priors from unmasked surroundings’
optical flow for implicitly pose control. We train two MVInpainters sharing the same pre-trained
SD backbone in object-centric (CO3D [57], MVImgNet [95]) and forward-facing (Scannet++ [89],
Real10k [103], DL3DV [41]) scenes, respectively. Experiments on unseen scenes and zero-shot
datasets as Omni3D [6] and SPInNeRF [51] show the efficacy of MVInpainter in various applications,
such as multi-view object removal, synthesis, insertion, and replacement.

In summary, 1) we present MVInpainter as the first multi-view consistent inpainting model to bridge
2D and 3D scene editing. 2) MVInpainter is a pose-free end-to-end approach with high-level flow-
based motion control from unmasked regions. 3) MVInpainter largely simplifies the NVS difficulty,
which can be generalized to all categories of in-the-wild CO3D, MVImgNet, and Omni3D datasets,
as well as complicated forward-facing scenes of Scannet++, Real10k, DL3DV, and SPInNeRF.

learning-based methods [83]. Compared to the low-level feature-based traditional manners [61, 36],
learning-based ones gradually dominate this field and achieved substantial successes based on
GANs [53, 100, 37, 8], attention mechanism [93, 90], adapted convolutions [42, 94, 70], and diffusion
models [47, 62, 59]. Moreover, the image inpainting task can be further extended to reference-guided
inpainting and video inpainting. Reference-guided inpainting completes the target image based on
one or several reference images, which incorporates 3D information for accurate structures [105, 101]
or T2I priors for examplar-based recovery and editing [86, 14, 7]. On the other hand, video inpainting
methods [24, 39, 102] often include the optical flow to capture motions for superior spatial and
temporal coherence. However, we should clarify that the aforementioned inpainting methods cannot
achieve multi-view consistent inpainting for 3D scene editing. The reference-based manners lack
multi-view consistency across all generated views, while video-based methods focus on moving
foregrounds rather than the synthesis with large viewpoint changes as verified in our experiments.

3D Generation. Given text descriptions or reference images, 3D generative models produce high-
quality 3D assets, which have been widely investigated recently, benefiting from the rapid devel-
opment of diffusion-based 2D T2I models [59, 63, 4, 54, 21]. Some pioneering works with score
distillation sampling (SDS) loss [75, 55] leverage priors from diffusion-based 2D supervision for the
3D generation, which is further explored to better optimization objectives [106, 79] and multi-stage
learning [40, 13, 71]. On the other hand, Zero123 [44] fine-tuned the T2I model for object-level NVS,
which is further investigated for consistent multi-view synthesis [67, 66, 43, 46]. Besides, enhanced
by the good 3D feature presentations, like tri-plane [11], and scalable network backbones [74], foun-
dational 3D generation models also achieved impressive results [109, 85, 31], training with extremely
large 3D datasets from scratch. However, all these works are trained with large-scale synthetic 3D
objects or optimized through SDS without any interaction with complicated backgrounds, making it
difficult to generalize to real-world editing scenarios with reasonable illustrations and shadows.

Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Before the diffusion models, most NVS works focused on learning
promising feature encoder [69, 91] with blur regression-based predictions. After the development of
3D-aware diffusion models [12, 73, 1] and fine-tuning from foundational T2I models [64, 29, 82],
NVS results are significantly improved. However, generating whole novel views is too challenging.
Thus these methods still suffer from constrained generalization with seen categories or expensive
test-time optimization. Another way is to iteratively warp and inpaint the novel views through
monocular depth estimation and 2D inpainting [92, 23, 30, 97]. Despite impressive scene-level
synthesis results, these methods suffer from prohibitive time costs for the warp-and-inpaint dataset
update. Moreover, ambiguous depth estimations would degrade the structures of foreground objects.

NeRF and 3DGS Editing. With the development of NeRF [49] and 3DGS [35], many follow-ups
tried to integrate them into 2D generative models, including NeRF inpainting [51, 81, 50], textual-
guided semantic editing [26, 15] and local editing [108, 3, 38] based on SDS loss. InseRF [65] unifies
both NeRF editing and 3D generation by inserting an image-to-3D generation into multi-view images
for the NeRF optimization. Unfortunately, local editing-based approaches suffer from unnatural and
disharmonious results, especially for the illumination and shadow in boundary regions. Furthermore,
all these works require scenes with accurate camera poses and costly test-time optimization to
encourage multi-view consistency, limiting their real-world applications.

Approach

Overview. We show the overall pipeline and contributions in Fig. 2, which is detailed in Fig. 3(a). The
inputs of MVInpainter are sequential images I0:N of the same scene and related masks M0:N with
N + 1 total views; I0 indicates the clean reference image manipulated by any 2D editing approach,
while I1:N are other target views needed to be inpainted by MVInpainter with consistent results.

Multi-View Inpainting Formulation. We focus on multi-view inpainting rather than naive NVS
as it suits real-world editing better, because 1) most real-world edits do not need to synthesize
complete novel views; 2) the inpainting formulation activates the inherent in-context priors from
T2I models to ensure natural illumination and shadow, which are intractable to be addressed by
3D generation trained with synthetic data; 3) such a simplified formulation alleviates the training
difficulty and the dependency on camera poses. Specifically, MVInpainter enjoys consistent multi-
view inpainting to bridge 2D and 3D editing, which is built upon a foundation 2D inpainting model,
SD1.5-inpainting [59] with two data prerequisites. First, the input multi-view images I0:N should

data, while MVInpainter-F is trained on forward-facing data with a shared SD-inpainting backbone
of different LoRA/motion weights and masking strategies. The object-centric MVInpainter focuses
on the object-level NVS, while the forward-facing one is devoted to object removal and scene-level
inpainting. (b) The Ref-KV is used in spatial self-attention blocks of denoising U-Net. (c) The

be captured in an ordered camera trajectory to alleviate the pose requirement. Second, M0 is a zero
matrix to ensure the first view is clean without masking, while other masks M1:N should cover all
possible regions in respective views where the target object would be placed at. To elegantly meet
this demand, we propose a heuristic masking technique for the inference detailed in Sec. 3.4. Hence,
the input of MVInpainter could be formulated as an ordered video sequence with (N + 1) frames as:

xt = [z0:N
t
; z(1 −ˆM)0:N; ˆM0:N] ∈R(N+1)×H×W ×9,

where t indicates the timestep in the diffusion; z0:N

I0:N after the VAE encoding [59]; ˆM0:N and z(1 −ˆM)0:N mean that the downsampled masks and
noise-free latent features in unmasked regions are always concatenated as the input condition. We
learn MVInpainter through the epsilon prediction ϵθ [28], while the MSE loss can be written as:

where c denotes the prompt text encoded by the textual CLIP τφ [56].

3.1
MVInpainter Tasks

Here we tackle two related but distinct tasks: multi-view consistent object removal, and object
insertion or replacement. Due to the differing challenges of each task, we employ the same structure,
called MVInpainter, but trained with different multi-view data, prompts, and masking strategies,
leading to two variants: MVInpainter-O and MVInpainter-F.

Object-Centric and Forward-Facing Datasets. Particularly, we train these two MVInpainters to
handle different distributions of multi-view data: object-centric and forward-facing data. Object-

4


---Page Break---
centric datasets (CO3D [57], MVImgNet [95], Omni3D [6])2 feature a single object at the center of
all views, captured with the camera circling around it. On the other hand, forward-facing datasets
(Real10K [103], Scannet++ [89], DL3DV [41]) resemble static video data with camera movements
but no specific foreground objects. Essentially, object-centric images heavily favor a single foreground
object in all views, so an MVInpainter trained on them struggles to reliably remove objects without
hallucinating any artifacts. Conversely, forward-facing images are not conducive to modeling multi-
view object synthesis with significant viewpoint changes.

To address these challenges, we separately train MVInpainter-O and MVInpainter-F on object-centric
and forward-facing datasets, respectively. They involve different LoRAs, motion modules (Sec. 3.2),
and flow grouping modules (Sec. 3.3). Note that we keep the SD-inpainting backbone frozen for
both models. While fine-tuning the entire SD backbone for MVInpainter-O might help convergence
with mixed CO3D and MVImgNet datasets, we maintain consistent settings with MVInpainter-F for
simplified discussion in this study. Please refer to Sec. B.5 of Appendix for more details.

Prompt. For MVInpainter-O, we empirically find that meaningful prompts c benefit to preserve
the identity and appearance of objects, as these prompts provide complementary information for
the object synthesis with unseen viewpoints. Thus we utilize InternLM [19] to extract captions
for training and inference. For MVInpainter-F which is mainly used for object removal and scene
completion with minor viewpoint changing, we leverage the prompt tuning technique [7] with 16
trainable tokens as the global prompts instead of specific descriptions for stable generation.

Masking Strategy. We adopt hybrid inpainting masks [70, 8] for MVInpainter, including random
irregular, rectangular, and segmentation-based masks. In particular, we further employ the object-
level tracking masks for MVInpainter-O training, which could be easily accomplished by SAM-
tracking [88]. Moreover, to avoid the mask overfitting towards the object shape, we follow [7] to
randomly disturb the object masks with rectangular and irregular masks. Note that MVInpainter-O
preserves a little percentage (15%) to use random masks without the object ones to encourage the
cross-view learning ability for the frame interpolation and sparse-view NVS (Appendix Sec. B.2).

3.2
Multi-View Consistent Inpainting Model

Motion Priors from Video Models. Since the input of MVInpainter could be regarded as the
video sequence as in Eq. 1, it is intuitive to leverage motion priors from video models to improve
performance. Thus we employ the domain adapted LoRA [32] and temporal transformers from
AnimateDiff [25] pre-trained on video data as the initialized motion parts of MVInpainter. Although
AnimateDiff is not trained for an inpainting model, we surprisingly find that it could be well converged
with only a few hundred steps of fine-tuning, while both MVInpainter and AnimateDiff share the
same SD1.5 backbone. Empowered by motion priors, MVInpainter achieves significantly superior
structural consistency as discussed in Sec. 4.4.

Reference Key&Value Concatenation (Ref-KV). Inspired by [66, 33], to further ensure appearance
consistency, we adopted Ref-KV in the self-attention of denoising U-Net to activate the inherent
capacity of T2I models. Ref-KV spatially concatenates reference features to target keys and values to
inject appearance guidance during attention aggregation as in Fig. 3(b). We clarify the originality
of Ref-KV as follows. Compared to aggregating all frames [29], Ref-KV only focuses on the first
reference view, which reduces memory and computational costs, and also substantially enhances
the appearance consistency as verified in Fig. 7. Different from the reference attention in [66, 33],
MVInpainter is an inpainting model, which always captures the unmasked reference latent without
noise (Eq. 1), thus it is unnecessary to re-scale the latent by multiplying a large scale [66] or use the
noise-free latent from another U-Net [33].

3.3
Pose-Free Flow Grouping

Benefiting from the inpainting formulation and the ordered input sequence of MVInpainter, our
approach could be trained and tested without explicit camera poses. However, it is still non-trivial
to inpaint the foreground object with correct poses while the masks are large or the unmasked
environment is ambiguous and textureless. To overcome this, we leverage the low-level optical flows

2This paper only focuses on data captured by object-centric camera trajectory rather than discovering
decoupled observations through unsupervised feature learning [45, 104, 34].

extracted by RAFT [72] to guide the MVInpainter generation. We regard the reverse N-frame optical
flow as F0:N−1 ∈R(N−1)×H×W ×2. All flow inputs are masked to avoid leakage3.

In the pilot study, we first applied the 2D CNN and self-attention modules to encode the flow features
and added them to the U-Net input as additional conditions. But such simple incorporation failed
to improve the MVInpainter as the ‘dense flow’ setting in Tab. 3b. Because such an explicit dense
flow injection leads to the overfitting pitfall, i.e., MVInpainter is strongly controlled by the flow
inputs and ignores other contextual clues learned from the foundational T2I model. We hope the flow
feature should carry more high-level motion characters, such as the direction and speed of the camera
trajectory rather than the detailed correlation. Thus we propose the flow grouping enhanced by the
slot-attention [45, 87] as shown in Fig. 3(c).

Formally, slot-attention maintains K learnable query vectors as Q ∈RK×d, where d denotes the
channels; K = 4 in this paper. Key and value are the same flow features as K = V ∈RHW ×d. Then
the slot-attention can be formulated as:

Slot-Attn(Q, K, V) = softmaxq(
˜Q ˜KT

√

d
) ˜V ∈RK×d,
(3)

where ˜Q, ˜K, ˜V indicate QWq, KWk, VWv encoded by linear weights Wq, Wk, Wv ∈Rd×d. Note
that the slot-attention is similar to the cross-attention except that the former should be normalized
in the query dimension, while the latter is normalized in the key dimension. As the global queries,
all slot features Q enjoy the high-level motion information aggregated by dense flow features. We
take these slot features and subsequently use an FC layer to encode them into a single flow grouping
embedding as shown in Fig. 3(c). According to the ablation study in Tab. 3b, we concatenate this
embedding to the CLIP feature as an extra motion ‘token’ with comparable performance and less
trainable weights. Moreover, we found that using temporal 3D attention for the flow grouping can
further improve the results, while the slot features are shared across all views with more general
information. Flow grouping achieves more robust guidance for MVInpainter than the dense flow
features, even with some corrupted or inaccurate flow inputs.

3.4
Inference

We show the inference pipeline of MVInpainter in Fig. 4(a). Specifically, given sequential images,
MVInpainter could address the general multi-view editing through object removal and object insertion
mentioned in Sec. 3.1. The object removal stage can be omitted if there are no foreground objects
(inserting only) or the target object shares similar masks as the original one (replacing). For the object
removal, we utilize the MVInpainter-F based on the reference image inpainted by SD-inpainting with
the caption “background”. For the object insertion, the reference image can be achieved by any 2D

3We extract flows before masking, because foregrounds largely benefit the flow quality. We further dilate
masks with 5 pixels for flow to avoid leakage. As low-level local features, no conflict is observed when using
these masked flows for applications like removal and replacement.

generative models, such as T2I inpainting [59, 77, 84] and exemplar-based inpainting [86, 14]. Then
MVInpainter-O is leveraged to expand the single-view generation to the multi-view scenario. We
propose a heuristic masking adaption to tackle the most critical issue, i.e., building suitable masks
without any pose conditions before the insertion.

Masking Adaption is based on points from the closed convex hull as shown in Fig. 4(b), which can
be obtained from the 3D bounding box of the foreground object. We could use open-vocabulary 3D
grounding [16] or manually annotate four landmarks to achieve the bottom face and estimate the
top face through the height of the 2D mask. To reasonably warp the 3D box, our masking adaption
should meet an important and easily satisfied condition: the 3D box’s bottom face and the basic plane
on which the object is placed must be the same plane. Intuitively, the bottom face should be close
to the ground. Therefore, the basic plane and the bottom face of the 3D box from different image
pairs share the same perspective transformation matrix. Thanks to the dense matching [20], it is easy
to obtain dense matching pairs on the basic plane through the Grounded-SAM [58] as in Fig. 4(c).
Subsequently, we achieve the transformation matrix M by RANSAC [22] with 100 sampled matching
pairs and apply the perspective warping for the new bottom face. Note that this perspective warping
cannot be used on the top face, because the top face is just parallel to the basic plane rather than
close to it. Instead, we get the new top face following the bottom landmarks with a constant height
from the 2D mask. Finally, we fill the convex hull and optionally mask it with irregular brushes as
in [7] or dilate the 3D box masks. The masking adaption is a flexible strategy, which not only locates
the position of the object across different views but also incorporates human priors by manually
annotating for some objects with very special shapes, such as the baseball bat in Appendix Fig. 13.

Experiments

Datasets. MVInpainter-O is trained on the object-centric data that includes full categories of
CO3D [57] and MVImgNet [95]. Moreover, we regard the Omni3D [6] as the zero-shot valida-
tion. MVInpainter-F is trained on the forward-facing data with Real10K [103], Scannet++ [89],
and DL3DV [41], including both indoor and outdoor scenes. We further employ comparison on
SPInNeRF [51] to verify the object removal ability. To mitigate the imbalanced category distribution,
we sample an equivalent subset of scenes for each category in every epoch. All images are resized
and cropped into 256×256 for both inpainting and flow extraction. More details about the dataset are
discussed in Appendix Sec. B.1. To the best of our knowledge, MVInpainter is the first scene-level
generative model that could be generalized on all categories of both CO3D and MVImgNet.

Dynamic Frame Sampling. To alleviate the training costs from long sequences, we first train MVIn-
painter with (N + 1) = 12 frames. Then, only a few steps (1/10) of fine-tuning with dynamic frame
numbers from (N + 1) ∈[8, 24] are sufficient for a good frame number adaption. For the inpainting
of more frames, frame interpolation-based inpainting introduced in Appendix Sec. B.2 should be
considered. Besides, we also randomly sample the frame interval to encourage generalization.

Training Setup. All trainings are accomplished on 8 A800 GPUs. We train MVInpainter-O and
MVInpainter-F for 100k and 60k steps with batch size 64, frame number 12, learning rate 1e-4 for 3
days and 2 days respectively. Then we fine-tune the model with dynamic frames for 10k steps.

Metrics. In this paper, we evaluate our method with PSNR, LPIPS [99], FID [27], and KID [5]. We
also include CLIP score [56] for the NVS task to verify the identity maintenance capability. For the
object removal, we further compare the similarity of DINOv2 features [52] extracted from masked

minimal DINOv2 similarity (DINO-M) among masked patches, respectively.

Object-Centric Results

Results of object-centric data are compared in Tab. 1 and Fig. 5. We considered two types of
approaches, including NVS manners: ZeroNVS [64]; inpainting-based methods: Nerfiller [80] and
LeftRefill [7]. Note that ZeroNVS requires explicit camera poses. Besides, the inpainting-based
methods are pose-free with enlarged bounding box masks to avoid masking shape leakage. Without
the inpainting formulation, the scene-level ZeroNVS struggles to directly synthesize novel views
without SDS. For inpainting-based approaches, LeftRefill can capture the scene’s main object but
fails to maintain multi-view consistency. Nerfiller only retains the shape of several views, while

Forward-Facing Results

Object Removal. We quantitatively verify the object removal ability of MVInpainter-F on SPInNeRF
test set [51] in the left of Tab. 2, while qualitative comparisons of the train set are shown in Fig. 8 of
Appendix. Other competitors include conventional single-view based inpainting manners: LaMa [70],
MAT [37], and SD-inpainting [59]. We further compare the pose-free reference-inpainting Left-
Refill [7] and the video inpainting manner ProPainter [102]. Formally, MAT and SD-inpainting
suffer from inconsistent inpainting results with poor DINO-A and DINO-M. Though LaMa achieves
the highest DINO-M, it generates consistent blur and artifacts as in Appendix Fig. 8(a). For the
reference-based manners, LeftRefill only conditions on the first view without multi-view consistency,
while ProPainter performs inferior in synthesis quality. Since the small test set, FID would be largely
degraded if one result contains artifacts. Our method enjoys the best performance in LPIPS, FID, and
DINO-A with consistent generations without any unstable hallucination.

Scene-Level Inpainting. We provide quantitative results of multi-view scene inpainting in the
right of Tab. 2 corrupted with large irregular masks. Our method achieves the best results of all
metrics, prominently outperforming video-based inpainting, reference-guided inpainting, and other
single-view inpainting approaches.

4.3
Real-World 3D Scene Editing

We verify the in-the-wild scene editing ability of MVInpainter following Sec. 3.4 in Fig. 6, where
the background images are from the unseen MipNeRF360 [2]. MVInpainter-F achieves stable and
consistent object removal, and MVInpainter-O performs high-quality multi-view generation for
various object shapes based on the flexible mask adaption. Benefiting from the consistent results, our
method enjoys reliable reconstruction with stereo-based Dust3R [76] and MVS [9]. Sec. C of the
Appendix discusses more details about the point cloud and 3DGS reconstruction.

Ablation Study

To verify the effectiveness of each component from MVInpainter, we conduct ablation studies on
CO3D as in Tab. 3. From Tab. 3a, the baseline is built upon SD1.5-inpainting with random-initialized
LoRA and motion transformer blocks, and we also compare the alternative baseline without the
inpainting formulation built upon naive SD1.5. The multi-view inpainting formulation largely
improves the results, and more details about the inpainting comparison are discussed in Appendix
Sec. B.4. Besides, we show qualitative ablation results in Fig. 7, which indicate that video priors
from AnimateDiff and Ref-KV could substantially facilitate the structure and appearance consistency
respectively. We also realize that object-level tracking masks are critical for training MVInpainter-O.
Moreover, we analyze the effect of flow grouping in Tab. 3b. Without any flow guidance, our
method fails in some ambiguous cases, such as large pose changes of stop signs and laptops in
Fig. 12 of Appendix, while dense flow slightly hinders the identity (PSNR and CLIP). The proposed
slot-attention based flow grouping outperforms the vanilla flow injection, while incorporating flow
embedding by cross-attention is more lightweight with comparable performance. Further, the flow
grouping can be improved with 3D temporal attention learning.

Conclusion

This paper proposes MVInpainter, a multi-view consistent inpainting method to expand 2D genera-
tions into 3D scenes by multi-view object removal, insertion, and replacement. MVInpainter enjoys
a pose-free inpainting formulation built upon the SD-inpainting backbone with motion modules.
Motion initialization based on video priors and Ref-KV are presented to facilitate the structure and
appearance consistency respectively. Furthermore, we propose to use flow grouping based on the
slot-attention to encourage implicit motion control. For the inference, we present a novel mask
adaption strategy to warp object masks to novel views. Sufficient experiments on both object-centric
and forward-facing datasets verified the effectiveness of MVInpainter.

More Details and Comparison

B.1
Dataset Details

We list detailed data information in Tab. 4. For the object-centric training data, CO3D [57] contains
24k sequences with 51 categories, and MVImgNet [95] contains about 210k sequences with 223
categories, while 15 categories of MVImgNet are seen as the zero-shot test set. Note that we discard
some images with too large foreground masks. For the forward-facing data, we choose 190 unseen
scenes from Real10K [103], Scannet++ [89], and DL3DV [41] as the mixed scene-level validation.
To quantitatively verify the object removal, 10 scenes are selected from SPInNeRF [51] test set
with consistent object masks and ground truth images without foregrounds. For the quantitative
comparison, we sample several test views for each scene at the maximum interval with officially
provided consistent object masks. Besides, we also provide qualitative results of these scenes sampled
from the training set with objects. All quantitative validations are based on 24 views, while qualitative
results are validated with 12 and 24 views separately. To simplify the visualization, our paper just
includes representative views rather than showing all views.

B.2
Frame Interpolation

To inpaint extremely long sequences, MVInpainter could first inpaint some keyframes, then apply the
frame interpolation-based inpainting to extend these keyframes to more views. Formally, we first
interactively mask and inpaint among keyframes like Fig. 16(a). Afterward, we uniformly sample
long-range inpainted results as fixed conditions at left (max to 12), and then interactively inpaint
other views to preserve the identity and appearance as Fig. 16(b).

B.3
Asymmetric VAE Decoder

We found some color difference near the masking boundary in some inpainting results as in Fig. 17,
especially for indoor cases with textureless regions. Moreover, we further found that this issue also
occurred with the original SD-inpainting. Hence, we follow the asymmetric VAE decoder [107] which
includes unmasked image pixels and masks as additional inputs, and apply the data augmentation
in [78] to fine-tune the VAE decoder. Though the quantitative results are almost unchanged, the
augmented new decoder enjoys much more consistent visualizations as shown in Fig. 17.

To verify the effect of the inpainting formulation, we further detail the comparison in Tab. 5 and

inpainting4. Both ‘SD-blend’ and ‘SD-NVS’ utilize vanilla SD1.55 as the backbone without any

inpainting fine-tuning and masking. The denoising process of ‘SD-blend’ is blended with unmasked
regions [47], while ‘Sd-NVS’ is fine-tuned with the whole view synthesis with a noise-free first
reference view. All models mentioned above are fine-tuned with random initialized LoRAs and
motion transformer blocks without other improvements (Ref-KV, AnimateDiff, flow grouping) on
CO3D. Both quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of the inpainting-based
baseline, which enjoys properly good pose formulation even without any pose guidance.

We found that fine-tuning the whole model with 1e-5 learning rate for SD backbone on mixed CO3D
and MVImgNet could further slightly facilitate the performance, as verified in Tab. 6. Thanks to the
effective inpainting formulation, the LoRA and motion transformer based fine-tuning is visually good
enough to handle our tasks. Moreover, training MVInpainter-O and MVInpainter-F with a shared SD
backbone enjoys efficient and flexible real-world usage. Because only a few parameters would be
resumed for different applications. We regard training a foundationally more powerful MVInpainter
as interesting future work.

B.6
Compared to NeRF Editing

We compare MVInpainter to the NeRF Editing method, SPIn-NeRF [51] in Fig. 19 and Tab. 7. Our
contributions are orthogonal to NeRF editing-based manners [51]. MVInpainter focuses on tackling
multi-view editing with a feed-forward model, while NeRF editing is devoted to reconstructing
instance-level scenes with test-time optimization. NeRF editing manners require exact camera poses
and costly test-time optimization for each instance (SPIn-NeRF needs about 1 hour for each scene).
Moreover, NeRF editing manners fail to substitute for our method: a) NeRF editing starts with
inconsistent 2D-inpainting results, which leads to blurred results as shown in Fig. 19, while our
method could refer to a high-quality single-view reference without conflicts. b) Although both
methods enjoy good consistency, rendering-based inpainting suffers from color difference when
blended with the original images (the last row of Fig. 19). As shown in Tab. 7, our method is
comparable to SPIn-NeRF in consistency (DINO-S, DINO-L) with better image quality (PSNR,
LPIPS, FID) and fidelity in their official object removal test set.

steps as the official setting. Our method is much more faster than other inpainting manners compared
to Nerfiller and Leftrefill. Nerfiller requires costly iterative updating, which is slow even with much
less de-noising steps. Leftrefill can only produce one view at once time rather than jointly produce all
target views as ours. Our method only costs a little more inference time compared to the baseline
AnimateDiff (+1.4s), which is mainly used by flow grouping and Ref-KV.

C
3D Scene Reconstruction

C.1
Dense Point Cloud

Since MVInpainter achieves consistent multi-view 2D generations, we simply employ some existing
3D reconstruction methods to further extend these results to 3D scenes without sophisticated pipelines.

Dust3R. First, we leverage the pose-free Dust3R [76] to achieve dense point clouds as the initialization
of 3DGS. We empirically find that 12 views are sufficient to achieve high-quality point clouds as
shown in Fig. 20(a) with only a few seconds. To ensure consistent initialization for 3DGS training,
we align all point clouds from Dust3R with the same camera pose system of Colmap. Although the
combined point clouds in Fig. 20(a) suffer a little inconsistency and outliers caused by errors from
Dust3R estimation and alignment, 3DGS could eliminate them.

Multi-View Stereo (MVS). For some more difficult cases, such as ‘room’ in MipNeRF360, Dust3R
fails to achieve consistent point clouds across all image pairs. Instead, we choose the SOTA learning-
based MVS method, MVSFormer++ [9], to reconstruct the dense point cloud with 24 input views as
shown in Fig. 21. MVS also takes a few seconds for the depth estimation and re-projecting correction,
which is as efficient as Dust3R. The success of MVS verifies that MVInpainter can produce consistent
multi-view inpainting, encouraging stereo-based reconstruction.

C.2
3DGS Reconstruction

To train 3DGS, we first interpolate inpainted results of ‘kitchen’ in MipNeRF360 to 48 views with
frame interpolation (Sec. B.2), where 42 frames are the training set; and 6 frames are the test set,
while the initialized point clouds are got from Dust3R. Besides, we use only 24 inpainted views of
‘room’ to verify the robustness of our method with sparser input views in complicated scenes, while

---Page Break---
require heavy SDS loss [64, 3] and dataset updates [26, 68, 80], the naive 3DGS could be simply
converged with our raw multi-view results. Following [48], we find that LPIPS loss [99] could further
alleviate the influence of slightly inconsistent appearance. However, learning 3DGS with only LPIPS
and SSIM losses as [48] is very unstable for real-world scenes’ reconstruction in our pilot study.
Instead, we optimize LPIPS loss only for the foreground object as:

L3dgs = λL1 + (1 −λ)Lssim + m ⊙λlpipsLlpips,
(4)

where m is the foreground mask from SAM-tracking [88]; ⊙is element-wise multiplication; λ =
0.2, λlpips = 0.1 respectively. Thanks to the consistent multi-view results, we empirically find
that just 5k training steps with 3 minutes could achieve good 3DGS results as in Fig. 20(b)(c).
Furthermore, the local-based LPIPS loss further facilitates the performance with clear boundaries.
Specifically, for the baseball bat in Fig. 20(a), the final dense point cloud struggles to perfectly unify
point clouds from all views, because of the challenging long shape that magnified the Dust3R stereo
and mask adaption errors. However, our local LPIPS-based 3DGS can largely alleviate this issue with
consistent outcomes. We recommend comparing the video results of inpainted multi-view images
and 3DGS in our supplementary.

Limitations

Figure 22: Limitations of MVInpainter-F, failing to tackle the complicated 360◦scene inpainting,
where the background is completely different from the reference one.

Although our work enjoys good consistency and outstanding generalization compared to previous
manners, some dilemmas are still retained. As shown in Fig. 22, when meeting intractable 360◦
scene inpainting, our method achieves good results in the foreground regions which are consistently
captured by the reference view. But our method fails to recover proper consistent structures for the
completely unseen backgrounds, as magnified in red boxes of columns 8 and 9 in Fig. 22. This
is caused by the limited respective fields of Ref-KV, and constrained training capacity (frozen SD
backbone and limited training data of large viewpoint changes). However, we should clarify that the
Ref-KV is sufficiently effective for most scenarios as verified in our ablation study, which is much
more efficient than the full attention. Scaling up the multi-view inpainting model with more powerful
attention mechanisms and more high-quality data is interesting future work.

Broader Impacts

This paper exploited multi-view consistent inpainting based on text-to-image models. Because of their
powerful generative capacity, these models would produce misinformation or fake images. So we
sincerely remind users to pay attention to it. Besides, privacy and consent are important considerations,
as generative models are often trained on large-scale data. Furthermore, generative models may
perpetuate some biases according to the training data, leading to unfair outcomes. Therefore, we
recommend users be responsible and inclusive while using these text-to-image generative models.
Note that our method only focuses on technical aspects. Both images and pre-trained models used in
this paper are all open-released.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: our abstract clearly clarifies our contributions: re-formulating 3D scene editing
as a pose-free multi-view inpainting task.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we have included our limitation in Sec. D.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

29


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper did not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: our experiments are reproducible, and all codes and models will be open-
released.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

30


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All data used in our experiments are open-released, and our codes will also be
open-released.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we include detailed implementation in Sec. 4. The full details can be seen in
our codes, which would be open-released.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: As a visual generative model, we provide sufficient visualization results
instead.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

31


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: see in Sec. 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: our work conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: see in Sec. E.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

32


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: our paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we have cited related works and codes.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

33


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not release new assets for now. Codes and models will be
open-released soon.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
