Abstract

Research on scaling large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on
model parameters and training data size, overlooking the role of vocabulary
size. We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training
models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various
vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for
predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative
estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the
conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the compute budget, with
larger models requiring larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient
vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of
Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary
of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B
parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal
vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly
used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional
32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with
the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work highlights the importance of jointly considering
tokenization and model scaling for efficient pre-training. The code and demo

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance by pre-training on vast text
corpora using massive computational resources [47]. Extensive prior work on LLMs has focused on
deriving so-called scaling laws: a set of empirical formulas to predict how model performance scales,
mainly as computing floating-point operations (FLOPs), model parameters, and quantity of training
data change [30, 26, 66, 2, 44, 58]. These works show that power-law fits can effectively predict
language modeling loss and by extension downstream performance [23, 55]. However, these scaling
laws usually disregard the impact of the vocabulary size. For example, in Kaplan et al. [30] only
non-vocabulary parameters are considered in their predictive formula. This negligence has resulted
in substantial variability in the vocabulary size of current LLMs. For instance, Llama2-7B employs
a vocabulary size of 32K [70], while Gemma-7B [67] adopts a much larger vocabulary size of 256K
despite both having a similar number of total parameters. This variability in vocabulary sizes across
LLMs raises the research question: What is the compute-optimal vocabulary size for a LLM?

Figure 1: The relationship between non-vocabulary parameters Nnv and the corresponding optimal
vocabulary parameters N opt
v
follows a power law, where N opt
v
should be scaled slower than Nnv
as γ < 1. Empirical results align with predictions of our proposed approaches, with larger circles
indicating higher loss values. Here V refers to the vocabulary size i.e. the number of distinct tokens.

The vocabulary size affects performance non-trivially. Intuitively, the optimal vocabulary size
should neither be too large nor small. A larger vocabulary size improves tokenization fertility, i.e.,
splitting sentences into fewer tokens, thereby improving the tokenization efficiency. Additionally,
a larger vocabulary enables the model to capture a wider range of concept. However, the risk of
under-fitting for rare tokens increases with larger vocabulary sizes, especially in the data-constrained
regime [44, 72]. Thus, the optimal vocabulary size needs to be determined by taking the training
data and the non-vocabulary parameters into account.

In this paper, we show that the effect of vocabulary on scaling laws has been underestimated, and
we quantify the effect to derive a prediction for the optimal vocabulary size. We first introduce a
normalized loss formulation to ensure a fair comparison across models with varying vocabulary sizes.
Utilizing the normalized loss function, we analyze and discuss the underlying rationale behind the
existence of an optimal vocabulary size, which depends on the available computational budget.

To predict the optimal vocabulary size given a compute budget, we propose three approaches.
Approach 1 (Estimating power laws via IsoFLOPs): We pre-train models with non-vocabulary pa-
rameters ranging from 33M to 1.13B, with groups of models that share the same FLOPs (“IsoFLOPs”)
but varying vocabulary configurations. Then, we fit power laws relating FLOPs to non-vocabulary
parameters, vocabulary parameters, and training data, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the
optimal vocabulary parameters exhibit a power-law growth with respect to the computational budget,
however, at a slower rate than non-vocabulary parameters, as shown in Figure 1. Approach 2
(Derivative-based Estimation): We introduce a derivative-based method that estimates the optimal
vocabulary size by using the derivative of FLOPs w.r.t. the vocabulary size and finding the corre-
sponding zero solution. Approach 3 (Parametric Fit of Loss Formula): We modify Chinchilla
scaling laws [26] to incorporate vocabulary and fit the resulting formula on our models to predict
the normalized loss function based on non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary parameters, and the
amount of training characters jointly. While the prior two approaches are limited to compute-optimal
settings, this approach also allows us to determine the optimal vocabulary when the allocation is
suboptimal i.e. the model parameters are either trained for too many tokens (“overtrained”) or for
too few tokens (“undertrained”). Overtraining is very common [23], such as Llama 2 7B [70] which
was trained for 2 trillion tokens, significantly more than the compute-optimal allocation of a 7 billion
parameter model of around 150B tokens.

As shown in Figure 1, we observe that the relationship between non-vocabulary parameters Nnv and
their correspondng optimal vocabulary parameters N opt
v
follows a power law, according to all of
our approaches. Our prediction also suggests that vocabulary parameters should be scaled slower
than non-vocabulary parameters, i.e., N opt
v
∝N γ
nv where γ ≈0.83 < 1. Nevertheless, most of
existing LLMs [33, 81, 67, 41, 4, 25, 12, 7, 46, 84] neglect the importance of vocabulary and allocate
less vocabulary parameters than the suggestions, shown in Figure 2. Note that we assume that

Public LLMs

Figure 2: Vocabulary parameters of popular LLMs and predicted optimal vocabulary parameters at
a compute-optimal number of training tokens. Most current LLMs have suboptimal vocabulary
parameters due to vocabulary sizes, which are smaller than the predicted optimal values. Among the
current models, StarCoder2-3B, OLMo-7B, InternLM2-20B, and Gemma2-27B have vocabulary
sizes that come closest to the optimal allocation for their respective model sizes.

the amount of training data for these models is optimally distributed according to Hoffmann et al.
[26]. Considering that several LLMs are trained on substantially more data than optimal ones (e.g.,
Llama2), the optimal vocabulary sizes would likely be larger than currently estimated.

Finally, we empirically verify our predictions on models with 3B parameter models. By using our
approach to predict the expected vocabulary size in various practical cases when (1) the training data
is insufficient (“undertraining”); (2) the training data is equally scaled with the model parameters, fol-
lowing the Chinchilla laws (“compute-optimal training”) [26]; (3) the training data is overly sufficient
like in Llama [70] (“overtraining”). The results show that models with our suggested vocabulary sizes
steadily outperform baselines adopting commonly used vocabulary configurations under the same
FLOPs budget. Our research underscores the overlooked importance of vocabulary and the need to
jointly consider the vocabulary size, model parameters, and training data for effective scaling.

Preliminary

In this section, we first present a general formulation of a commonly used scaling law, and then
demonstrate how to modify it to incorporate the vocabulary.

2.1
Scaling law

Scaling laws consider a computational budget, C, which is measured in FLOPs. The goal is to
optimally allocate the compute budget to model parameters N and the number of training tokens D
[30, 6, 26, 44]. It can be formulated as:

(N opt, Dopt) = arg min
N,D L(N, D)
s.t. FLOPs(N, D) = C,
(1)

Following Radford et al. [51], the loss function is typically the language modeling loss when
evaluating language models, which can be written as:

L = −1

T

T
X

i=1
log p(wi|w1:i−1, V ),
(2)

where p(wi|w1:i−1, V ) is the output probability of word wi given the context w1:i−1 and the tokenizer
with vocabulary size V . Generally, the lower L indicates better performance of the language model.
However, due to its dependency on V , L cannot be used to compare language models with different
vocabulary sizes. Thus, we propose an adaptation later in §2.2. Fitting scaling laws generally requires
various models trained for different configurations [23]. A common approach is to select several

3


---Page Break---
compute budgets and train models with varying N and D for each budget to find the best one, i.e. the
one with the lowest loss (“IsoFLOPs”) [26]. Using fitting techniques we can then estimate a function
that maps from the compute budget to the optimal allocation to N and D.

2.2
Scaling law with vocabulary

As prior work generally assumes the vocabulary size to be fixed, we cannot adopt the attributes in
their scaling laws and their evaluation metric directly. Thus, we detail several considerations that
allow us to investigate vocabulary scaling laws.

Attributes
Scaling laws commonly deal with the attributes, model parameters (N) and number of
training tokens (D) [26, 44]. We adapt them for our analysis in the context of vocabulary size. (1) We
break down the total model parameters (N) into non-vocabulary (Nnv) and vocabulary parameters
(Nv). To understand the importance of vocabulary parameters, we isolate them from other model
parameters, where N = Nnv + Nv. We use Nv = V d to represent both the vocabulary parameters
in the output layer 1. Notably, to change Nv we only vary the vocabulary size V and take the
embedding dimension d as given based on Nnv empirically, see §A.7.2 for details. This is based on
the observation by Kaplan et al. [30] that the performance of models with varying depth-to-width
ratios converges to a single trend. We also provide further analysis about why we break down the
model parameters from the perspective of parameter growing in §A.6. (2) We measure data not
in tokens (D) but in training characters (H). The number of tokens depends on the vocabulary of
the tokenizer. By studying training characters, we can better see how the data volume affects the
performance regardless of different vocabulary sizes.

Mapping from training characters (H) to tokens (D)
As detailed above we measure training
data in training characters (H). Nonetheless, to connect our findings with existing studies on scaling
laws [26, 44], we need to be able to map from H to D. This mapping is the tokenizer’s compression
ratio which can be computed via D/H. The more tokens the tokenizer needs to represent H, the
larger D, and thus it compresses less. We develop a simple function f(V ) to estimate this ratio solely
from the chosen vocabulary size, V . Specifically, we find that a quadratic function on the logarithmic
value of V achieves accurate predictions:

f(V ) = a log2(V ) + b log(V ) + c
(3)

By fitting several tokenizers with V ranging from 1K to 1024K, we obtain a = 0.0064, b = −0.1581
and c = 1.2047. We find that our function accurately predicts the compression ratio with a low
relative mean square error (RMSE) and a high coefficient of determination (R2). In §A.9, we
visualize fitting results and show that our approximation works with different tokenizers and is robust
to different V . For all our main experiments, we use the BPE algorithm for tokenization [59].

Vocabulary-insensitive loss
To fairly assess models that vary in V , the commonly used language
model loss in Equation 2 is inappropriate. Models trained with larger V naturally have a higher
loss, as there are more possibilities in the vocabulary to predict. However, this does not mean that
the model is worse. Thus, we need to normalize the loss with respect to the vocabulary size. We
reformulate the unigram-normalized metric [54] as a loss function. Suppose we have a T-length
sequence w1:T , we design the unigram-normalized language model loss as:

Lu = −1

T

T
X

i=1
log p(wi|w1:i−1, V )

p(wi|V )
,
(4)

where p(wi|V ) is the frequency of word wi in the tokenized corpus, given the tokenizer with
vocabulary size V . The loss indicates the improvement in probability that a context-aware language
model offers over a unigram model without context, allowing us to assess the language model’s
efficacy. Based on theory from prior work [54], the normalized loss Lu remains consistent for a
given model with a fixed non-vocabulary component across different vocabulary sizes. The difference
of Lu comes from the ability of the language model itself. Compared with L, the value of Lu is
much smaller and can be negative as Lu adds a negative term 1

T
PT
i=1 log p(wi|V ). One may also

1Vocabulary parameters typically encompass both the word embedding layer and the output layer. In this
paper, for clarity and analytical simplicity, we employ V d rather than 2V d to represent the vocabulary parameters.
This choice is predicated on empirical observations: the main computational burden, as measured in FLOPs, is
associated with the output layer, but not the word embedding layer.

Figure 3: Left: FLOPs curve with various vocabulary sizes, assuming all configurations achieve
a fixed loss. There exists an optimal vocabulary size that minimizes FLOPs. Right: Loss curves
with various vocabulary sizes given different FLOP budgets. For each budget there exists an optimal
vocabulary size that minimizes loss. As the FLOP budget increases this optimal vocabulary size
increases (shifts to the right).

employ the average bits per character (BPC), a common metric for text compression [27], as the
vocabulary-insensitive loss. The only difference lies in the normalization. BPC represents the raw
per-character language model loss over the corpus, while our Lu is equivalent to the per-character
language model loss normalized by the frequency of each character. In practice, we find that the
metric BPC and Lu show a significant positive correlation, which experimentally validated our
statement, as detailed in the §A.5.

Analysis: Why the optimal vocabulary size is bounded by compute

Analysis 1: The perspective of fixed normalized loss
According to Kaplan et al. [30], the FLOPs
(C) of a Transformer model can be estimated as C ≈6ND, which can be re-written as:

C ≈6ND ≈6(Nnv + V d)Hf(V ),
(5)

where N = Nnv + Nv and D = Hf(V ) based on §2.2. The reasons why model performance
first increases and then decreases as the vocabulary size grows are: (1) At small V , increasing the
vocabulary size easily improves tokenization fertility from f(V ). Subsequently, more characters can
be learned from the model with a fixed number of tokens, thereby improving model performance. (2)
At very large V , the gain from tokenization fertility decreases, while the parameters from expanding
the vocabulary cannot be adequately trained with limited data, which leads to a decline in model
performance. We present an expanded derivation in §A.1, and show how the corresponding FLOPs
change with the vocabulary size in Figure 3 (left).

Analysis 2: The perspective of fixed FLOP budget
Given a fixed FLOPs budget, we isolate the
FLOPs and investigate how the vocabulary influences the loss. For ease, we train models with fixed
Nnv and different vocabulary sizes for the same steps, and then we use interpolation to predict the
loss when FLOPs reaches the budget given the observed FLOPs and loss points. For each budget, we
adopt a group of models with similar total parameters and vary vocabulary sizes. In Figure 3 (right)
we plot the relationship between the loss w.r.t. the vocabulary size. It reveals that the vocabulary
corresponding to the lowest point on the loss curve increases as the FLOPs budget increases. This
suggests that with more computational resources, LLMs can harness larger vocabularies to reduce
loss. However, merely expanding the vocabulary does not always lower the loss. For a fixed FLOPs
budget, the loss initially decreases with the increase in vocabulary and then starts to rise, indicating
that an optimal point exists for the vocabulary.

Estimating the optimal vocabulary size

In this section, we describe three complementary approaches to estimate the optimal vocabulary size.

5


---Page Break---
4.1
Approach 1: Estimating power laws via IsoFLOPs

We define 6 groups of models with Nnv ranging from 33M to 1.13B. Within each group, we solely
vary the vocabulary size V from 4K to 96K, and evaluate different models under the same FLOPs
budget. We evaluate the normalized loss Lu on a held-out validation dataset. This approach allows
us to directly answer the question: For a given FLOPs budget, what is the optimal allocation to
non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary parameters, and training data?

Figure 4: Training curves of the experiments used
in Approach 1 (§4.1) and Approach 3 (§4.3). We
train models with the non-vocabulary parameters
fixed and vocabulary sizes varying from 4K to 96K.

Setup
Given a certain Nv, the embedding di-
mension d is fixed, thus Nv increases as V in-
creases. For all experiments, we uniformly sam-
ple the training data from different domains in
the SlimPajama dataset [61]. All other hyperpa-
rameters are fixed with more details in §A.7.

Fitting
We select data points with the mini-
mum Lu for each FLOP budget, with all runs
visualized in Figure 4. These points are the
compute-optimal allocation to (Nnv, Nv, H).
Following Kaplan et al. [30] and Hoffmann et al.
[26], we hypothesize that the optimal vocabu-
lary parameters Nv meet a power law w.r.t. the
FLOPs C, just like the non-vocabulary parame-
ters and the amount of training data. Specifically,
Nnv = k1Cα1,Nv = k2Cα2 and H = k3Cα3.
As model size and training data should be scaled
equally for compute-optimal training [26], we
set α1 = α3. As our new attribute V signifi-
cantly increases the number of possible experimental configurations, we employ interpolation across
data points to obtain more configurations cheaply. The details of the fitting are in §A.7.4.

Figure 5: Fitting results of the Approach 1. Blue stars denote the selected data points where the
combination (Nnv, Nv, H) reaches the lowest loss given various FLOPs budgets. We find power law
fits with respect to the optimal non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary parameters, and the number of
training characters, respectively.

Results and Usage
In Figure 5, we display the fitted power laws: Nnv = 0.08 ∗C0.50, Nv =
0.20∗C0.42 and H = 6.42∗C0.50, where C is the FLOPs budget.The low RMSE and high R2 values
indicate the strength of our fit. Given a certain FLOPs budget, we can utilize the aforementioned
relationships to obtain the optimal allocation (Nnv, Nv, H). We also draw the following conclusions:
(1) LLMs are data-hungry. Compared to the non-vocabulary parameters Nnv, practitioners should
allocate more compute to the training data [80, 44]. (2) Vocabulary parameters scale in a power-
law relation with FLOPs (Nv ∝C0.42). As models become more computationally intensive, a
larger vocabulary enhances the model’s ability to understand a more diverse array of text, and thus the
vocabulary size is critical to scaling. (3) Vocabulary parameters Nv should be scaled slower than
non-vocabulary parameters Nnv. This difference can be seen in their power law exponents, i.e.
γ = 0.42/0.50 = 0.84 < 1. We hypothesize the reason is that: once a sufficiently rich embedding
space is present via a large vocabulary, it is more critical to scale non-vocabulary parameters to learn
the intricate syntactic and semantic structures of language via Transformer blocks.

4.2
Approach 2: Derivative-based fast estimation

We propose an alternative approach leveraging insights from the estimation of the FLOPs itself. Prior
work [26, 30] usually considers a fixed compute budget in FLOPs and then aims to minimize loss by
finding the optimal allocation to model parameters N and training tokens D. Here we flip this recipe
on its head following recent work [57]. We aim to find the minimum FLOPs to achieve a certain loss
Lu(Nnv, V, H) = ℓthrough optimal allocation of the vocabulary size V :

V =
arg min
V |Lu(Nnv,V,H)=ℓ
C(Nnv, Nv, H).
(6)

By computing the minimum point of FLOPs C with respect to V via derivative:

∂C
∂V = 6H

"

(Nnv + V d)2a log(V ) + b

V
+

a(log(V ))2 + b log(V ) + c

d

#

,
(7)

we can estimate the optimal V
under the assumption that it can achieve a certain loss
Lu(Nnv, V, H) = ℓ. The parameters a, b and c can be easily obtained from building f(V ) (§2.2). In
theory, as long as the non-vocabulary parameters Nnv are provided, V can be numerically searched
via the solution of ∂C

∂V = 0. More details are in §A.1.

Usage
When the compute allocation is near optimal, the loss exhibits a power-law relationship
with respect to the FLOPs budget, as described by the scaling law [30]. This relationship allows
us to use FLOPs as a reliable proxy for observing the scaling behavior of the optimal vocabulary
parameters. In practice, we can first determine an empirically optimal vocabulary size in a low-cost
setting (e.g., finding the compute-optimal vocabulary parameters on a small model). Then, we
can scale the optimal vocabulary parameters proportionally based on γ. Specifically, we obtain a
set of derivative-optimal vocabulary parameters Nv for different non-vocabulary parameters Nnv,
represented as

(N i
nv, N i
v)|i = 1, · · · , n
	
. We then fit the relationship between Nnv and Nv using
the power-law function Nv ∝N γ
nv. This results in the scaling equation: Nv/N 0
v = (Nnv/N 0
nv)γ
where N 0
nv is a small model (e.g., 33M), and N 0
v is the searched optimal vocabulary parameter. By
combining the γ from the derivative and the empirical solution on a small model, we can estimate the
optimal vocabulary by:

N opt
v
= N 0
v ∗(Nnv

N 0nv
)γ,

where the scaling proportion γ = 0.83 after our fitting. Consistent with the observation in Approach
1, we find that non-vocabulary parameters should be scaled faster than vocabulary parameters to
achieve an optimal allocation.

4.3
Approach 3: Parametric fit of loss formula

Finally, we directly predict the loss given the non-vocabulary parameter, vocabulary parameter and
the amount of training characters. Then, the optimal vocabulary configuration can be predicted
by finding the minimum point of loss with respect to the vocabulary. Following a classical risk
decomposition used in Hoffmann et al. [26], we design the vocabulary-dependent loss formula as:

Lu = −E + A1

N α1
nv
+ A2

N α2
v
+ B

Dβ ,
(8)

where D = Hf(V ). The first term captures the normalized loss for an ideal generative process. The
subsequent terms reflect the effect of the non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary parameters, and the
number of training data on the loss, respectively. E, A1, A2, B, α1, α2, β are learned parameters.

Fitting
We use the points (Nnv, Nv, H) collected for experiments in §4.1. Note that we do not
only consider the points with the lowest loss for each FLOP budget as we want to predict loss for
any combination of (Nnv, Nv, H). We add the constraint α1 = β following Muennighoff et al.
[44]. We also filter out points with very small FLOPs following Hoffmann et al. [26]. Fitting yields
A1 = 1.831, A2 = 0.196, B = 2.124, E = 5.533, α1 = β = 0.447, α2 = 0.671. The detailed
fitting process is written in §A.7.4.

Usage
After fitting the parameters in Equation 8, the optimal vocabulary size can be obtained by
finding the lowest loss w.r.t the vocabulary size, with a constraint of FLOPs budget. For example,

Figure 6: Vocabulary parameters of popular LLMs and predicted optimal vocabulary parameters
at their reported number of training tokens, as determined by our Approach 3 (§4.3). Here we
consider the practical scenarios where parameters and training data are not necessarily equally scaled.
As illustrated, the vocabulary parameters remain predominantly underestimated. With the exception
of Gemma2-9B, all models allocate a smaller vocabulary parameter count than our prediction.

given Nnv and FLOPs budget C , by replacing [Hf(V )] with C/(6(Nnv + Nv)) and finding the
solution of ∂Lu

∂V = 0 via numerical search, we can get the prediction. The details of ∂Lu

∂V is written
in §A.2. Note that all of the proposed approaches can be used in optimally allocating (Nnv, Nv, H)
altogether, while Approach 3 is more flexible in predicting the locally optimal Nv when (Nnv, H) are
not following the Chinchilla’s law [26], i.e. equally-scaled law. The reason is that the loss formula in
Approach 3 does not only considers the combinations (Nnv, Nv, H) which reach the optimal given
a certain training budget. By fixing Nnv and varying C in Approach 3, we can predict the locally
optimal vocabulary size with different amount of training characters. This property makes Approach
3 more valuable, since modern LLMs [70, 67, 3, 4, 7] usually leverage overly sufficient training data
to build powerful models with relatively low inference costs.

In Figure 6, we remove the assumption [26] for the practical reason that the parameters and training
data are not equally scaled. Then, we predict the locally optimal vocabulary parameters. It can be
observed that the allocation of vocabulary parameters are typically under-estimated.

Discussion

Predicting allocations for larger models
Table 1 reports the predicted optimal vocabulary parame-
ters and sizes based on the proposed three approaches, where the amount of training data is optimally

Table 1: We report the predicted optimal vocabulary parameters Nv and the vocabulary size V by the
proposed three approaches given Nnv. We assume the training FLOPs are optimally allocated i.e.
that the non-vocabulary parameters and training data are scaled equally. “App” denotes the approach.

allocated, i.e. equally scaled with the non-vocabulary parameters [26]. Aligned with the trend shown
in Figure 1, the predictions from all proposed approaches align closely. Nnv should be scaled faster
than Nv. Notably, mainstream LLMs typically assign fewer parameters to vocabulary than what is
optimal. However, the community is starting to shift to larger vocabularies, such as with Llama3 [41]
having a 128K vocabulary size up from 32K of Llama2 [70]. However, scaling data is still the most
critical part, and solving data scarcity issues should be a focus of future work [72].

To empirically verify our prediction, we train models with Nnv = 2.87B under a compute-optimal
training FLOPs budget and evaluate them using lighteval 2. For the baseline model we use the
common vocabulary size of V = 32K. The other model uses V opt as predicted by Approach 3.
In Table 2, we show that the model allocated according to our vocabulary predictions yields better
performance across multiple downstream tasks. This verifies that our predictions hold at scale.

Experiments with scarce and excessive training data
Our prior experiments focus on the setting
where training compute budget is the main constraint and we seek to allocate it optimally to parameters
and training data. This is the typical setting in scaling law studies [30, 26, 52]. However, in the real
world, we often deal with scarce data (“data-constrained [44]”) forcing us to train sub-optimally or
would like to make use of excessive data to train a smaller model that is cheaper to use [84]. To verify
that our Approach 3 can handle these practical scenarios, we compare the model with V = 32K
and the model with the vocabulary size V opt predicted by Approach 3. As shown in Table 3, our
prediction enables a better model by only adjusting the vocabulary size in different FLOPs budgets.

In Figure 7, we further study the trend about how does the optimal vocabulary size shift with
different number of training data. We only vary the amount of data but keep the non-vocabulary
parameters fixed. The choices of vocabulary size are 8K, 10K, 16K, 24K, 32K and 48K. Taking
Nnv = 302M as an example, when available data is the bottleneck, the optimal vocabulary size
decreases empirically, i.e. 16K →10K. This is a mechanism to prevent over-fitting. Conversely,
when training on excessive amounts of data, e.g., Llama3-8B uses much more training tokens
than what would be compute-optimal for its budget, the optimal vocabulary size increases, i.e.
16K →24K. Note that here we focus solely on training compute-optimal. It is also important to
note that expanding the vocabulary size also increases the computational demands during inference.
Therefore, we recommend using the optimal vocabulary size corresponding to a given Nnv,
assuming optimal allocation of training data, even in scenarios where overtraining may occur.

Figure 7: Left: The heatmap illustrates how the best vocabulary size among all choices of vocabularies
shifts with the training data. The non-vocabulary parameter is fixed (Nnv = 302M). Each cell in
the heatmap represents the loss given a certain FLOPs budget for a fair evaluation, with the color
intensity indicating the loss value. The black line with markers denotes the best vocabulary size for
each FLOPs budget, which basically increases as the number of training data increases. Right: The
number of training tokens are slightly varying for different vocabulary sizes given a certain FLOPs
budget. To keep FLOPs consistent, models with larger vocabulary sizes are trained on fewer tokens.

Language models
The Transformer [71] has proven to be a scalable architecture for language
models, especially large language model (LLMs) [11, 14, 52, 47, 20, 29, 53, 70, 73, 41, 8, 4, 38, 25,
62, 67, 7, 39, 32, 88]. These models typically acquire a deep understanding of language enabling
them to perform multiple tasks after a pre-training period and an optional fine-tuning period. Their
capabilities include code generation [33, 3, 43, 87, 86], mathematical reasoning [76, 5], question
answering [48, 45] among others. Given the expensive deployment costs required by the language
models, various techniques can be adopted for efficient inference [64, 65, 78, 74, 36]. In our work,
we pre-train large language models from scratch on English corpora and focus on their validation
loss and downstream performance after training.

Scaling laws
Scaling laws aim to develop a predictive framework to find the best allocation of
compute resources to maximize model performance. Besides language models, they have been
studied in other domains[40, 68, 13]. For language models, Kaplan et al. [30] show that performance
improves as a power law with more compute allocated to both parameters or data. Hoffmann et al.
[26] show that the compute allocation of parameters and data should be scaled equally. Other work
considers various cases such as downstream performance [23, 28, 55], inference time [57] or data
constraints [44, 80]. However, the effect of vocabulary size has generally been ignored previously.

Conclusion

We investigate the impact of the vocabulary size in language models. We analyze and verify that there
exists an optimal vocabulary size for a given FLOPs budget. Subsequently, we develop 3 approaches
to predict the optimal vocabulary size. Our first approach uses empirical training runs across different
IsoFLOPs regimes to fit a scaling law. The second approach investigates the FLOPs w.r.t. the
vocabulary size and estimates the vocabulary size with derivatives. The third approach consists of a
parametric function to predict the impact of different attributes on loss. Across all approaches, we find
that while vocabulary parameters should be scaled slower than other parameters, they are still critical
for performance and we can accurately predict their optimal allocation. We make predictions for
larger models and empirically verify our approaches on up to 3B parameters and on varying amounts
of training data. We show that models trained with an optimal vocabulary size as predicted by our
approaches outperform models with a conventional vocabulary size under the same FLOPs budget.

The derivation of FLOPs w.r.t the vocabulary size for the Approach 2

Here we provide the detailed process of how we compute the extreme point of FLOPs C with respect
to V . From Kaplan et al. [30], we know that:

C ≈6ND ≈6(Nnv + V d)Hf(V ).
(9)

We then compute the derivative ∂C

∂V as follows:

∂C
∂V =
∂
∂V [6(Nnv + dV )H (f(V ))]

=

.

The solution of ∂C

∂V = 0 corresponds to the minimum point of the FLOPs. Since the variable
V in this equation is not separated conveniently, we use a numerical search method, specifically
scipy.optimize.fsolve, to find the solution.

Example demonstration
Figure 8 illustrates the relationship between the derivative of FLOPs with
respect to the vocabulary size V and V itself. Setting V as the solution to ∂C

∂V = 0, we find the point
at which FLOPs are minimized. As depicted in Figure 8 (right), the FLOPs budget is fixed, and we
observe how the training character varies with V . Notably, at the optimal vocabulary size V , the
model expends the maximum number of training characters for a given budget. This observation
provides insight into why an optimal vocabulary size exists for a given FLOPs budget.

Figure 8: Left: The curve of the derivative of FLOPs with respect to vocabulary size V . The curve of
∂C
∂V increases as V increases, and the FLOPs reach a minima at the solution of ∂C

∂V = 0. Middle: The
curve of FLOPs with respect to vocabulary size V , where V reaches its optimal point V . Right: The
curve of training characters with a given FLOPs budget. Take Nnv = 302M and H = 43B as an
example. The FLOPs budget is decided by the Nnv, H and the predicted V .

A.2
The derivation of loss w.r.t the vocabulary size in Approach 3

Here we provide how we derive the loss w.r.t the vocabulary size given a FLOPs budget C in Approach
3. After substituting the [Hf(V )] with the C/(6(Nnv + Nv) based on Equation 9:

The loss is solely dependent on the Nv = V d, given a Nnv. The derivative w.r.t. V is:

The solution of ∂Lu

Similar with Approach 2, we use
scipy.optimize.fsolve to find the solution.

A.3
More visualizations for the analyses: Why the optimal vocabulary size is bounded by the
compute

Figure 9: The SVD plots of the learned word embedding for V=4K (left), V=16K (middle) and
V=64K (right) for a model with Nnv = 85M. Different colors represent different log frequencies.

Word embeddings in a large vocabulary are hard to learn when FLOPs are constrained
Previous studies have shown embeddings suffer from representation degradation, where low-frequency
word embeddings cluster together due to limited parameter updating [24]. In Figure 9, we visualize
how the word embeddings distribute using different vocabulary sizes. We use the average Euclidean
distance among all the embeddings, Davg, to quantify the degree of clustering, which is 1.067, 1.011,
and 0.952 for V = 4K, V = 16K and V = 64K, respectively. Larger vocabularies (64K) lead
to more clustering of embeddings, especially for infrequent words. This clustering suggests that
they have been insufficiently trained. Conversely, a small-sized vocabulary (4K) and middle-sized
vocabulary (16K) display a more dispersed distribution of embeddings. These observations suggest
that there exists an optimal vocabulary size that balances lexicon coverage and sufficient updating of
word embedding. Language models with large vocabulary sizes may have better lexicon coverage, but
on the other hand, hinder the model’s ability to sufficiently update the word embeddings, especially
for low-frequency words.

A.4
Exploration of Larger Range of Vocabulary Sizes

Because of computational resource constraints, the vocabulary sizes we used to fit the scaling laws
are in the range of 4K to 96K. This range is sufficient to fit, because the optimal vocabulary sizes for
all the training configurations we used fall in this range.

To further verify that there is always an optimal vocabulary size holds for a larger range of vocabulary
lists, we increase the range of vocabulary sizes from 0.5K to 512K, with the Nnv fixed as 33M.
As depicted in the Figure 10, the model’s performance declines consistently as the vocabulary size
increases beyond the optimal configuration. This figure shows loss curves for vocabulary sizes
up to 512K, given a specific FLOPs budget. The data indicates a consistent degradation in model
performance with the vocabulary size away from the optimal one. It suggests that there is a critical

point beyond which the model’s efficiency in handling the vocabulary diminishes. This exploration
underscores the importance of carefully selecting the vocabulary size to maintain optimal model
performance within the constraints of a given computational budget.

The Vocabulary-insensitive Metric: Lu and BPC

Figure 11: Correlation between the unigram-normalized loss Lu and BPC, where ρ and e denote the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the root mean square error of the linear fit, respectively.

BPC reflects the ability to compress external text corpora [27], while the unigram-normalized loss
reflects the model’s ability to predict tokens normalized by the token frequency. Figure 11 shows
the relationship between the Unigram-normalized Loss Lu and Bits Per Character (BPC) with a
linear fit. We select the models of the final training steps for each Nnv and each vocabulary size.
The high correlation coefficient (ρ = 0.9888) and low error (e = 0.0683) indicate a strong linear
relationship between these two metrics generally. However, it exists slight different trends due to
different normalizations.

A.6
More Explanations about Why We Separate Vocabulary Parameters from the total
Model Parameters

Traditionally, scaling up model parameters in language models has been approached in two ways:
increasing depth (i.e., the number of layers) or width (i.e., the hidden size). While extensive research
has been conducted on these methods, current empirical practices often involve expanding both
simultaneously [66]. This approach, however, may overlook crucial distinctions in how different
parameters benefit from these expansions.

Non-vocabulary parameters can benefit from increases in both depth and width, allowing for more
complex hierarchical representations and broader feature capture. In contrast, vocabulary parameters,
associated with word embeddings and language model heads, are generally confined to a single
layer, limiting their ability to benefit from increases in the model depth. Their primary avenue for
expansion is through increasing the width. This disparity in growth potential between non-vocabulary
and vocabulary parameters suggests that to maintain a balanced growth rate, it may be necessary to
expand the vocabulary size along with the depth. This would allow the vocabulary parameters to keep
pace with the growth of non-vocabulary parameters.

Implementation details

A.7.1
Setting of model architecture, vocabulary size and training characters

We list the architectures of the models and the corresponding number of training characters in Table 4.
For each model family, we fix the non-vocabulary parameters Nnv and vary the vocabulary size.
We adopt the Llama architecture [69], except for the vocabulary size. For the vocabulary size, we
use numbers divisible by 128 for compatibility with NVIDIA’s tensor core to accelerate matrix
multiplication 3. Specifically, the vocabulary sizes we adopt for each model family are 4096, 6144,
8192, 10240, 16384, 24576, 32768, 48128, 64512 and 96256. The expected number of training
tokens D and characters H vary slightly given a fixed number of non-vocabulary parameters and a
FLOP budget. We use the middle-sized V of 16384 to determine the number of training characters
and the corresponding FLOPs budget, except for Nnv = 2870M we use V = 32K.

A.7.2
The relationship between non-vocabulary parameters and embedding dimension

According to the observation in Kaplan et al. [30], the depth-width ratio has a relatively small effect
on performance given the total non-vocabulary parameters. Thus, to ease the modeling of our scaling
laws taking vocabulary size into account, we take the width (i.e. embedding dimension) as given
following prior work [30, 26, 44, 70, 84]. The relationship between the non-vocabulary parameters
Nnv and embedding dimension d used in our experiments are in Table 5.

A.7.3
Training details

The maximum learning rate is set to 4e-4 and decays to 10% i.e. 4e-5 similar to prior scaling
work [26, 44]. We use AdamW [37] as our optimizer and accelerate training with bfloat16 mixed

precision training. For models with Nnv < 1130M, we use a single node with 8 GPUs for training.
Otherwise, we adopt the Megatron-LM framework [60] for multi-node training with 8 GPUs on
each node. For our experiments with Nnv = 2870M, it takes about 120 hours to train on over 500B
training characters with 64 total GPUs. We use a global batch size of 512 for all runs and run all
experiments on 40GB Nvidia-A100 GPUs.

A.7.4
Fitting techniques

Approach 1
To avoid numerical underflow and overflow of the fitting parameters, we fit the data
in a logarithmic form inspired by Hoffmann et al. [26]. Taking Nnv as an example, we learn the
parameters k1, α1 by minimizing:

min
K1,α1 Huberδ(K1 + α1 log(C), log(Nnv)),
(11)

where K1 = log(k1) and Huberδ denotes the Huber loss with delta value δ (δ is 0.001 in our paper).
We use the LBFGS algorithm to find the local minima of the function. The later Approach 2 and 3
use the same optimization algorithm. We initialize all attributes from the same uniform grid where
K ∈[−20, 15] and α ∈[0, 1] with 20 initial guesses respectively. The fitting takes less than half of
one minute.

To cheaply obtain more experimental data points, we perform interpolation of (Nnv, Nv, H) triplets
in the logarithmic scale and predict the validation loss based on real data points. Then, we compute
the required FLOPs for each data point using Equation 5.

Approach 2
By using different Nnv and obtaining the corresponding optimal Nv based on
Equation 7, we have a set of {(Nnvi, Nvi)|i = 1, ..., n}.
Denoting Dnvi = Nnvi/Nnv0 and
Dvi = Nvi/Nv0, we learn the scaling proportion γ by minimizing:

min
γ
Huberδ(γ ∗log(Dnvi), log(Dvi)),
(12)

The initial guess of γ is uniformly sampled from [0, 1].

Approach 3
We recast the designed vocabulary-dependent loss formula here:

Lu = −E + A1

N α1
nv
+ A2

N α2
v
+
B
[Hf(V )]β ,
(13)

where β = α1. In practice, we try to minimize:

min
a1,a2,b,e,α1,α2 Huberδ( −exp(e) + exp(a1 −α1 ∗log(Nnv) + exp(a2 −α2 ∗log(Nv)

+ exp(b −β ∗log([Hf(V )])),
Lu),

22


---Page Break---
where A1 = exp(a1), A2 = exp(a2), B = exp(b), E = exp(e). We initialize all attributes from the
same uniform grid where a1 ∈[0, 5], a2 ∈[0, 5], b ∈[0, 5], e ∈[0, 2], α1 ∈[0, 1] and α2 ∈[0, 1]
with 3 initial guesses respectively. Given the prior that the scaling factor is typically ranged between
0 and 1 [26], we add a constraint 0.1 < α1, α2 < 1 during fitting. The fitting also takes less than half
of one minute.

A.8
Details of fitting tokens-character relationship function f(V )

We train 25 tokenizers with the following vocabulary sizes: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144,
7168, 8192, 9216, 10240, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 48128, 64512, 78848, 96256,
128000, 256000, 512000, 1024000. Then, we train the tokenizers on a uniformly sampled version of
the Slimpajama dataset.

Later, we apply the trained tokenizers on the validation set of the Slimpajama dataset and
collect the number of tokens D for each tokenizer with vocabulary size V .
We use
scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit the parameters a, b, c in f(V ) (§2.2).

A.9
Robustness of the tokens-characters relationship function f(V )

Robustness to the type of tokenizers
Besides the widely adopted BPE tokenizer used in our
experiment, we also consider the unigram tokenizer and the word-based tokenizer. We visualize their
tokens-characters ratio and corresponding predictive function in Figure 12. We find that our proposed
formula of f(V ) is a good predictor for the tokens-character ratio, regardless of which tokenizer
is used. This verifies the effectiveness of our proposed formula. The tokenization fertility of the
unigram tokenizer is close to that of the BPE tokenizer as seen in their similar y-axis values, since
they both employ subword-based tokenization. Meanwhile, the tokenization fertility of word-based
tokenization is poor, thus requiring more tokens on average to compress characters.

(a) BPE tokenizer
RMSE=3.8e-4, R2=0.99

(b) Unigram tokenizer
RMSE=5.2e-4, R2=0.98

(c) Word-based tokenizer
RMSE=3.6e-5, R2=0.99

Figure 12: The modeling of function f(V ) with different tokenizers. RMSE and R2 denote the
relative mean square error and coefficient of determination, respectively.

Robustness to the range of the vocabulary size
The quadratic function on the logarithmic
value of vocabulary size that we propose can precisely predict the tokens-characters ratio with an
RMSE of 1.5e-6 and R2 of 0.99. However, as a quadratic function is single-peaked, increasing
V will increase the output value of f(V ) = a log2(V ) + b log V + c when V is very large, e.g.
V > exp(−b/2a) ≈218K in our case.

Fortunately, when V is sufficiently large, the tokenization fertility improvement of the tokenizer
decays sharply, which results in almost no change to the value of f(V ). This is because the
words in the training corpus can already be effectively covered by the vocabulary list when the
vocabulary size is sufficiently large. In this extreme, the tokenization fertility of the corresponding
tokenizer is approaching saturation, thus further increasing the vocabulary size will hardly improve
the tokenization fertility.

As an example, there are about 2300M characters in the validation set of the Slimpajama corpus. A
tokenizer using a vocabulary size of 2K would yield 140M fewer tokens than a 1K counterpart,
but the number of tokens only decreases by 0.7M when going from a vocabulary size of 256K to

23


---Page Break---
257K. Therefore, we add min(V, 200K) before calculating f(V ) to ensure its decreasing nature.
According to our prediction, a model with 300B parameters has an optimal vocabulary size of no
more than 400K with a sufficient amount of training data. If we need to consider extremely large V
in the future, we can train tokenizers with larger V in the process of fitting f(V ) to arrive at more
precise predictions.

Experimental verification on the fairness of the unigram-normalized language modeling
loss

(a) Relationship between downstream task per-
formance and the commonly-used language
modeling loss.

(b) Relationship between downstream task per-
formance and the unigram-normalized language
modeling loss.

Figure 13: Empirical examination of the fairness of our unigram-normalized loss, Lu. Dots corre-
spond to trained models with varying vocabulary size. We plot their losses (y-axis) and performance
on 7 downstream tasks (x-axis): WG [56], PIQA [9], OBQA [42], Hellaswag [83], BoolQ [16],
ARC-E [17] and ARC-C [17]. The straight line reflects the results of the regression fit with the shade
indicating the confidence interval.

In §2.2, we have explained that we use a unigram-normalized loss, Lu, to fairly evaluate models
that vary in vocabulary size. Here we empirically verify this choice. We train models with a fixed
number of non-vocabulary parameters Nnv and embedding dimension d but varying vocabulary sizes
V . Thus, their vocabulary parameters Nv also vary. We plot the final language model loss and
unigram-normalized loss of these models compared to downstream performance in Figure 13. The
language modeling loss exhibits a positive correlation with downstream performance: Models with a
higher language modeling loss have better downstream performance. This is because our models
with larger vocabularies naturally have a higher loss due to the objective function, yet they can be
actually better models with better downstream performance. Our unigram-normalized loss solves this
problem and exhibits the expected negative correlation between loss and downstream performance:
a lower loss comes with better downstream performance. This empirically justifies our use of Lu
throughout this work.

A.11
Prediction for Llama3

While our primary experiments focus on the Llama2 vocabulary size, we also extend our conclusions
to Llama3, predicting its optimal vocabulary under optimal compute allocation. As shown in
Figure 14, we provide detailed predictions for various sizes of Llama3 models. Although Llama3
significantly increases its vocabulary size from 32K to 128K, our research suggests that this may still
be insufficient for the larger model sizes of 70B and 400B.

More Related Work

Vocabulary in language models
The vocabulary of a language model influences its performance
significantly [63, 75, 79]. A larger vocabulary size helps cover more words thus reducing the
likelihood of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) cases [21]. Takahashi and Tanaka-Ishii [63] find that larger

vocabularies are better at capturing the true statistical distribution of language. Similarly, expanding
vocabulary in multilingual models [75, 15, 85, 34] improves performance, especially for low-resource
languages. However, large vocabularies [31] increase the computational overhead during both
training and generation phases. For example, Liao et al. [35] demonstrate that low-frequency words
often lack sufficient examples to develop robust representations when vocabularies are excessively
large. Dou et al. [19] reveal that expanding vocabularies during continual pre-training can lead to
significant performance degradation for low-resource languages. More recently, Dagan et al. [18]
explored the trade-offs associated with vocabulary size, proposing optimal vocabulary sizes for both
memory efficiency and inference speed in code generation tasks. Our work complements these efforts
by focusing on the broader impact of vocabulary size on downstream performance across various
tasks. Specifically, we address a critical, under-explored question: How can we optimally allocate
vocabulary size to maximize the downstream performance with the same compute budget?

Byte-level language models
Recent work has explored byte-level language models [82, 77],
which offer advantages in decoding efficiency and noise robustness compared to token-level models.
However, typically limited to parameters under 1B, these models have not been effectively scaled up.
Our scaling laws suggest that the limited vocabulary (i.e., 256 in byte-level language models) may
constrain their performance, especially for larger models. The insight provides a potential explanation
for the challenges in scaling byte-level models and implies that successful scaling of language models
may require proportional increases in vocabulary size.

B
Limitation and future work

B.1
Limitations of our proposed approaches

Approach 1
The Approach 1 provides a broader solution by predicting the allocation of computa-
tional resources across non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary parameters, and training data based
on experimental data points. This method’s strength lies in its holistic view, allowing for a balanced
resource distribution that potentially enhances model efficiency and performance. However, this
approach is constrained by the granularity and range of the experimental data points available, which
can introduce errors in the fitting process. The requirement for substantial computational resources
to perform these fittings may also limit its accessibility and scalability. Despite these challenges,
when experimental data is ample and computational resources are sufficient, the Approach 1 can
significantly refine the precision of resource allocation decisions in the development of large-scale
language models.

25


---Page Break---
Approach 2
By calculating the derivative of FLOPs with respect to the vocabulary size and solving
for zero, this approach fundamentally relies on the precision of the FLOPs equation and our tokens-
characters relationship function. Further, this method does not allow us to independently determine
the optimal allocation of non-vocabulary parameters and training data size. Therefore, it necessitates
information about the relationships between these attributes and the FLOPs budget from the experi-
mentally fitted scaling laws, making this approach less useful in practice. Despite these limitations,
the derivative-based approach offers notable advantages, including closely matched predictions with
the scaling laws derived from actual experimental data in the Approach 2. Furthermore, its reliance
on numerical solutions rather than exhaustive deep learning experiments makes it rapid and broadly
applicable across various tokenizers, highlighting its utility in preliminary model configuration stages
where quick estimates are key.

Approach 3
Similar with the Approach 1, the proposed Approach 3 requires multiple experimental
runs across different non-vocabulary parameters, vocabulary sizes and number of training data.
Therefore, the approach is constrained by the granularity and range of the experimental data points
available to some extent. However, the proposed Approach 3 is flexible that it considers the fact
that the non-vocabulary parameters and the number of training data are not always following the
compute-optimal scaling laws [26], i.e., equal scaling, in real-world applications.

B.2
Larger models and different architectures

We have shown that our predictions hold for models with up to three billion parameters (§5). However,
LLMs are often orders of magnitude larger, such as the 400-billion parameter Llama-3 model [41].
Further, we have decided to focus on dense transformer language models, as they are most commonly
used for LLMs. However, many non-transformer models have been proposed and scaled up to billions
of parameters [49, 50]. Exploring to what extent our findings hold in even larger models and with
different architectures is a promising direction for future work.

B.3
Parametric function for the loss when considering the vocabulary

Researchers [26, 44] consider modeling the language modeling loss with parametric functions in
the form of L = P1 + P2/N α + P3/Dβ, where {P1, P2, P3, α, β} are learnable variables. The first
term of loss represents the minimum achievable loss, and the second and third terms represent the
contribution to the loss from the model size N and number of training tokens D. The parametric
function allows predicting the loss L given N and D even if (N,D) are not optimally allocated.
In prior work, this loss formula accounts for changes in model size and training data but does not
explicitly address the complexities introduced by varying vocabulary sizes. Incorporating vocabulary
size into the loss predictor is challenging: Vocabulary size affects the model directly as well as
the number of training tokens and the quality of tokenization by the tokenizer. A tokenizer with a
large vocabulary size makes it easier to capture semantic information in raw text and reduces the
frequency of out-of-vocabulary words. For instance, a large vocabulary size may cover common
phrases, common subwords, and specialized terminology. Therefore, even if the same number of
tokens are trained, the performance of the model trained on tokens with different qualities will be
different.

Future work in this area could explore various parametric non-linear loss functions to predict the
interactions between vocabulary size, model size, and training data with different compute allocations,
not just the case of optimal compute allocation. Additionally, empirical studies on different datasets
could help in understanding how vocabulary size impacts loss under varied data conditions, guiding
the development of more adaptive loss prediction models.

B.4
Extensions to multilingual and multimodal scenarios

Future work could extend the proposed approaches to encompass multilingual and multimodal
scenarios. Multilingual models require a nuanced understanding of vocabulary due to linguistic
diversity, which may affect the optimal vocabulary size and the computation of FLOPs differently
across languages. Adapting these methods to consider linguistic features and tokenization variations
could lead to more tailored and efficient resource allocations for multilingual models. Different
languages compete with each other for the model’s ability to allocate to that language [10], which

26


---Page Break---
makes it necessary to take into account the relationship between different languages when setting the
size of word lists for different languages in a multilingual scenario.

For multimodal models that integrate text with other data types such as images or video, the optimal
vocabulary size might interact uniquely with non-linguistic parameters. Recent work [1, 68] models
visual concepts in an autoregressive manner with tokenization like the processing of text data. It is
interesting to explore the size of visual vocabulary size, i.e., the codebook size [22], in the visual
tasks and vision-language tasks. How to set the vocabulary size and the compute resource efficiently
for different modalities remains an open issue.

C
Potential social impact

The positive potential social impact of this research on vocabulary size in language model scaling
is substantial. By optimizing large language models with the consideration of the vocabulary size
and other attributes jointly, the paper provides a foundational understanding that can lead to more
lightweight and cost-effective pre-trained large language models. This efficiency can democratize
access to advanced language processing technologies, making it feasible for smaller organizations
and the general public to benefit from powerful AI tools. Such advancements can benefit various
domains, for example, improve accessibility features for individuals with disabilities, where efficient
language models can be used to analyze medical records and assist in diagnostics. Furthermore, the
reduction in computational requirements for training these models can lead to a decrease in energy
usage, contributing positively to environmental sustainability efforts.

On the other hand, the misuse of pretrained language models may pose risks, including the creation of
highly realistic deepfakes that can spread disinformation and undermine trust in media and institutions.
These models can generate misleading content, automate cyberattacks through convincing phishing
schemes, and produce large-scale spam, degrading online communication. Additionally, they can be
used to generate harmful or abusive content, such as hate speech, which perpetuates discrimination
and harms vulnerable populations. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to develop trustworthy
language models, implement robust monitoring systems, and foster collaboration among researchers,
policymakers, and users.

---Page Break---
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the supplemental material.

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see §4 and §A.7.3.

Guidelines:

material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide standard deviation for downstream performance in Table 3 and
confidence intervals for our experiments in §A.10. For our pre-training experiments, we
do not provide error bars due to their computational cost. Specifically, our variables are
“The number of considered models” × “The number of considered vocabulary size” ×
“The number of training characters” × “The number of repeated experiments”. Training
multiple models across all these axes for more statistical significance would be prohibitively
expensive.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

31


---Page Break---
Justification: Please see Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see §4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets are introduced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

32


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing experiments and research are involved.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No participants are involved.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
