Abstract

Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or
stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial
intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language compre-
hension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods
of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow
iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly,
the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming
from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of
cognition, we propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), a novel sequence mem-
ory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model
that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input only
once. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely
representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which
prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM
generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities;
this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the
predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian
plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g.,
noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout
the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward
in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential
memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intel-
ligence research. Illustration videos and code are available on our project page:

Introduction

Modeling the temporal associations between consecutive inputs in a sequence (i.e., sequential
memory) enables biological agents to perform various cognitive functions, such as episodic memory
formation [53, 64, 15], complex action planning [22] and translating between languages [3]. For
example, playing a musical instrument requires remembering the sequence of notes in a piece of
music; similarly, playing a game of chess requires simulating, planning, and executing a sequence of
moves in a specific order. While the ability to form such memories of static, unrelated events has
been extensively studied [56, 55, 63, 69, 66], the ability of biologically-plausible artificial networks
to learn and recall temporally-dependent patterns has not been sufficiently explored in literature [62].
The task of sequential memory is considered challenging for models operating under biological
constraints (i.e., local synaptic computations) for many reasons, including catastrophic forgetting,
ambiguous context representations, multiple future possibilities, etc.

In addition to the biological constraint, we impose the following set of desirable characteristics as
learning constraints on sequence memory models.

• The learning of one sequence does not overwrite the previously learned sequences. This prop-
erty is defined under the continual learning framework as avoiding catastrophic forgetting
and evaluated with the Backward Transfer (BWT) metric [38].

• The model should uniquely encode inputs based on their context in a sequence. Consider
the sequence of letters “EVER”; the representation of “E” at position 1 should be different
from “E” at position 3, thus resulting in different predictions: “V” and “R”. Moreover, the
representation of “E” at position 3 in “EVER” should be different from “E” at position 3 in
“CLEVER”. Therefore, positional encoding is not a valid solution.

• When presented with multiple valid, future possibilities, the model should learn to represent
each possibility separately yet stochastically sample a single valid possibility. Consider the
two sequences “THAT” and “THEY”; after seeing “TH”, the model should learn to generate
either “A” or “E”, but not an average [37] or a union of both [25].

• The model should be capable of incrementally learning each transition without seeing the
whole sequence or revisiting older sequence transitions that are previously learned. This
property falls under online learning constraints, also called stream learning [45, 25].

• The learning algorithm should be tolerant and robust to significant input noise. A model
should continuously clean the noisy inputs using learned priors and beliefs, thus performing
future predictions based on the noise-free observations [25].

We propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), which consists of a state prediction model and a
generative attractor model. The predictor in PAM is inspired by the Hierarchical Temporal Memory
(HTM) [25] learning algorithm, where a group of neurons in the same cortical minicolumn share
the same receptive feedforward connection from the sensory input on their proximal dendrites. The
depolarization of the voltage of any neuron in a single minicolumn (i.e., on distal dendrites) primes
this depolarized neuron to fire first while inhibiting all the other neurons in the same minicolumn
from firing (i.e., competitive learning). The choice of which neurons fire within the same minicolumn
is based on the previously active neurons and their trainable synaptic weights to the depolarized
neurons, which gives rise to a unique context representation for every input [20]. The sparsity
of representations (discussed later in Section 3.2) allows for multiple possible predictions to be
represented as a union of individual cell assemblies. The Attractor Model learns to disentangle
possibilities by strengthening the synaptic weights between active neurons of input representations
and inhibiting the other predicted possibilities from firing, effectively forming fixed point attractors
during online learning. During recall, the model uses these learned conditional attractors to sample
one of the valid predicted possibilities or uses the attractors as prior beliefs for removing noise from
sensory observations.

PAM satisfies the above-listed constraints for a sequential memory model, whereas the current
state-of-the-art models fail in all or many of the constraints, as shown in the experiments. Our
contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) Present the novel PAM learning algorithm that can
explicitly represent context in memory without backpropagation, avoid catastrophic forgetting, and
perform stochastic generation of multiple future possibilities. (2) Perform extensive evaluation of
PAM on multiple tasks (e.g., sequence capacity, sequence generation, catastrophic forgetting, noise
robustness, etc.) and different data types (e.g., protein sequences, text, vision). (3) Formulate PAM
and its learning rules as a State Space Model grounded in variational inference and the Free Energy
Principle [17].

Background and Related Works

2.1
Predictive Coding

Predictive coding proposes a framework for the hierarchical processing of information. It was initially
formulated as a time series compression algorithm to create a more efficient coding system [16, 46].
A few decades later, PC was used to model visual processing in the Retina [59, 27] as an inference
model. In the seminal work of Rao and Ballard [52], PC was reformulated as a general computational
model of the cortex. The main intuition is that the brain continuously predicts all perceptual inputs,
resulting in a quantity of prediction error, which can be minimized by adjusting its neural activities
and synaptic strengths. In-depth variational free energy derivation is provided in Appendix A.1.

PC defines two subgroups of neurons: value z and error. Each neuron contains a value node
sending its prediction to the lower level ˆzl = fl+1(zl+1) through learnable function f, and error
node propagating its computed error to the higher level. The total prediction error is computed as
ϵ = P

l ||(zl −ˆzl)||2
2, which is minimized by first running the network value nodes to equilibrium
through optimizing the value nodes {zl}L
l=0. At equilibrium, the value nodes are fixed, and inferential
optimization is performed by optimizing the functions {fl}L
l=1. Both optimizations aim to minimize
the same prediction error over all neurons. This propagation of error to equilibrium is shown to
be equivalent to backpropagation but using only local computations [66]. The PC formulation has
shown success in training on static and i.i.d data [66, 69, 57, 23]. More recently [62], Temporal
Predictive Coding (tPC) has also shown some success in sequential memory tasks by modifying error
formulation to account for a one-step synaptic delay through interneurons, thus modeling temporal
associations between sequence inputs. In the experiments, we compare our model to tPC and its
2-layer variant [62]. A few PC-based models [47, 48] have shown promise for class-incremental
continual learning tasks, other PC-inspired models, such as [39, 23, 24], have diverged from the
biologically plausible constraints by training through backpropagation through time.

2.2
Fixed-Point Attractor Dynamics

Attractor dynamics refer to mathematical models that describe the behavior of dynamical systems.
In our review, we focus on fixed point attractors, specifically Hopfield Networks [26] (HN), which
is an instance of associative memory models [32, 29, 30]. Consider, an ordered sequence of T + 1
consecutive patterns x = [xt]T +1
t=1 , where xt ∈{−1, 1}N. We refer to the Universal Hopfield
Networks (UHN) framework [41] to describe all variants of HN architecture using a similarity (sim)
function and a separation (sep) function, as shown in equation 1. This family of models can be viewed
as a memory recall function, where a query ξ (i.e., noisy or incomplete pattern) is compared to the
existing patterns to compute similarity scores using the “sim” function. These scores are then used
to weight the projection patterns after applying a “sep” function to increase the separation between
similarity scores. The classical HN uses symmetric weights to store the patterns; therefore, it cannot
be used to model temporal associations in a sequence. The asymmetric Hopfield Network (AHN) [58]
uses asymmetric weights to recall the next pattern in the sequence for a given query ξ.

When a dot product “sim” function and identity “sep” function are used, we get the classical HN [26]
and AHN [58]. A few variants have been proposed to increase the capacity of the model. Recently,
[12] has extended AHN by using a polynomial (with degree d) or a softmax function (with temperature
β) as the “sep” function. HN can also be applied to continuous dense patterns [34, 51, 12], and
extended to sparse modern Hopfield models [28, 67].

2.3
Predictive Learning

Predictive learning takes a more general form of minimizing the prediction error between two
views of the same input to improve representations. Many backpropagation-based approaches to
predictive learning have been proposed; most recently, JEPA [37] and its variants [8, 10, 9, 70],
learn useful dense representations from images and videos using the predictive objective. Other
models, such as [11, 21, 13] - to list a few, use a similar methodology of predicting distorted versions
of the same input to learn good feature representations. Prediction-based approaches have also
been used to segment videos into events temporally [2, 42] and spatially [44, 43, 1]. More recently,
STREAMER [45] used a predictive learning approach to achieve hierarchical segmentation and
representation learning from streaming egocentric videos, where a high prediction error is used as an
event boundary. While these biologically implausible approaches show impressive results on their
respective tasks, they still suffer from deep learning known limitations, such as catastrophic forgetting
and the inability to generate multiple possibilities in regression-based predictive tasks. Hierarchical
Temporal Memory (HTM) [25] is a predictive approach that is heavily inspired by neurobiology.
HTM relies on lateral inhibition between neurons of the same minicolumn and sparsity of input
representations (i.e., SDR) to learn temporal context and associations using only local Hebbian rules.

HTM can be applied to online tasks, such as anomaly detection [6] and object recognition [36], but it
is currently incapable of generating future predictions in auto-regressive prediction tasks.

Mixture of Gaussian model representing the conditional probability of multiple possibilities p(x|z)

PAM can be represented as a dynamical system with its structure depicted by a Bayesian probabilistic
graphical [35, 31] model, more specifically, a State Space Model, where we can perform Bayesian
inference on the latent variables and derive learning rules using Variational Inference. Formally,
we define a state space model as a tuple (Z, X, f, g), where Z is the latent state space, X is the
observation space, and f and g are the transition and emission functions respectively (similar to
HMM [50]). We consider a Gaussian form with white Gaussian noise covariance Σz for the latent
states. However, we assume a latent state z can generate multiple valid possibilities. Therefore, we
model the conditional probability p(xt|zt) as a Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where
each mode is considered a possibility or a fixed-point attractor in an associative memory model. The
GMM has C components with means gc(zt), covariances Σc and component weights wc. The SSM
dynamics can be formally represented with the following equations:

zt|zt−1 ∼N(f(zt−1), Σz),
and
xt|zt ∼

C
X

c=1
wc · N(gc(zt), Σc) ,
(2)

where zt ∈Z and xt ∈X. From the Bayesian inference viewpoint, we are interested in the posterior
p(zt|xt, zt−1). Since the functions f and g are non-linear, the computation of this posterior is in-
tractable (unlike an LG-SSM, such as Kalman Filter [65]). Therefore, we utilize variational inference
to approximate the posterior by assuming the surrogate posterior q(z) has a Gaussian form, and mini-
mize the Variational Free Energy (VFE) [18]. The minimization of VFE (in equation 3) minimizes
the KL-divergence between the approximate posterior q(z) and the true posterior p(zt|xt, zt−1).

terms (i.e., Latent State Accuracy and Observation Accuracy) to prediction errors. This learning
objective encourages the approximate posterior q(z) to assign a high probability to states that explain
the observations well and follow the latent dynamics of the system. We minimize the prediction errors
(i.e., learn the transition and emission functions) through Hebbian rules as shown in equations 7 and 8.

Theorem 1 Assume the likelihood p(xt|zt) in eqn 3 represents multiple possibilities using a Gaus-
sian Mixture Model (GMM) conditioned on the latent state zt, as shown in eqn 2. The maximization
of such log-likelihood function (i.e.,
∂
∂x log p(xt|zt)) w.r.t a query observation state x is equivalent
to the Hopfield recall function (i.e., eqn 1) with the means of the GMM representing the attractors
of a Hopfield model. Formally, the weighted average of the GMM means (i.e., {µc}C
c=1), with the
weights being a similarity measure, maximizes the log-likelihood of x under the mixture model.

Preliminaries and Notations

Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR)
Inspired by the sparse coding principles observed in
the brain, SDRs encode information using a small set of active neurons in high dimensional binary
representation. We adopt SDRs as a more biologically plausible cell assembly representation [30].
SDRs have desirable characteristics, such as a low chance of false positives and collisions between
multiple SDRs and high representational capacity [5] (More on SDRs in Appendix G). An SDR is
parameterized by the total number of neurons N and the number of active neurons W. The ratio
S = W/N denotes the SDR sparsity. A 1-dimensional SDR x can be indexed as xi ∈{0, 1},
whereas a 2-dimensional SDR z can be indexed as zij ∈{0, 1}. To identify the active neurons, we
define the function I : {0, 1}N 7→NW to represent the indices of the active neurons in an SDR x as
I(x) = {i|xi = 1}.

Context as Orthogonal Dimension
We transform the high-order Markov dependencies between
observation states into a first-order Markov chain of latent states by storing context information in
those latent states. The latent states SDRs, z ∈{0, 1}Nc×Nk, are represented with two orthogonal
dimensions, where content information about the input is stored in one dimension with size Nc,
while context related information is stored in an orthogonal dimension with size Nk. Therefore,
the projection of the latent state z on the first dimension (i.e., ↓z) removes all context information
from the state. In contrast, adding context information to an observation state x expands the
dimensionality of the state (i.e., ↑x) such that context can be encoded without affecting its content.
Competitive learning is enforced on the context dimension through lateral inhibition, effectively
minimizing the collisions between contexts of multiple SDRs. We define a projection operator ↓:
{0, 1}Nc×Nk 7→{0, 1}Nc. Additionally, we define a projection operator ↑: {0, 1}Nc 7→{0, 1}Nc×Nk
for 1-dimensional SDRs (i.e., x) as shown in equation 5. A detailed list of notations is provided in
the supplementary material (Table 1).

3.3
Sequence Learning

Given a sequence of T + 1 SDR patterns [xt]T +1
t=1 , where xt ∈{0, 1}Nc, the sequence can be learned
by modeling the context-dependent transitions between consecutive inputs within the sequence. We
define learnable weight parameters for transition and emission functions, A ∈RNcNk×NcNk, B ∈
RNc×Nc respectively. A single latent state transition is defined as ˆzt = δ(A · zt−1) = δ(at), where
δ is a threshold function transforming the logits at to the predicted SDR state ˆzt. The full sequence
learning algorithm is provided in algorithm 1.

Context Encoding through Competitive Learning
Every observation xt contains only content
information about the input; we embed the observation with context by expanding the state with an
orthogonal dimension (i.e., ↑xt), which activates all neurons in the minicolumns at the indices I(xt).
Then, for each active minicolumn, the neuron in a predictive state (i.e., higher than the prediction
threshold) fires and inhibits all the other neurons in the same minicolumn from firing (i.e., lateral
inhibition), as shown in Equation 6. If none - or more than one - of the neurons are in a predictive
state, random Gaussian noise (ϵ) acts as a tiebreaker to select a context neuron. We do not allow
multiple neurons to fire in the same minicolumn, which is different from HTM [25], where multiple
cells can fire in any minicolumn (e.g., bursting).

State Transition Learning
The transition between latent states is learned through local computa-
tions with Hebbian-based rules. We modify the synaptic weights A to model the transition between
pre-synaptic neurons zt−1 and post-synaptic neurons zt. Only the synapses with active pre-synaptic
neurons are modified. The weights operate on context-dependant latent states (i.e., zt−1 →zt); thus,
the learning of one transition does not overwrite previously learned transition of different contexts,
regardless of the input contents (i.e., xt−1). We use the learning constant coefficients η+
A and η−
A
to independently control learning and forgetting behavior, as shown in equation 7. A lower η−

Contrastive Attractors Formation
The attractors are formed in an online manner by contrasting

synapses between active neurons of xt, and bidirectional inhibitory synapses between xt and the
union set of predicted possibilities excluding the xt possibility (i.e., (↓ˆzt) \ xt)), as shown in
equation 8.

version of the sequence is provided as input, and the model is expected to generate the original
learned sequence. In offline sequence generation, the model is only provided with the first input,
and it is expected to generate the entire sequence auto-regressively. For cases with equally valid
future predictions (e.g., “a” and “e” after “TH” in “THAT” and “THEY”), the model is expected
to stochastically generate either one of the possibilities (i.e., “THAT” or “THEY”). The online
generation task is a more challenging extension of the online recall task in [62], where the noise-free
inputs are provided, and the model only makes a 1-step prediction into the future. During offline
sequence generation, the model randomly samples from the union set of predictions ↓ˆz a single SDR
with W active neurons (equation 9) to initialize the iterative attractor procedure. π denotes a random
permutation function. This random permutation function allows the model to randomly generate a
different sequence with every generation.

Experiments

4.1
Evaluation and Metrics

Metrics
To evaluate the similarity of two SDRs, we use the Jaccard Index (i.e., IoU)1, which
focuses on the active bits in sparse binary representations. Since the sparsity S of the representations
can change across experiments and methods, we normalize the IoU by the expected IoU (Derived
in Theorem 2 in Appendix A.3) of two random SDRs at their specified sparsities. The normalized
IoU is computed as IoU−E[IoU]

1−E[IoU] . We use the Backward Transfer [38] metric in evaluating catastrophic
forgetting. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to compare images for vision datasets.

Datasets
We perform evaluations on synthetic and real datasets. The synthetic datasets allow us to
manually control variables (e.g., sequence length, correlation, noise, input size) to better understand
the models’ behavior across various settings. Additionally, we evaluate on real datasets of various
types (e.g., protein sequences, text, vision) to benchmark PAM’s performance relative to other models
on more challenging and real sequences. For all vision experiments, we use an SDR autoencoder to
learn a mapping between images and SDRs (Details on the autoencoder are provided in Appendix C).
We run all experiments for 10 different seeds and report the mean and standard deviation in all the
figures. More experimental details and results are provided in Appendices C and E.

1In the context of SDRs, IoU refers to the number of active bits in the intersection SDR divided by the
number of active bits in the union SDR

Results

We align our evaluation tasks with the desired characteristics of a biologically plausible sequence
memory model, as listed in the introduction. We show that PAM outperforms current predictive
coding and associative memory SoTA approaches on all tasks. Most importantly, PAM is capable
of long context encoding, multiple possibilities generation, and learning continually and efficiently
while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. These tasks pose numerous significant challenges to other
methods.

Offline Sequence Capacity
We evaluate the models’ capacity to learn long sequences by varying
the input size Nc, model parameters (e.g., Nk), and sequence correlation. The correlation is increased
by reducing the number of unique patterns (i.e., vocab) used to create a sequence of length T.
Correlation is computed as 1.0 −vocab

T . In Figure 3 A, we vary the input size Nc and ablate the
models to find the maximum sequence length to be encoded and retrieved, in an offline manner, with a
Normalized IoU higher than 0.9. We set the number of active bits W to be 5 unless otherwise specified.
Results show that Hopfield Networks (HN) fail to learn with sparse representations; therefore, we use
W of 0.5Nc only for HN and normalize the IoU metric accordingly. PAM’s capacity significantly
increases with context neurons Nk, as expected. HN’s capacity also increases with the polynomial
degree d of its separation function; however, as shown in Figure 3 B, the capacity sharply drops as
correlation increases. PAM retains its capacity with increasing correlation, reflecting its ability to
encode context in long sequences (i.e., high-order Markov memory). This context encoding property
is also demonstrated in the qualitative CIFAR [33] results in Figure 3 E and F, where a short sequence
of images with high correlation is used. The model must uniquely encode the context to correctly
predict at every step in the sequence. While PAM correctly predicts the full context, single-layer tPC
learns to indefinitely alternate between the patterns, while two-layered tPC attempts to average its
predictions. AHN shows similar low performance and failure mode as in [62].

Catastrophic Forgetting
To assess the model’s performance in a continual learning setup, we
sequentially train each model on multiple sequences and compute the Backward Transfer (BWT) [38]

one. In Figure 4 A, we report BWT for 50 synthetically generated sequences with varying correlations.
AHN can avoid catastrophic forgetting when the patterns are not correlated, whereas tPC fails to retain
previous knowledge regardless of the correlation value. PAM, with high enough context Nk, does not
overwrite or forget previously learned sequences after learning new ones but performs poorly when
Nk = 1, as expected. We repeat the experiment on more challenging sequences from ProteinNet [7],
which contains highly correlated (> 0.9) and long sequences (details in appendix). The results in
Figure 4 B show a similar trend with PAM requiring more context neurons Nk to handle the more
challenging data. Qualitative results on moving-MNIST [60] in Figure 4 F further demonstrate the
catastrophic forgetting challenge where the learning of the second sequence overwrites the learned
sequence. PAM successfully retrieves the previously learned sequence while the other models fail.

Multiple Possibilities Generation
In addition to accurately encoding input contexts, PAM is
designed to represent multiple valid possibilities and sample a single possibility. We perform
evaluation on a dataset of four-letter English words (details in appendix), which includes many
possible future completions (e.g., “th[is]”, “th[at]”, “th[em]”, etc.) We train PAM on the list of letters
sequentially (i.e., one word at a time); the other methods are trained in a simpler batched setup as
in [62] because they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. This puts PAM at a disadvantage, but as
shown in Figure 4 C, PAM still significantly outperforms the other methods in accurately generating
valid words (high average IoU) in an offline manner. Both tPC and AHN fail to generate meaningful
words when trained on sequences with multiple future possibilities. Figure 4 D further demonstrates
the stochastic generative property of PAM. We show PAM’s ability to recall more of the dataset as it
repeats the generation process, whereas PC and AHN fail in the dataset recall task.

Online Noise Robustness
The online generation ability of PAM shown in Figure 2 allows the
model to use the learned attractors to clean the noisy observations before using them as inputs to the
predictor. This step allows the model to use its prior belief about future observations to modify the
noisy inputs. In Figure 3 C, we evaluate the models’ performances by changing a percentage of the
active bits during online generation. PAM is able to completely replace the noisy input with its prior
belief if it does not exist in the predicted set of possibilities ˆz. In contrast, the other methods use the
noisy inputs, thus hindering their performances. We provide qualitative results on CLEVRER [68]

in Figure 4 E; PAM retrieves the original sequence despite getting noisy inputs (40% noise), and
outperforms the other models. Interestingly, tPC performs reasonably well on this task despite the
added noise.

Efficiency
We report, in Figure 3 D, the time each model requires to learn and recall a sequence.
For this study, we use input size Nc = 100 and vary the sequence length. PAM operates entirely
on CPU. The results show that a single-layer tPC model requires more time than all PAM variants
(Nk ≤24). Additionally, a two-layered tPC requires two to three orders of magnitude more time
than PAM or single-layered tPC, significantly limiting its scalability and practicality when applied to
real data with long sequences.

Limitations

PAM requires that its representations be sparse and binary (i.e., SDRs) in order to represent multiple
possibilities as a union of SDRs with minimal overlap. Therefore, PAM cannot be directly applied
to images in the input space like Dense Hopfield Networks. We argue that the neocortex encodes
sensory input into SDRs for processing and does not operate directly on the input in its dense
representation. Methods that operate directly on dense representations (e.g., images) are arguably less
biologically plausible as the neocortex uses sparse binary representations (i.e., cell assemblies with a
small fraction of firing neurons) to store and manipulate information. This paper focuses on learning
multiple sequences without catastrophic forgetting and stochastically generating multiple possibilities
efficiently, and we assume the sequence is provided in SDR format. Additionally, methods that
operate on the input directly face challenges when the input is naturally sparse (see Figure 3 A).
Therefore, it is useful to encode the input into a representation with fixed sparsity before applying
sequential memory learning algorithms. In future work, we plan to investigate how to encode high
dimensional complex inputs (e.g., images) in a compositional part-whole structure of SDRs where
we can apply PAM at different levels of abstraction.

Conclusion

We proposed PAM, a biologically plausible generative model inspired by neuroscience findings
and theories of cognition. We demonstrate that PAM is capable of encoding unique contexts with
tremendous scalable capacity that is not affected by sequence correlation or noise. PAM is a generative
model; it can represent multiple possibilities as a union of SDRs (a property of sparsity) and sample
single possibilities, thus predicting multiple steps in the future despite multiple possible continuations.
We also show that PAM does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting as it learns multiple sequences.
PAM is trained using local computations through Hebbian rules and runs efficiently on CPUs. Future
directions include hierarchical sensory processing and higher-order sparse predictive models.

Theorems and Derivations

A.1
Variational Free Energy

Predictive Coding
Consider a hierarchical generative model with hidden states {z}L
l=0, where
l ≤L denotes the level in the hierarchy. The conditional probability p(zl|zl+1) is assumed to be
a multivariate Gaussian distribution with its mean calculated as a function fl+1 of the higher-level
hidden representation zl+1 and covariance Σl as shown in equation 10.

p(zl|zl+1) = N(fl+1(zl+1), Σl)
(10)

The goal is to calculate the posterior of hidden states given an observation x, (i.e., P({z}L
l=0|x)).
Since the prediction function f contains a non-linear activation, we cannot analytically compute the
posterior and we have to approximate it with a surrogate posterior (i.e., q({z}L
l=0) by maximizing
the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). We apply the mean field approximation to factorize this joint
posterior probability into conditionally independent posteriors {q(zl)}L
l=0}, and apply the Laplace
approximation to use Gaussian forms for the approximate distribution [19, 18, 54]. Through these
approximations, we can maximize the ELBO, or equivalently minimize the Variational Free Energy,
in equation 11.

Accuracy

(11)

The variational free energy can be reduced to minimizing the negative log-likelihood (Accuracy
term), which is simply the prediction error when the likelihood is assumed to take a Gaussian Form.
Therefore, minimizing the prediction error reduces to the sum of the squared prediction error of every
neuron.

Derivation 1 Variational Free Energy derivation for the predictive coding objective function in
equation 11. We approximate the true posterior p(z|x) with a surrogate posterior q(z). The
objective is to minimize the reverse KL divergence DKL(q(z)||p(z|x)).

DKL(q(z)||p(z|x)) = Ez∼q(z)[log q(z)

(Evidence does not depend on q(x))

To minimize the KL divergence, we can minimize the Variational Free energy instead because the
Evidence term (log p(x)) is a constant negative term. The Variational Free Energy can be further
simplified as follows:

We arrive at equation 11. Minimizing the error term (i.e., negative log-likelihood) is equivalent to
minimizing the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) when a Gaussian form is assumed for the likelihood
p(x|z).

Derivation 2 Variational Free Energy derivation for a State Space Model (SSM) in equation 3.
Latent states are denoted with z, whereas observations are denoted with x. We assume non-linear
transition and emission function (i.e., f and g); therefore a variational approximation is needed to
approximate the true posterior p(zt|zt−1, xt) with a surrogate posterior q(zt). As in derivation 1,
the goal is to minimize the divergence between the true posterior and the approximate posterior (i.e.,
DKL(q(zt)||p(zt|zt−1, xt))). Note that, for notation brevity, Eq ≡Ez∼q(zt).

DKL(q(zt)||p(zt|zt−1, xt)) = Eq[log

We can minimize the Variational Free Energy term, which reduces to the log-likelihood of two

A.2
Gaussian Mixture Model and Hopfield Recall

Derivation 3 We derive theorem 1 which states that the maximization of the log-likelihood of p(xt|zt)
in the form of a Gaussian Mixture Model is equivalent to the recall function in Hopfield networks (i.e.,
eqn 1), where the means of the GMM (i.e., {µc}C
c=1) represents the attractors of a Hopfield model.
To maximize the log-likelihood, we compute its partial derivative with respect to x.

By setting the partial derivative of the log-likelihood to 0, we can estimate the value of x, which
maximizes the function log p(x|z).

Finally, we can rearrange the equation in terms of x and show that it is equivalent to the Hopfield
recall function where the recall value x equals a weighted average of the attractors (i.e., means of
GMM {µc}C
c=1), with the weights being a similarity score function.

Expected IoU of Random SDRs

Theorem 2 Consider two SDRs with sparsity defined as random variables p ∼U(0, 1) and q ∼
U(0, 1), the expected Jaccard Index (i.e., IoU) of the two random SDRs follows:
pq
p + q −pq

Proof:
Given the sparsity random variables of both SDRs (i.e., p and q) and the SDR size n, the
number of active bits at the same location in both SDRs is equal to the joint probability of both SDRs
being active multiplied by the SDR size (i.e., npq). The union of both SDRs is the total number
of active bits minus the active bits in both SDRs, which is equal to np + nq −npq. Therefore, the
expected intersection over union is
npq
np+nq−npq =

Figure 5: Empirical Validation of Theorem 2

Empirical Validation:
We perform empirical validation of the above theorem as shown in figure 5.
The sparsity of the first SDR is fixed at 0.1 and 0.5. We vary the sparsity of the second SDR between
0.0 and 1.0 in steps of 0.1 and calculate the average IoU over a population of 1000 pairs of SDR for
every setting. Empirical results agree with the derived formulation in theorem 2.

B
Notations

The notations used in our paper are summarized in Table 1.

C
Datasets

Synthetic
For synthetic experiments, we generate SDRs with the specified size Nc and uniformly
initialized active bits W to match the required sparsity S. In many of the experiments, Nc is set to
100 with 5 active bits unless otherwise specified. For Hopfield experiments, we set the sparsity to
50% to improve its performance.

Protein Sequences
We use the dataset ProteinNet 7 [7] to extract protein sequences. Each sequence
consists of a chain of Amino Acids. In the dataset, there are only 20 different types of Amino Acids
(i.e., vocabulary), creating long protein sequences with hundreds of Amino Acids. The dataset is
reported in the fasta format, where each Amino Acid is represented with a single-letter code. We
create a dictionary mapping from the Amino Acid types to random SDRs with Nc = 100 and W = 5
to train the models. When choosing the sequences, we ensure that the starting Amino Acid is unique
for all the dataset sequences to avoid ambiguous predictions in the continual learning evaluation. A
sample of the protein sequence is provided below:

To evaluate the generative ability of PAM, we use a dataset of the most frequently used

a mapping dictionary from all the unique letters in the dataset to random SDRs with Nc = 100 and

Vision
In our experiment, we evaluate on sequences extracted from Moving MNIST [60],
CLEVRER [68] as well as synthetically generated sequences of CIFAR [33] images. In order
to convert images to SDRs and SDRs back to images while encoding semantics into the SDRs, we
design an SDR AutoEncoder. The goal is to force the bottleneck representation of the autoencoder
to become a sparse binary representation, where two visually similar images would result in two
SDRs with a high overlap of active neurons. We simply design a CNN autoencoder with a 3-layer
CNN encoder and 3-layer CNN decoder and apply top K binarization operation on the bottleneck
embedding during training. The full architecture of the SDR autoencoder is shown in Figure 6.

In practice, we use a weighted average of the SDR and Dense representation to allow gradients of the
reconstruction loss to freely propagate into the encoder. The weight of the SDR (i.e., α) is gradually
and linearly increased (from 0.0 to 1.0) with the number of training epochs. This gradual increase is
fundamental to the training of the SDR Autoencoder as it smooths the loss landscape and allows the
model to distribute the active bits on the full SDR. The total mse loss becomes Lenc +Lrecon. We use
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1×10−4. For Moving MNIST, we use a bottleneck embedding

Implementation Details

In this section, we describe the implementation details and hyperparameters of each method. For
each model, we optimize a single set of hyperparameters for all the experiments.

PAM
The neurons in both, transition and emission, functions are fully connected. We do not
assume any of the weight matrices are symmetric. All synaptic weights are initialized by sampling
from a normal distribution with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 0.1. All η+ values in
Equations 7 & 8 are set to 0.1. η−
B is set to −0.1, while η−
A is set to 0.0 to avoid forgetting previous
possibilities when learning new transitions; PAM learns a union of possibilities. The threshold for the
δ function is set as a function of the SDR sparsity. For the transition function, we use a threshold of
0.8W, where W is the active number of bits in the latent state (z) SDR. For the emission function,
we use a threshold of 0.1W, where W is the active number of bits in the observation state (x) SDR.
During offline generation we sample an initial ˜x from ↓ˆz with W = 1 active neurons. During
generation, we set the maximum number of attractor iterations to 100 but stop iterating when the
energy of the state converges to a local minimum. During sequence learning, we update A and B
iteratively until the transition is learned before learning the next transition. This iterative weight
update makes the model insensitive to the hyperparameter values η. Both A and B are always
clamped in the range [−1, 1]. The states z are flattened into a single dimension before applying the
learning rule in Equation 7. Binary representations (i.e., {0, 1}) are used as inputs.

Temporal Predictive Coding
For the tPC architecture, we use learning rate of 1e-4 for 800
learning iterations. When a 2-layer tPC model is used, the inference learning rate is set to 1e-2 for
400 inference iterations. Also, the hidden size is set to twice the input size. We found that these
parameters work best for all of the experiments and allow the model to fully converge. Bipolar
representations (i.e., {-1, 1}) are used as inputs.

Asymmetric Hopfield Network
The Hopfield model does not require hyperparameters other than
the ablated separation function. In many experiments, we use a polynomial separation function with
degree d set to 1 or 2. Bipolar representations (i.e., {-1, 1}) are used as inputs.

E
Experiments

In this section, we describe the setup of each figure in the main paper and provide additional
quantitative and qualitative results for each task. All experiments are run for 10 different seeds/trials.
We report the mean and standard deviation in all the figures and tables.

E.1
Sequence Capacity

Figure 3 A
This experiment plots the maximum offline sequence length (i.e., sequence capacity,
Tmax) at different input sizes. The input size Nc is varied from 10 to 100 while the number of active
bits W is fixed to 5. We compare variants of our model with Nk set to 4 and 8 to temporal predictive
coding (tPC) and Asymmetric Hopfield Network (AHN). We observe that AHN completely fails as
the sparsity S of the pattern decreases. Therefore, we also compare to AHN with the sparsity set to
50% (i.e., W = 0.5Nc). For AHN models, we experiment with a polynomial exponential function
with degrees 1 and 2, as recently proposed [12] and used for evaluation in recent papers [62]. All
models in this experiment are set to recall/generate in an offline manner, where only the first input is
provided. PAM outperforms all other methods and has the potential to improve further by expanding
the context neurons Nk. The patterns in this experiment are uncorrelated, such that each pattern has
active bits that are uniformly initialized.

Figure 3 B
This experiment plots the effect of sequence correlation on the maximum offline
capacity. The higher the correlation value, the more exact repetitions of patterns are available in the
sequence. We enforce correlation by limiting the number of unique patterns (i.e., vocab) used to
create the sequence. All patterns in this experiment are set to a size of Nc = 100 and W = 5 (except
for AHN, which is set at W = 0.5Nc). Results show that the capacity of all other methods sharply
drops when correlation is introduced. PAM retains most of its original capacity.

21


---Page Break---
Figure 3 E & F
In this experiment, we provide a qualitative example of a short sequence (T = 10)
with high correlation (0.8). The sequence is learned by all the methods; then we perform offline (E)
and online (F) recall on the sequence. We use the SDR autoencoder to create SDRs from these CIFAR
images for training and recall. The SDRs have a size Nc of 200 and W = 10. In the offline recall,
only the first input is provided and the model auto-regressively generates the full sequence using its
own predictions at every time step. In online recall, the models perform a single-step prediction and
always use the ground truth input at every time step to perform predictions. Results show that only
PAM can retain a context of correlated sequence and accurately predict into the future based on this
context.

Figure 8 A
In this experiment, we show the effect of scaling the model context memory beyond
a simple Nk = 4 and Nk = 8. We show that when using Nk = 16 and Nk = 24, PAM can model
much longer sequences. We vary the input size Nc from 10 to 50 and report the offline sequence
capacity of the model as ablations.

B

context memory size Nk and input size Nc. B: Online sequence capacity of various methods.

Figure 8 B
Similar to the experiment plotted in Figure 3 A, we report the sequence capacity with
input size Nc. However, this experiment evaluates the online generation capacity, where the model
uses the correct pattern at every prediction time step instead of using its own prediction from the
previous time step. Results show that PAM significantly increased in capacity (three times in some
cases), whereas the other methods have not increased as much in modeling longer sequences.

Figure 9
We provide additional qualitative example on a different highly correlated sequence. The
result shows a different failure mode for AHN, whereas PAM still performs well.

E.2
Catastrophic Forgetting

Figure 4 A
We benchmark the performance of difference models in the challenging continual
learning setup. The models are expected to avoid catastrophic forgetting by not overwriting previously
learned sequences. In this experiment, we use 50 sequences, each with size Nc = 100 and length
T = 10. We vary the correlation of the sequences from 0.0 to 0.5 and compute the backward transfer
metric with the normalized IoU as the measure of similarity. Results show that AHN can avoid
catastrophic forgetting when the sequence is uncorrelated but quickly drops in performance with
correlation. tPC fails to retain learned sequences regardless of correlation. PAM performs well with
more context neurons Nk. When setting Nk to 1, the model fails to retain its knowledge due to the
decreased context modeling capability with a single context neuron.

Figure 9: Additional qualitative example of correlated sequential memory with CIFAR images.

Figure 4 B
In this experiment, we report the performance of the models on protein sequences.
This is a more challenging setup due to the long sequence (a few hundred on average) with high
correlation (only 20 unique Amino Acids). We show a similar trend where the other methods fail due
to high correlation or sequence lengths. PAM outperforms the other methods when using context
memory Nk of 16 or 24. All Amino Acid types are converted to fixed and randomly initialized
SDRs with Nc = 100. The sparsity is set similar to sequence capacity experiments (i.e., W = 5 and
W = 0.5Nc).

Figure 4 F
We provide qualitative results on a simple experiment with 2 sequences from moving
MNIST. The models learn the first sequence and then learn the second sequence. The models are not
allowed to train on the first sequence after they have trained on the second sequence. We then perform
online generation on the first sequence with all models. We use the SDR autoencoder to generate
SDRs for all images in the sequences; the SDRs have Nc = 100 with W = 5 (for all methods except
AHN). The results show that PAM can recall the full sequence even after being trained on another
sequence. Other methods fail in this simple task, even in online recall setup.

Figure 10
We provide continual learning results similar to Figures 4 A & B; however, instead of
offline generation, we perform the evaluation in online manner.

Figure 11
We provide additional qualitative results on Moving MNIST, as well as quantitative
results averaged over 10 trials of MNIST sequence pairs. These quantitative results are reported as
the Mean Squared Error of the reconstructed image. Results show that PAM reports the lowest error
with a much smaller variance.

Tables 2, 3, 4, & 5
The Backward Transfer metric (BWT) to evaluate catastrophic forgetting is
computed by taking the average of the performance on previously learned sequences after training
on a new sequence. In addition to plotting this average in previous experiments, we provide the
full tables for one of the experiments as an example. All tables show results on 10 sequences and
Nc = 100. The BWT metric is calculated as the average of the similarity metric reported in these
tables.

E.3
Multiple Possibilities Generation

In this task, we evaluate the models’ ability to generate meaningful sequences and recall the full
dataset despite being presented with multiple valid possibilities. Ideally, the models are expected
to sample a single possibility if trained on sequences with ambiguous future continuations (equally
valid possibilities). This is a challenging task for most biologically plausible (e.g., tPC, AHN, etc.)
and implausible (e.g., transformers, RNNs, etc) models. Most approaches assume the existence of a
full set of possibilities and transform the task from regression to classification (e.g., LLM). For vision
tasks, some methods (VQ-VAE and its variants) cluster the dense representations to create this set of
possibilities and perform classification. We do not assume the existence of a full set of possibilities
but instead perform a true generative evaluation as a regression task.

Figure 4 C
In this experiment, we compute the average normalized IoU of the generated words.
The model’s ability to generate a full sequence with high IoU means it can produce sharp single
predictions despite being trained on multiple equally valid future predictions. As the number of words

25


---Page Break---
increases, the performance of other models decreases as they struggle to model ambiguous future
predictions; however, PAM outperforms the other approaches by sampling from these possibilities.

Figure 4 D
This experiment evaluates the ability of the models to recall the dataset words. We
compute the recall as the number of valid unique words generated divided by the total number of
words in the dataset. Since PAM is a generative stochastic model, the recall increases with every
generation. The other methods are deterministic and, therefore, do not report an increase in dataset
recall with more generations. The other methods completely fail to generate any meaningful words.
We use an average IoU threshold of 0.9 to classify a generated word as correct, similar to sequence
capacity experiments.

Figure 12
We provide qualitative results by showing the unique generated words by different
models after 5 dataset generations. PAM Nk = 4 generates some of the dataset words but also
generates many wrong words. By increasing the context memory neurons to Nk = 8, the model
generates many more correct words and reduces the false positives. The other methods cannot
generate meaningful words.

E.4
Noise Robustness

Figure 3 C
To evaluate for noise robustness, we plot each model’s performance (Normalized IoU)
with varying levels of noise added in an online generation setting. The noisy inputs are created by
changing a percentage of the active neurons to different uniformly chosen neurons in the SDR. The
noise is computed as a percentage for a fair comparison across different SDR sparsities (e.g., tPC
vs. AHN). We show the results for sequences of lengths T = 200 and no correlation. PAM has
the ability to compare the noisy input representation to the learned attractors to recover the correct
clean input. Therefore, even when the SDR is completely changed, PAM relies on its predictions and
completely ignores the noisy input. During generation, PAM always generates (or corrects a noisy
input) from within the predicted set of possibilities. The other approaches use the noisy inputs during
recall, which affects their performance.

Figure 4 E
We provide qualitative results on the CLEVRER dataset. The memories sequence is
learned by all the models, then a noisy sequence is used during generation. We only add noise starting
from the second pattern in the input sequence. The results show that tPC models are performing
relatively well, yet they are still outperformed by PAM Nk = 8. We set Nc = 200 in the SDR
autoencoder to learn the SDRs used in this experiment. We use 40% noise in this experiment.

Figure 13
We perform additional experiments on varying the sequence lengths and the correlation
in the sequence, all the other settings remain the same as in the experiment of Figure 3 C. The results

26


---Page Break---
show that with shorter sequences (≤200), no noise, and no correlation, all the models recall the
learned sequence well. When higher correlation is used, 2-layered tPC performs relatively well with
short sequences (i.e., T = 10) but fails with longer sequences (i.e., T = 100). The Hopfield model
fails more with correlation than sequence length. The added noise affects all reported methods except
for PAM due to its ability to rely on its predictions and attractors to clean the noisy signal.

Figure 14
We provide an additional qualitative example with similar trend to Figure 4 E. We also
provide quantitative results of CLEVRER averaged over 10 experiments. The mean squared error of
the generated sequence for multiple models at different noise levels is reported. It is clear that PAM
outperforms all methods, and a 2-layered tPC is the second best.

Efficiency

Figure 3 D
We compare the efficiency of the models and show that PAM is at least two orders of
magnitude more efficient than tPC with 2 layers. A single layer tPC is almost equivalent to PAM
with high context memory of Nk = 24. AHN is highly efficient as the model is not usually trained,
but the recall equation is used instead. Therefore, we exclude AHN from the comparison.

length. (B) Performance of PAM (Nc = 50, Nk = 4) generation for different connection densities.
(C) Backward transfer performance for PAM and 2-layer transformer on the protein sequence task.

Figure 15 A
We show the performance of PAM in an online and offline generation task as the
sequence length increases. In offline generation, incorrect predictions accumulate quickly, leading to
a sharp drop in performance. However, online generation attempts to correct inaccurate predictions;
therefore, performance smoothly degrades with sequence length. Note that both experiments (i.e.,
online and offline) use identical seeds/sequences for a fair comparison.

Figure 15 B
We provide additional results on testing the effect of connection density. While
neurons in PAM are currently densely connected (similar to Hopfield Network), we show that PAM
can still perform relatively well in a sparser setup.

Figure 15 C
We provide additional results comparing PAM to a 2-layer transformer on continually
learning protein sequences. Backward transfer results show low performance of transformers in
remembering older sequences after training on new sequences. Table 6 supplements these results
by showing detailed sequence-by-sequence performance values. Transformers excel at learning the
current task (diagonal values) but suffer in remembering previously learned tasks (lower triangle
values).

The table shows the mean normalized IoU of previous learned sequences after training on new
sequences. The Backward Transfer metric is the average of all the numbers in the lower triangle.

Discussions

F.1
Biological Plausibility

PAM inherits assumptions from Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) [25] that the sequence
modeling takes place in Layer IV of the cortical column, where it receives both thalamocortical
sensory driving input and contextual information. Sensory input arrives on the proximal dendrites of
pyramidal cells, while contextual information reaches the basal dendrites, priming specific contexts
by depolarizing neurons. Depolarized neurons then fire first and inhibit other neurons within the
same minicolumn via lateral inhibition, a process assumed to be mediated by interneurons (possibly
Double Bouquet Cells (DBCs)) [49]. HTM assumes interneurons [40] perform lateral inhibition
during prediction but does not learn the synapses of the interneurons. Interneurons are also assumed
to perform the inhibitory tasks of the attractor model [14].

Biological plausibility in PAM mainly refers to excluding the obvious biologically implausible
learning rules, such as backpropagation or copying of weights. This allows models like PC and HN to
be referred to as biologically plausible despite clear contradictions with anatomy [54, 14]. Moreover,
PAM also constrains its learning and representations to sparse and binary cell assemblies, which
improves the plausibility of the model. Therefore, a biologically plausible model here refers to the
ability to continually learn using only local learning rules (e.g., Hebbian, anti-Hebbian, STDP) and
sparse binary representations. However, we do not intend to accurately map every detail in PAM to
the anatomy of the neocortex.

F.2
Future Directions

In future work, we plan to implement a hierarchy of PAM blocks that supports compositional, part-
whole predictions. Unlike simply stacking layers as in Transformer or CNN architectures, our aim
is to establish a hierarchy where higher-level blocks make predictions based on broader, contextual
patterns. For instance, in vision, higher levels could predict entire objects based on multiple visual
cues, while in NLP, they could predict phrases or sentences rather than individual tokens. To achieve
this, each PAM level would send a summary representation of the current sequence (its latent state)
to the next level for recursive, higher-order processing.

Additionally, we plan to explore top-down feedback mechanisms between PAM blocks - inspired by
the hierarchical feedback observed in the neocortex. In the visual system, for example, top-down
signals travel from higher regions (e.g., V2) to lower ones (e.g., V1), reaching the apical dendrites
of pyramidal neurons. These connections originate in layer VI(a) of the higher region and form
en-passant synapses in layer VI(a) of the lower region in the hierarchy (e.g., V1). These connections
reach Layer I and provide feedback on the apical dendrites of other layers [61]. In PAM, a similar
feedback pathway could enable higher-level blocks to modulate lower-level processing based on
partial observations, refining predictions by ruling out certain lower-level possibilities that conflict
with higher-level context. For example, the attractor in the higher-level block can reach a decision on
the object being seen (e.g., human) based on partial observation (V1: layer III →V2: layer IV), and
therefore, the feedback inhibitory connections on the apical dendrites can rule out some lower-level
possibilities (e.g., paws).

G
Sparse Distributed Representations

The neocortex stores and represents information using sparse activity patterns, as demonstrated by
empirical evidence [4]. Inspired by HTM [25] and neuroscience-based theories of cortical function,
we use Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) as the main representation format of PAM. An
SDR is a sparse binary representation of a cell assembly where only a small fraction of the neurons
in the SDR are active at any time. The location of these active neurons encodes the information that
is represented by this SDR. In this section, we describe some useful properties of SDRs and discuss
their robustness to noise as opposed to dense representations.

29

G.1
SDR Properties

SDRs are used to represent rich sensory information in the neocortex as a sparse activity pattern.
Therefore, from a mathematical viewpoint, an SDR must have the ability to represent many patterns
and easily distinguish between them. The capacity of an SDR can be calculated as the possible
combinations of locations where neurons can be active. Consider an SDR with size N and number of
active neurons W. The total capacity of this SDR is computed as shown in Equation 12.

N
W


=
N!
W!(N −W)!
(12)

Based on the above Binomial coefficient equation, it may seem that sparsity is not optimal for capacity
as the capacity will be the highest when W is exactly half of N. While capacity is important, we
aim to represent multiple possibilities as a union of SDRs and, therefore, minimize the overlap
between them. From an information-theoretic viewpoint, the goal is to minimize mutual information
between SDRs to ensure that each SDR carries unique information and the union represents a more
comprehensive and diverse set of features. We can minimize the expected IoU by using lower
sparsities as shown in Theorem 2. In our experiments, we use N = 100 and W = 5, which results
in a capacity of ≈75 × 106 and an expected IoU of ≈0.02. However, when scaled up to more
typical values of SDR sizes and sparsities in the neocortex [25, 4] (i.e., N = 2048, W = 40), we
get capacity of ≈2.37 × 1084 (more than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe
≈1080) and expected IoU of ≈0.01. A sparsity of 0.5 maximizes the mutual information and results
in an expected IoU of 0.33, which cannot be used to represent multiple possibilities as a union of
SDRs in spite of the optimal capacity. In practice, the size N of the SDR is increased to increase the
capacity, and the sparsity W/N is decreased to minimize the expected overlap.

G.2
The robustness of SDRs

Sparse representations naturally minimize the overlap between random SDRs; therefore, they are very
tolerant to noise. To visualize this robustness property of SDRs, we design an experiment (Figure 16)
where we train an SDR autoencoder with different sparsities and then decode SDRs at various levels
of noise added. When the sparsity is increased to 50%, there is a high chance of overlap between
SDRs. Therefore, a small amount of noise can cause collisions between SDRs. However, a 5%
sparsity can tolerate much more noise without overlapping with other SDRs.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our claims are supported by experimental results and theoretical proofs where
applicable. Derivations are provided in the supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, the limitations section has been moved from the supplemental material to
the main paper for the camera ready version.
Guidelines:

31


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide proofs and derivations in the appendix, where applicable.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide general implementation details for all the methods used. Addition-
ally, we describe the experimental setup for every plot/table in the main paper and in the
appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

32


---Page Break---
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our codebase (now released) includes a script for every single experiment to
accurately reproduce the plots in the paper. We fix the seeds for exact reproducibility.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

33


---Page Break---
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide implementation details for all methods and the datasets’ details
in the appendix. The code also contains a separate configuration file with all the needed
parameters.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All experiments are repeated 10 times at different seeds. The means and
standard deviations are provided in all plots and tables.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We specify the compute resources required for PAM (i.e., CPU) and plot a
comparison of the time required by each method at different parameters in Figure 3 D.

Guidelines:

34


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper conforms with NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: PAM is a powerful sequence modeling algorithm. We do not see direct positive
or negative societal impacts.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Authors of comparison methods and datasets are properly cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No new assets are released.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

---Page Break---
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
