Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
on complex tasks, but they still suffer from out-of-date knowledge, hallucinations,
and opaque decision-making. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide
explicit and editable knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. Existing
paradigm of KG-augmented LLM manually predefines the breadth of exploration
space and requires flawless navigation in KGs. However, this paradigm cannot
adaptively explore reasoning paths in KGs based on the question semantics and
self-correct erroneous reasoning paths, resulting in a bottleneck in efficiency and
effect. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-correcting adaptive
planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG), which
first decomposes the question into several sub-objectives and then repeats the
process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths, updating memory, and reflecting
on the need to self-correct erroneous reasoning paths until arriving at the answer.
Specifically, three important mechanisms of Guidance, Memory, and Reflection
are designed to work together, to guarantee the adaptive breadth of self-correcting
planning for graph reasoning. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PoG.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have manifested outstanding performance in various natural
language processing and data science tasks, such as question answering [42, 25, 62], text gen-
eration [18, 13, 8, 15], recommender systems [60, 59, 51, 44], and domain-specific applica-
tions [46, 45, 14, 50, 36]. They leverage advanced deep learning techniques and immense amounts of
pre-existing text data to understand and generate human language with impressive fluency and coher-
ence. Despite their success in numerous applications, LLMs still suffer from out-of-date knowledge,
hallucinations, and opaque decision-making, highlighting the ongoing need for further investigation
in this rapidly evolving field.

Intuitively, as large-scale structural knowledge bases, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) [5, 1, 12, 43] provide
explicit and editable depictions of massive real-world knowledge, which have the potential to be a
promising complement to the drawbacks of LLMs. Previous studies manage to integrate KGs into
LLM pre-training [61, 47] or fine-tuning [53, 27] stage. However, these methods mainly compress
structured knowledge in KGs into LLMs’ parameters in a black-box fashion and still cannot fully

enhance the flexibility, reliability, and transparency of LLMs. Therefore, several attempts [3, 2, 40]
first retrieve information from KGs and then deliver explicit knowledge into LLMs. Under these
circumstances, LLMs do not directly participate in the graph reasoning process, making these methods
excessively dependent on the KG completeness. Recently, a KG-augmented LLM paradigm has
been proposed to conduct graph reasoning, which treats the LLM as an agent to interactively explore
related entities and relations on KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. For
instance, StructGPT [19] and ToG [35] predefine the breadth of reasoning paths explored on the KG,
and leverage the LLM to iterate the process of unidirectionally extending along the reasoning paths
relevant to the question and reasoning the answer using these reasoning paths. This KG-augmented
LLM paradigm offers an opportunity for more comprehensively amalgamating the knowledge from
both the KG and LLM by facilitating the step-by-step derivation of further insights.

However, existing paradigm may fail to plan the exploration of correct reasoning paths for many
complex questions. Figure 1 illustrates an example of existing paradigm’s limitations when answering
the question “Which of Taylor Swift’s songs has won American Music Awards? (AMA)”. These
limitations lie in: (1) Predefined path breadth: Existing paradigm requires manually setting the
breadth of reasoning paths in KGs, and a fixed breadth may result in all the selected relations or
entities being incorrect. When determining the relevance between paths and questions in step 2⃝, due
to the limited maximum breadth of three and the uncertainty surrounding the respective awards of
songs, the LLM selected maximum numbers of songs, ignoring the correct entity “Blank Space”. (2)
Irreversible exploration direction: The path exploration in existing paradigm is unidirectional without
the ability to self-correct. Even if the paths are incorrect, the LLM still continues to extend current
incorrect paths and lead to the failure of reasoning on the KG. In step 3⃝and 4⃝, since “The Joker
And The Queen”, “Shake It Off”, and “Cruel Summer” were already chosen, the reasoning process
continued on incorrect paths and the right answer was not found. (3) Forgetting partial conditions:
During reasoning, the LLM may forget partial conditions in the question and cannot provide the
answer that satisfies multiple conditions simultaneously. In step 4⃝, the LLM only remembered the
condition that the song was by Taylor Swift but forgot the condition about the song winning an AMA
award, leading to an incorrect answer, “Love Story”. Therefore, the reasoning of complex questions
may heavily rely on adaptive exploration and self-correction of erroneous reasoning paths.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-
augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design
a reflection mechanism for self-correction and adaptive KG exploration into KG-augmented LLMs,
effectively improving the ability and efficiency of LLM reasoning. Specifically, PoG first decomposes

---Page Break---
the question into several sub-objectives as guidance for planning exploration, and then repeats the
process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths to access relevant KG data, updating memory to
provide dynamic evidence for reflection, and reflecting on the need to self-correct reasoning paths
until arriving at the answer. In PoG, three mechanisms are designed for adaptive self-correcting
planning: (1) Guidance: To better guide adaptive exploration by harnessing conditions in the question,
we employ the LLM to decompose the question into sub-objectives containing conditions, thereby
benefiting the identification of relevant paths to each condition with flexible exploration breadth. (2)
Memory: The information stored in memory offers historical retrieval and reasoning information
for reflection. We record and update the subgraph to provide the LLM with all retrieved entities for
initializing new exploration and self-correcting paths, reasoning paths to preserve the relationships
between entities for LLM reasoning and allow for path correction, and sub-objective status to make
the LLM recognize the known information of each condition and mitigate its forgetting in reflection
stage. (3) Reflection: To determine whether to continue or self-correct current reasoning paths, we
design a reflection mechanism to employ the LLM to reason whether to consider other entities into
new exploration and decide which entities to backtrack to for self-correction based on information in
memory. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world KGQA datasets validate the effectiveness
and efficiency of PoG 1. The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows:

• We propose a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM
named PoG, which exploits the LLM to plan the adaptive breadth of reasoning paths and
reflect to self-correct erroneous paths. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
incorporate a reflection mechanism for self-correction and adaptive KG exploration into
KG-augmented LLMs, effectively augmenting the LLM’s reasoning ability.

• We specially design Guidance, Memory, and Reflection mechanisms for PoG. Guidance
harnesses question conditions to better plan adaptive exploration by decomposing task into
sub-objectives including conditions. Memory records the subgraph, reasoning paths, and
sub-objective status to provide historical retrieval and reasoning information for Reflection.
Based on Memory, Reflection reasons whether to self-correct reasoning paths and which entity
to backtrack to for initiating new exploration.

• We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world KGQA datasets, namely CWQ, We-
bQSP, and GrailQA. The results demonstrate not only the effectiveness but also the efficiency
of our proposed novel PoG paradigm for KG-augmented LLM.

Preliminary

Knowledge Graph (KG) stores massive factual knowledge in the form of a set of triplets: G =
{(e, r, e′) | e, e′ ∈E, r ∈R}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively.

Relation Paths are a sequence of relations: z = {r1, r2, ..., rl}, where ri ∈R denotes the i-th
relation in the path and l denotes the length of the path.

Reasoning Paths are the instances of a relation path z in the KG: pz = e0 →r1e1 →r2e2 →... →
rlel, where ei ∈E denotes the i-th entity and ri denotes the i-th relation in the relation path z.

Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is the task of answering natural language ques-
tions based on a set of facts over the KG. Given a question q, a knowledge graph G, and topic entities
Tq mentioned in q, the target of KGQA is to generate answers Aq to the question q. Following
previous studies [35], we assume any entity eq ∈Tq mentioned in q and answers aq ∈Aq are labeled
and linked to the corresponding entities in G, i.e., Tq, Aq ⊆E.

Methodology

In this section, we introduce the technical details of the novel self-correcting adaptive planning
paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG). As illustrated in Figure 2, PoG
consists of four key components: Task Decomposition, Path Exploration, Memory Updating, and
Evaluation. PoG first decomposes the question into several sub-objectives as guidance of planning
exploration and then repeats the process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths to access relevant
KG data, updating memory to provide historical retrieval and reasoning information for reflection,
and reflecting on the need to self-correct reasoning paths until arriving at the answer.

Figure 2: The framework overview of PoG, which includes four key components: Task Decomposi-
tion, Path Exploration, Memory Updating, and Evaluation.

3.1
Task Decomposition

To harness conditions in the question to better guide the adaptive exploration process, PoG decom-
poses the task of answering the question into multiple sub-objectives containing conditions through
semantic analysis of the LLM. Sub-objectives serve as guidance for path exploration, benefiting
the identification of relevant paths to each condition outlined in the question with flexible explo-
ration breadth. Specifically, we prompt the LLM to decompose the original question q into a list of
sub-objectives for KG retrieval and reasoning. The prompt is shown in Appendix A.1. The list of
sub-objectives can be denoted as O = {o1, o2, o3, ...}. It is important to note that sub-objectives in O
may refer to the results obtained from other sub-objectives in O, allowing for interdependencies in
the reasoning process.

3.2
Path Exploration

We access relevant information from the KG by exploring reasoning paths in the KG. On the initiation
of path exploration, we localize the initial entities of reasoning paths, which correspond to the topic
entities mentioned in the given question. Similar to prior research [19, 35], topic entities have been
pre-identified and are part of the annotated datasets. Specifically, when presented with a question q, we
use topic entities to serve as the initial elements of the reasoning paths, E0 = Tq = {e0
1, e0
2, ..., e0
N0},
where N0 is the number of topic entities.

In the subsequent iterations, we continue exploring reasoning paths most relevant to the question and
suspend other reasoning paths. Taking the D-th iteration as an example, before the iteration starts, each
reasoning path pn ∈P consists of Dpn(Dpn ≤D −1) triplets, i.e., pn = {(ed
s,n, rd
j,n, ed
o,n)}Dpn
d=1 ,
where ed
s,n and ed
o,n denote subject and object entities, rd
j,n is a specific relation between them,
(ed
s,n, rd
j,n, ed
o,n) and (ed+1
s,n , rd+1
j,n , ed+1
o,n ) are linked to each other. It is noted that the length of each
reasoning path may vary, because in the D-th iteration, we only continue exploring the reasoning
paths most semantically relevant to the question, which are identified in the D −1-th iteration. The
sets of tail entities and relations to be explored are denoted as ED−1 = {eD−1
1
, eD−1
2
, . . . , eD−1
ND−1}
and RD−1 = {rD−1
1
, rD−1
2
, . . . , rD−1
ND−1}, respectively, where ND−1 is the length of ED−1 and

4


---Page Break---
RD−1. We leverage the LLM to identify the most relevant entities ED from the neighboring entities
of the current entity set ED−1 based on the question q and extend the reasoning paths P with ED.
In order to manage the complexity of dealing with a large number of neighboring entities using the
LLM, we propose an adaptive exploration strategy that is not limited by the fixed number of relations
and entities. This strategy involves a two-step process of finding relevant relations and utilizing these
selected relations to explore entities.

Relation Exploration. Relation exploration is a process to retrieve the relations of all tail entities
in ED−1 and identify the most relevant relations to the question q and the sub-objectives O. To
be specific, we first conduct the search to obtain all relations linked to the tail entities in ED−1 as
the candidate relation set RD
cand = {rD
cand,1, rD
cand,2, ..., rD
cand,ND−1}. We utilize RD
cand to extend
the reasoning paths into candidate reasoning paths Pcand. Then, we employ the LLM to select a
flexible number of relevant reasoning paths P ending with the tail relations in RD from Pcand, based
on the semantic information of the question q, tail entities ED−1, candidate relations RD
cand, and
sub-objectives O. The prompt is shown in Appendix A.2.1, and the pre-defined query for relation
search is shown in Appendix B.1.

Entity Exploration. Analogously, entity exploration is a process to retrieve neighboring entities
based on RD and ED−1 and detect the most relevant entities to the question q. From the previous
relation exploration, we obtain extended reasoning paths P and new tail relations RD. For each
reasoning path pn ∈P, we can execute the queries of (eD−1
n
, rD
n , ?) or (?, rD
n , eD−1
n
) to retrieve
a candidate entity set ED
cand,n, where eD−1
n
and rD
n are the tail entity and relation in pn. When
confronted with a large number of candidate entities, we use a small pre-trained DistilBERT [31] 2,
to calculate the similarity between candidate entities and the question for recall. Then, we summarize
all candidate entity sets into ED
cand and use ED
cand as the tail entities to expand P into Pcand. With
the candidate reasoning paths Pcand, we exploit the LLM to choose a flexible number of relevant
reasoning paths P ending with the tail entities ED from Pcand, based on the semantic information of
the question q and knowledge triplets composed of tail entities ED−1, tail relations RD and candidate
entities ED
cand. The prompt is shown in Appendix A.2.2, and the pre-defined query for entity search
is shown in Appendix B.2.

3.3
Memory Updating

The information stored in memory provides historical retrieval and reasoning information for reflec-
tion. After a two-step exploration, we dynamically update the searched subgraph GSub, reasoning
paths P, and sub-objective status S in memory based on the ongoing reasoning process.

Subgraph. The subgraph includes all retrieved relations and entities from the KG. We update the
subgraph in memory, which can be utilized during later reflection to determine which entity to
backtrack to for self-correction. In the D-th iteration, the searched subgraph GSub is updated by
adding the retrieved candidate relation set RD
cand and candidate entity set ED
cand.

Reasoning Paths. In order to ensure that the LLM can understand relationships between entities for
better reasoning and allow for path correction in reflection stage, we update reasoning paths P to
preserve the semantic structure within the KG.

Sub-Objective Status. The LLM may forget partial conditions in the reasoning process. Sub-
objectives obtained by decomposing the question can help the LLM remember multiple conditions
in the question. The status of sub-objectives contains the current known information related to the
sub-objectives, which can aid the LLM in remembering the known information of each condition and
determining whether to correct the exploration direction in reflection stage. Hence, we leverage the
LLM to update the currently known information relevant to sub-objectives into sub-objective status
S = {s1, s2, s3, ...}, |S| = |O|, based on the semantic information of the question q, sub-objectives
O, historical sub-objective status, and reasoning paths P, along with the LLM’s own knowledge. The
prompt is shown in Appendix A.3.

3.4
Evaluation

After the path exploration and memory updating, PoG prompts the LLM to reason whether the current
acquired information, including sub-objective states and reasoning paths recorded in memory, is
sufficient to infer an answer. The prompt is shown in Appendix A.4.1. If the LLM determines that the

2https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-base-tas-b

5


---Page Break---
information is sufficient, it will integrate reasoning paths, sub-objective states, and its own knowledge
to provide an answer. When information is considered insufficient, there may be two situations.
One is that PoG will acquire sufficient information after further extension of current paths, and the
other is that current paths are incorrect. Since the reasoning capability of the LLM does not always
guarantee the correctness of path exploration, there is a need to self-correct erroneous reasoning
paths. Therefore, we design a reflection mechanism to determine whether and how to self-correct
reasoning paths. When the LLM believes that the information is insufficient, PoG enters the stage of
reflection. Specifically, PoG utilizes the LLM to reflect on whether to correct the current exploration
direction based on the question q, sub-objective status S, reasoning paths P, and entities planned
for the next iteration of retrieval ED from memory. Besides, the LLM will provide the reason for
the reflection result. If the LLM judges that it is necessary to incorporate additional entities beyond
those in ED for exploration, then a self-correction of reasoning paths is needed. Otherwise, PoG will
continue exploring along the current reasoning paths with tail entities in ED. For self-correction,
PoG employs the LLM to decide which entities in Ecand = E1
cand ∪E2
cand ∪... ∪ED
cand to backtrack to
based on sub-objective states in S and the reason for additional retrieval obtained from the reflection,
and adds new exploration of backtracked entities ED
add into ED for the self-correction, denoted as
ED = ED ∪ED
add. The prompts for reflection are shown in Appendix A.4.2.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental Setups

4.1.1
Datasets & Evaluation Metrics
To demonstrate the effectiveness of PoG on complex reasoning over knowledge graphs, we adopt three
representative multi-hop KGQA datasets: CWQ [37], WebQSP [56], and GrailQA [17]. All three
datasets rely on the external knowledge graph from Freebase [5]. For the large dataset GrailQA, we
utilize the same testing samples as those in ToG [35] to improve computational efficiency. Following
prior research [23, 19, 35], we use exact match accuracy (Hits@1) as the evaluation metric.

4.1.2
Comparison Methods
Due to variations in the performance of the method across different datasets, we select prior state-of-
the-art (SOTA) approaches as baselines for each dataset. They can be categorized into two groups:
(1) LLM-only methods, including standard prompting (IO prompt) [6], Chain-of-Thought prompting

GPT-4 is used as the underlying LLM, PoG substantially outperforms the SOTA baseline, ToG. ToG
explores reasoning paths with a fixed exploration breadth and cannot detect or correct the errors,
showing limitations in effect and efficiency. Meantime, we specially design self-correction and
adaptive planning mechanisms, which can effectively improve both performance and efficiency.
Second, although PoG is a training-free prompting method, its performance is highly competitive
with fine-tuned KG-augmented LLM baselines. When using GPT-4, the performance of PoG exceeds
all fine-tuned KG-augmented LLM baselines across the board. Even with GPT-3.5, the result of PoG
on GrailQA surpasses all fine-tuned KG-augmented LLM methods. This suggests that our designed
guidance, memory, and reflection mechanisms allow PoG’s effect to surpass most of the fine-tuned
methods. Third, the improvement of PoG is obvious when compared to LLM-only baselines, which
do not leverage external KGs. Besides, all KG-augmented LLM methods consistently outperform
LLM-only methods, indicating the value of incorporating KGs to enhance LLM performance. More-
over, PoG further improves the effectiveness of KG-augmented LLMs through its self-correctable
adaptive planning. Additionally, it is worth noting that PoG with GPT-3.5 outperforms other methods
on the zero-shot subset of the GrailQA dataset by a large margin, apparently outperforming all
fine-tuned KG-augmented LLMs on this category. The self-correction mechanism in PoG allows it to
dynamically correct errors during the reasoning process, which is crucial for zero-shot problems.

In order to assess the effectiveness of each mech-
anism and adaptive exploration in PoG, we con-
duct the ablation study to remove them on three
datasets, respectively. Specifically, w/o Guid-
ance refers to the variant where entire task de-
composition as guidance is removed. w/o Mem-
ory indicates the variant without the memory
mechanism. w/o Reflection refers to the variant
where, in the case of insufficient information, it only continues exploring along the original reasoning
paths. w/o Adaptive Breadth means that the variant uses a fixed exploration space breadth instead
of adapting it based on the situation. Table 3 shows the performance of all variants and the results
suggest that each mechanism and adaptive breadth appears to contribute positively to the overall
performance, with their removal leading to weaker results on complex question answering tasks
across the evaluated datasets. These variations achieve a minimum reduction of 3.0%, 2.1%, and
3.5% on CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA, respectively. The performance of w/o Memory drops the

most, followed by w/o Reflection, because without the memory there is no information to support
PoG in navigating the exploration and achieving self-correction, and PoG cannot self-correct the
wrong reasoning paths without the reflection mechanism. Moreover, after setting a fixed maximum
breadth for exploration, the performance deteriorates. This indicates that a fixed breadth makes the
method lack flexibility and less adaptable to different questions. However, because the mechanisms
of memory and reflection ensure that PoG is able to self-correct, the performance of w/o Adaptive
Breadth does not decrease a lot.

4.4
Efficiency Study

We study the efficiency of PoG and the SOTA prompting KG-augmented LLM baseline, ToG. Table 4
presents the average LLM call, token consumption, and time required by both methods to answer
a question across three datasets. In all datasets, PoG demonstrates clear advantages over ToG in
terms of all metrics. For average number of LLM calls, PoG consistently requires fewer calls to
the LLM, and reduces it by at least 40.8%. This highlights PoG’s ability to reason more efficiently
with fewer LLM interactions. Regarding token consumption, PoG exhibits a notable advantage
in both input and output token usage. On CWQ, compared to ToG’s input tokens, PoG shows a
reduction of approximately 4.6% in input token consumption. As for output tokens, PoG produces
just 353.159 output tokens, representing a substantial decrease of roughly 76.2%. This indicates
the effectiveness of PoG in reducing the overall token consumption during the reasoning process.
Most importantly, PoG achieves superior time efficiency compared to ToG. On CWQ and GrailQA,
PoG presents a speedup of over 4 times. ToG predefines the breadth of exploration, leading to the
exploration of many irrelevant paths. Additionally, ToG lacks a self-correction mechanism, and when
there is insufficient information to answer a question, it can only extend the current reasoning paths,
sacrificing a lot of efficiency on irrelevant explorations. By contrast, the efficiency advantages of
PoG can be attributed to its adaptive exploration and self-correction of reasoning paths based on
the semantics of the question. The adaptive breadth reduces unnecessary exploration, and effective
correction avoids the extending of wrong current paths.

4.5
Case Study

Figure 3 shows a typical case from the testing results on CWQ dataset. We compare the results of PoG,
ToG, and CoT in answering the question “Who is in control of the place where the movie ‘The Naked
and the Dead’ takes place?”. The underlying LLMs they used are all based on GPT-3.5. PoG initially
identifies a flexible number of relations related to the topic entities. Specifically, for “The Naked and
the Dead”, PoG successfully discovers that the movie takes place in Panama, while for “President of
Panama”, the LLM thinks that only the relation “government.government_office_or_title.jurisdiction”
is relevant. Upon retrieval, no information is found regarding the person in control of Panama.
This triggers reflection as PoG realizes that it lacks sufficient information. With the memory,
PoG refers to the sub-objective status and recognizes that it already knows the movie location
(Panama) for sub-objective #1 but is unaware of the person in control of Panama for sub-objective
#2. Based on the current reasoning paths, PoG makes a decision to execute self-correction and
returns to exploring the relation not previously explored for “President of Panama”. Due to the task
decomposition, during the self-correction process, it becomes easier to identify the correct relation
“government.government_office_or_title.office_holders” according to the sub-objectives. Through
the guidance, memory, and reflection mechanisms, PoG successfully finds the correct answer, “Juan
Carlos Varela”. In contrast, ToG fails to identify the most relevant relation concerning “President of
Panama” and continues exploring incorrect paths. This consumes a significant amount of time and
ultimately leads to an erroneous answer due to the hallucination. CoT refuses to answer directly since
the LLM realizes its lack of knowledge regarding the answer and requires additional information to
be provided. From this analysis, it is evident that PoG outperforms ToG and CoT. PoG successfully

Question: Who is in control of the place where the movie “The Naked and the Dead” takes place?

CoT

Answer: [Refused to answer.] I'm sorry, but I need to clarify the question a bit 
further in order to provide an accurate answer. Could you please specify whether 
you are referring to the character or the entity in control of the place where 
the movie “The Naked and the Dead” takes place? Thank you for your understanding. 

ToG

Answer: [KG exploration failed, and the LLM answered the question according to 
its own knowledge.] First, the movie “The Naked and the Dead” takes place during 
World War II. Second, the United States Army is in control of the place where the 
movie takes place. 

PoG

Answer: [Through reflection to self-correct paths, the answer was found on the 
revised paths.] The movie “The Naked and the Dead” takes place in Panama. The 
President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, is in control of Panama based on the 
knowledge triplets.

Related Work

LLM Reasoning. To encourage LLMs to engage in reasoning rather than simply providing answers
directly, many researchers instruct LLMs to generate the process of thinking in their outputs [49,
22, 63]. In the early stages, Chain of Thought (CoT) [49] was designed to provide a few examples
of intermediate natural language reasoning steps as the prompt. After that, several variants of
CoT reasoning with different forms like Tree-of-Thought [54], Graph-of-Thought [4], Memory of
Thought [24], and Skeleton-of-Thought [30] were proposed to enhance the thinking process. However,
LLMs may make mistakes during the reasoning process. Hence, many works [32, 21, 28, 29]
designed self-correction mechanisms based on feedback to rectify flawed reasoning and ensure
accuracy. Additionally, large efforts were dedicated to guiding LLMs in understanding complex
graph structures [39, 38] and improving their graph reasoning across different graph tasks [11, 10, 9].
However, it is still an open issue to address the outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and opaque
decision-making for LLM reasoning.

KG-Augmented LLM. Despite the pre-training of LLMs on massive corpora, they still suffer from
limitations such as outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and opaque decision-making. An effective
approach to address these limitations is to leverage KGs for explicit and editable knowledge provision
to LLMs. Previous studies integrated KGs into LLM pre-training [61, 47] or fine-tuning [53, 27]
stage, but they merely inject structured knowledge into LLMs’ parameters and still leave these
limitations unexplored. Therefore, several works [3, 2, 40] first retrieved information from KGs and
then directly fed explicit knowledge into LLMs. In this way, LLMs do not involve the graph reasoning
process and cannot provide potential insights. Then, a novel KG-augmented LLM paradigm [19, 35]

---Page Break---
was proposed to treat the LLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on
KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. Although this KG-augmented LLM
paradigm has achieved impressive performance, it still faces the challenges of adaptively exploring
the KG based on question semantics and self-correcting erroneous reasoning paths. To the best of
our knowledge, our work stands out as a pioneering effort in successfully integrating a reflection
mechanism for self-correction and adaptive KG exploration into KG-augmented LLMs, effectively
enhancing the LLM’s reasoning ability.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented
LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG). To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to incorporate a
reflection mechanism for self-correction and adaptive KG exploration into KG-augmented LLMs,
effectively augmenting LLM’s reasoning ability and efficiency. PoG first decomposed the question
into several sub-objectives, and then repeated the process of exploring reasoning paths, updating
memory, and reflecting on the need to self-correct reasoning paths until arriving at the answer. To
be specific, three important mechanisms were designed to work together to guarantee the adaptive
breadth of self-correcting planning for graph reasoning, i.e., Guidance, Memory, and Reflection.
Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world KGQA datasets validated not only the effectiveness
but also the efficiency of the proposed PoG.

Datasets

In this paper, we use three complex multi-hop KGQA datasets: ComplexWebQuestions [37], We-
bQSP [56], and GrailQA [17]. The statistics of datasets are shown in Table 5. WebQSP contains
questions from WebQuestions that are answerable by Freebase. It tests I.I.D. generalization on
questions. ComplexWebQuestions (CWQ) extends WebQSP and encompasses four types of complex
questions: conjunction, composition, comparative, and superlative. GrailQA is a diverse KGQA
dataset built on Freebase, and is designed to test three levels of generalization of models: I.I.D.,
compositional, and zero-shot.

Baseline Descriptions

The baselines we compare can be categorized into two groups: (1) LLM-only methods; (2) KG-
augmented LLM methods, including fine-tuned and prompting methods.

LLM-Only Methods

• Standard prompting (IO prompt) [6] verifies the ability of LLMs to achieve better performance
in task-agnostic, few-shot problems than traditional LMs.

• Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) [49] generates a series of intermediate reasoning steps in
prompts to help LLMs perform better in several NLP tasks.

• Self-Consistency (SC) [48] samples multiple, diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT,
and uses the generations to select the most consistent answer.

Finetuned KG-Augmented LLM Methods

• UniKGQA [20] unifies the graph retrieval and reasoning process into a single model with
LLMs.

• TIARA [34] first uses BERT to retrieve a set of schema items, which are further used as the
input, together with the question, to T5 for plan generation. They also apply constrained
decoding but only for grammaticality.

• RE-KBQA [7] capitalizes relations in KGs to enhance entity representations and introduce
additional supervision to improve the selection of reasoning paths.

• DeCAF [57] combines semantic parsing and LLMs reasoning to jointly generate answers,
which also reach salient performance on KGQA tasks.

• RoG [27] collaborates LLMs with KGs to achieve trustworthy reasoning to leverage structural
information.

• RnG-KBQA [55] first uses BERT to rank a set of enumerated candidate programs (up to a
limited complexity), and then uses T5 to edit the top programs into more complex programs.

• FC-KBQA [58] proposes a fine-to-coarse composition framework to avoid knowledge entan-
glement and guarantee both generalization ability and logical interpretability.

• Pangu [16] considers leveraging the discriminative ability of LLMs. It consists of a symbolic
agent with a cooperative neural LLM.

• FlexKBQA [26] is a flexible KGQA framework with LLMs. It can utilize a limited set of
annotated data to build KGQA for different KGs and query languages.

• GAIN [33] pays attention to the robustness of KGQA models. It proposes a data augmentation
method to alleviate this problem and further evaluates the distribution shifts including from
different aspects.

Prompting KG-Augmented LLM Methods

• KB-BINDER [23] is developed to challenge the heterogeneity of items from different KGs. It
enables few-shot in-context learning over KGQA tasks.

• KD-CoT [41] retrieves relevant knowledge from KGs to generate faithful reasoning plans for
LLMs.

• StructGPT [19] defines the interface of KG data to implement knowledge access and filter-
ing with finite quantity, and leverage the LLM to infer the answer or subsequent planning
repeatedly.

• Interactive KBQA [52] interacts with KGs directly and then generates logical forms. The
interactions are under three designed universal APIs for KGs.

• ToG [35] iteratively retrieves relevant triplets from KGs and employs the LLM to assess
whether the reasoning paths in beam search are sufficient for answering the question and if
further retrieval of the next hop is necessary.

Implementation Details

In our experiments, we use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to serve as the underlying LLMs. We call them by the
OpenAI official API 3. We set the temperature parameter to 0.3, frequency penalty to 0, and presence
penalty to 0. The maximum token length for generation is 1024. In all experiments, the depth of
exploration is set to 4 to avoid endless exploration. The experiments are conducted on a server with
two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2682 v4 @ 2.50GHz and 256 GB RAM memory.

Since LLMs are not entirely certain about when to stop,
we need to manually set the depth of KG exploration to
avoid endless exploration. To investigate the impact of
exploration depth on PoG performance, we conduct exper-
iments with depth settings ranging from 1 to 5 on CWQ
dataset. As shown in Figure 4, increasing the depth will
improve the performance of PoG. Beyond a depth of 4,
the improvement becomes less noticeable. The increase
in depth leads to exponential growth in resource and time
consumption. Considering the balance between efficiency
and effectiveness, we set the depth to 4.

Figure 5:
The proportion

In PoG, we design a reflection mechanism to provide the opportunity
for self-correction for exploring reasoning paths. In Figure 5, we
calculate the proportion of cases with reverse occurrences among all
questions in CWQ, and the results show that 24% of cases involve re-
versing during the exploration process to achieve self-correction. This
demonstrates that LLMs are indeed not always capable of making cor-
rect judgments in KG exploration and that self-correction is necessary
for KG-augmented LLMs. Figure 6 presents the proportion of correct
answers obtained by PoG after self-correction on three datasets. Over-
all, the self-correction in PoG appears to have positively impacted the
accuracy of KGQA, particularly for the WebQSP and CWQ datasets,
where the proportion of correct answers reached 64% and 48% after
the self-correction process. This analysis suggests that the reflection
mechanism in PoG has the potential to enhance the reasoning capabilities of KG-augmented LLM
and improve the performance across various datasets by allowing for self-correction and exploration
of alternative reasoning paths.

Answer: [The LLM hallucinates, inferring the answer with information of one condition.] 
Based on the given knowledge triplets, the genre of music favored by Claude Debussy that 
appears in the movie Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse is Incidental music.

Answer: [Through adaptive breadth and sub-objectives, the answer was found.] The genre of 
music favored by Claude Debussy is Ballet, and the movie Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse 
falls under the genre Ballet.

Sub-Objectives: 1. Identify the music favored by Claude Debussy; 2. Determine the genre of 
music featured in the movie Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse; 3. Select the music genres that 
meet the two criteria.

Sub-Objective Status: 1. The genre of music favored by Claude Debussy is Ballet; 2. The movie 
Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse falls under the genre Ballet; 3. Ballet is the final answer.

most relevant relation “music.artist.genre” to the topic entity “Claude Debussy”. Without constraining
the breadth of reasoning paths, PoG considers multiple candidate entities as potentially relevant to
the question. In the subsequent exploration of the topic entity “Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse”,
PoG adaptively chooses only “Ballet” as the relevant entity, as it records the known information of
sub-objective #1 in memory. Through adaptive breadth and memorization of sub-objective status,
PoG successfully and efficiently provides the correct answer. In contrast, ToG randomly explores
paths when faced with multiple candidate entities, only finding one condition from sub-objective
#1. Finally, ToG only remembers the genre of music favored by “Claude Debussy” but forgets
the condition from sub-objective #2, answering “Incidental music”. CoT directly hallucinates an
irrelevant answer, “Impressionism”. This case indicates the effectiveness of adaptive breadth and
memorization of sub-objective status.

H
Broader Impact & Limitation

In the current research landscape, PoG carries a significant broader impact, primarily reflected in its
enhancement of complex reasoning capabilities for KG-augmented LLM. By innovatively integrating
guidance, memory, and reflection mechanisms, PoG not only strengthens the model’s flexibility
and accuracy when facing complex queries but also enhances its ability to self-correct erroneous
reasoning paths. This self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm enables the model to backtrack
and adjust reasoning directions when faced with invalid initial assumptions or impasses, resulting
in an optimal solution search. Additionally, the broader impact of PoG is manifested in several
other aspects: (1) Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness in Problem-Solving: By dynamically
adjusting exploration breadth and employing self-correction mechanisms, PoG can more efficiently
handle complex questions and provide more accurate answers, significantly enhancing the overall
performance of KGQA systems. (2) Enhancing the Robustness and Adaptability of LLMs: Through
its memory mechanism, which records and tracks the completion status and reasoning paths of each
sub-objective, PoG enables the LLM to more robustly deal with the uncertainty and complexity of
questions, making it more precise and reliable across a wide range of applications. (3) Fostering
Innovation in the Field of Artificial Intelligence: PoG’s integration of meta-cognitive capabilities into

20


---Page Break---
reasoning and planning processes represents an innovative attempt that could further propel research
and innovation in broader AI technologies within the artificial intelligence field. (4) Improving User
Experience and Expanding Application Domains: With PoG’s reasoning capabilities, user experience
is greatly improved due to more accurate and quicker responses. Meanwhile, the domains where it
can be applied will also expand, particularly in environments that require handling complex queries
and responses involving large volumes of data.

There are still limitations in using PoG for addressing more complex problems. Some of the
key limitations include: (1) Low Self-Confidence: LLMs are still not entirely certain about what
information is needed, how many steps are required to extract the information, when to perform
dynamic updates, or if the current information is sufficient. In future work, we will focus on the
evaluation of LLM’s self-confidence. For example, this can be alleviated by training a small model
specifically for this evaluation task to improve accuracy. (2) Efficiency: Answering complex questions
requires multiple steps. In future work, we aim to design strategies to reduce steps and improve
task execution efficiency in situations of high self-confidence. (3) Non-Standardized Query: For
less standardized queries, semantic understanding might be insufficient due to limitations in the
capabilities of the LLM itself, leading to decreased effectiveness. In future work, we will address this
issue by employing SOTA query rewriting methods or interacting with the user to refine the query.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations in the Appendix H.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

22


---Page Break---
Justification: Please see Section 3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Section 4.1 and Appendix E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The datasets were released in public GitHub.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix E and Section 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

24


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We conduct the research with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Appendix H.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

25


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The datasets are from https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/ToG/tree/
main/data, and we present the licenses in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

---Page Break---
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will provide the documentation with assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
