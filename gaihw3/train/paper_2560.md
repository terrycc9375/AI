Abstract

As the usage of large language models (LLMs) grows, it becomes increasingly
important to serve them quickly and efficiently. While speculative decoding has
recently emerged as a promising direction for accelerating LLM serving, existing
methods are limited in their ability to scale to larger speculation budgets and adapt
to different hyperparameters. This paper introduces SEQUOIA, a scalable and robust
algorithm for speculative decoding. To improve scalability, SEQUOIA introduces a
dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal tree structure for the speculated
tokens. To achieve robust speculative decoding, SEQUOIA uses a novel sampling
and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding tem-
peratures. SEQUOIA improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and
Vicuna-33B on an A100 GPU by up to 4.04×, 3.73×, and 2.27×. To serve Llama3-
70B-Instruct on a single L40 GPU through offloading, SEQUOIA reduces the per-
token decoding latency to 0.60 s/token, 9.5× faster than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference.

Introduction

As large language models (LLMs) gain widespread adoption [3, 43, 7], efficiently serving these LLMs
becomes increasingly important. However, accelerating LLM inference is challenging since generating
a single new token requires accessing all parameters of the LLM [34]. As a result of this I/O bottleneck,
the hardware is poorly utilized during generation. This problem is exacerbated in both small-batch
and offloading-based inference settings, where generating one token takes as much time as processing
a prompt with hundreds or thousands of tokens on modern GPUs.

To address this challenge, recent work has introduced speculative decoding to accelerate LLM
inference while preserving the LLM’s output distribution [24, 5, 28, 40]. These approaches leverage
one or multiple draft models to predict the LLM’s output; the predictions are organized in a token
tree, whose nodes represent different sequences of speculated tokens. The correctness of these
speculated tokens is then verified in parallel through a single forward pass of the LLM. Using a token
tree—instead of a sequence—can increase the number of tokens accepted by the LLM by providing
several options for each token position.

gorithms perform well for small token trees but are sub-optimal for large tree sizes. For example, SpecIn-
fer constructs a token tree using k independent sequences, a topology that is bounded by the expected
number of tokens it can accept, regardless of the tree size (Figure 1). Second, we observe that existing
token tree sampling and verification algorithms are unable to perform well across inference hyperparam-

Figure 1: SEQUOIA is a scalable method for speculative decoding. Left: SEQUOIA tree construction
algorithm is able to generate trees whose average number of generated tokens (after verification)
continues to grow with the tree size while existing tree structures asymptote. This allows SEQUOIA to

eter configurations; for example, SpecInfer [28] and SpecTr [40] often perform poorly at low temper-
atures (Figure 3) since they can repeatedly sample an incorrect token with high draft model probability.

In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: how can we design an optimal
tree-based speculative decoding method to maximize speedups on modern hardware? Realizing this
goal requires addressing several technical challenges. First, for any tree size and depth, we must be
able to efficiently search the exponentially large space of tree topologies to find the one that maximizes
the expected number of generated tokens. Second, we must design a tree sampling and verification
procedure that performs well across inference hyperparameters, avoids repeatedly sampling incorrect
tokens, and maintains the correct output distribution.

This paper introduces SEQUOIA, a scalable and robust speculative decoding algorithm. As shown in
Figure 1, SEQUOIA can attain up to 9.5× speedups over incremental decoding and introduces several
key techniques to address the aforementioned challenges.

• In Section 3.1, to solve the first challenge, we formulate tree construction as a constrained
optimization problem and employ a dynamic programming algorithm to discover the optimal
speculative token tree. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that the number of tokens
generated with this tree structure is unbounded, growing roughly logarithmically with the tree’s size.
• In Section 3.2, to address the second challenge, we build upon the SpecInfer [28] algorithm by
performing sampling without replacement from the draft model—thereby preventing the draft model
from making the same mistake twice, while maintaining the target model’s output distribution. We
prove that this new sampling and verification method can attain high acceptance rates at both high
and low temperatures and validate this claim empirically.

In Section 4, we perform extensive end-to-end experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate
the effectiveness of SEQUOIA. We implement SEQUOIA on top of Hugging Face [45] with CUDA
Graphs [31, 32]. We show that SEQUOIA achieves up to 4.04× speedup for Llama2-7B on a single
A100 GPU and 9.5× for Llama3-70B-Instruct in the offloading setting on an L40 GPU. The latency
of Llama3-70B-Instruct offloading on L40 can be reduced to 0.60 s/token with SEQUOIA while the
inference speed of state-of-the-art offloading system (DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference [2]) is 5.7 s/token.
We also present ablation studies to show that: (1) the SEQUOIA tree structure can generate up to 33%
more tokens per decoding step compared to k independent sequences (tree size ≤512), demonstrating
better scalability; (2) the SEQUOIA sampling and verification algorithm is robust to the choice of
hyperparameters (temperature, top-p), providing up to 65% and 27% speedup compared to SpecInfer
and top-k sampling and verification algorithms, respectively.

Background

Here, we review tree-based speculative decoding methods. In particular, we discuss the way existing
methods choose the speculated tree structure (Section 2.1) and the algorithms they use to sample and
verify the token trees (Section 2.2).

2.1
Tree construction

The primary tree structure used by existing methods is one composed of k independent sequences
of length L that branch from the tree root (which corresponds to the current prefix). The SpecTr paper
additionally considers arbitrary branching patterns (k1,k2,...,kt), but says that this did not perform
better in their experiments than independent sequences. Medusa constructs a full k-ary tree, which
increases the success rate at each layer but cannot form a deep tree under moderate token budgets [4].

2.2
Tree sampling and verification

We now review how SpecInfer [28], SpecTr [40], naive sampling [28], and top-k sampling2 perform
token tree sampling and verification. With regard to sampling, SpecInfer, SpecTr, and naive sampling
all perform i.i.d. sampling with replacement from the draft model, while top-k sampling selects the
top-k highest probability tokens from the draft model. In terms of verification, SpecInfer and SpecTr
compare the draft and target model probabilities for the sampled tokens to decide which (if any) to
accept; naive and top-k sampling, on the other hand, sample a token from the target model distribution
and accept it if it corresponds to one of the tokens from the speculated tree. These methods all verify
a speculated token tree in a recursive manner—starting at the root of the tree—differing only in the
verification algorithm they apply at each node.
SpecInfer:
The SpecInfer method iteratively verifies tokens that were sampled from one or more
draft models. Like the original speculative decoding method [24], it compares the draft model
probabilities to those from the target model to decide if to accept. Note that while the SpecInfer
method allows sampling from k different draft models to generate k children for a node, in this
work we consider the more common setting where only one draft model is available. Therefore, we
compare with the version of SpecInfer which samples from a single draft model k times instead. To
see pseudocode for SpecInfer, please see Algorithm 2 and ignore all blue lines (lines 10-16).
SpecTr:
The SpecTr algorithm is similar in spirit to the SpecInfer algorithm. It iterates through the
children of a node, and uses a sampling procedure to decide if to accept a child, in such a way that the out-
put distribution is unchanged. One important property of this algorithm is that it is within a factor of (1−
1/e) of the best possible verification algorithm (i.e., the one with highest possible acceptance rate). For
brevity, we refer readers to Algorithm 3 in the SpecTr paper for the exact pseudocode for this algorithm.
Naive sampling and top-k sampling:
Given a node in a token tree, the verification algorithm for
naive sampling and top-k sampling first samples from the target model’s distribution P(· | x<n) at
that node, and then accepts this sample if it is equal to one of the children of that node. This verification
algorithm trivially maintains the target model output distribution—regardless of how the token tree
was generated—given that one always samples from the target model in this algorithm (as opposed
to from the draft model, like in SpecTr and SpecInfer). This observation motivates our choice—for
the top-k sampling method—to populate the tree by taking the top-k children of each node, instead of
the naive sampling approach of taking k i.i.d. samples (with replacement). We use the top-k sampling
method in our experiments in Section 3.2, to better understand the limits of this verification algorithm.

SEQUOIA

We now present SEQUOIA, a scalable and robust speculative decoding algorithm.

• In Section 3.1, we present our scalable tree construction algorithm, which uses dynamic programming
to solve for the optimal tree structure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the
number of tokens generated by verifying SEQUOIA trees scales nearly logarithmically in the size
of the tree, while existing tree structures asymptote in the number of tokens they can generate.
• In Section 3.2, we present our robust tree verification algorithm, which modifies the SpecInfer
algorithm by sampling without replacement from the draft model. We show both theoretically and
empirically that SEQUOIA is robust, performing well across temperature values, while existing
verification methods are not.

3.1
Tree construction

We now present the SEQUOIA tree construction algorithm (Section 3.1.1), and prove that the expected
number of tokens generated when verifying for these trees scales well with the tree size (Section 3.1.2).

2Top-k sampling is an improved version of naive sampling which we introduce as a baseline in this work.

SEQUOIA tree of size 64, and maximum depth 12. We
present more examples of SEQUOIA trees in Figure 5 in
Appendix E.

To derive the SEQUOIA tree construction
algorithm, wefirstexpressthetreeconstruc-
tion problem as a constrained optimization
problem, and then use dynamic program-
ming to solve this problem optimally and
efficiently. In this optimization problem,
we aim to maximize the expected num-
ber of tokens F(T ) generated by verify-
ing a token tree T , under a constraint on
the size of T . We begin by presenting a
closed form expression for F(T ) (Proposi-
tion 3.4). We then present our tree construc-
tion algorithm, which uses dynamic pro-
gramming to find the tree of size n which
maximizes this expression (for any value
of the speculation budget n).

We first present a number of important definitions:

Definition 3.1. Under the positional acceptance assumption, the probability of a verification algorithm
accepting a token t which is the kth child of an already accepted token depends only on the value of k.

Definition 3.2. The acceptance vector is the vector p=(p1,p2,...,pk,...) containing the probabilities
pk that the verification algorithm accepts a token at child position k. Under the positional acceptance
assumption, the acceptance dynamics of a verification algorithm can be completely described by the
acceptance vector.

Definition 3.3. Given an acceptance vector p and a tree T , we define the score function f(v) for a node
v∈T as f(v)=
Y

i∈Path(v)
pi. where Path(v) is equal to the list of child indices along the path from the

root to a node v∈T . For example, if v is the 3rd child of the root’s 2nd child, then Path(v)=[2,3]. We
define f(root)=1.

We are now ready to present Proposition 3.4 (proof in Appendix F.1.2), which shows the closed form
equation for the expected number of tokens generated by verifying a token tree T , under the positional
acceptance assumption. This is the equation which our SEQUOIA dynamic program will optimize.

Proposition 3.4. Let T be a token tree that is verified with the positional acceptance assumption, and
let f(v) denote the score function for a node v ∈T . Then the the expected number of tokens F(T )
generated by verifying T equals
F(T )=
X

v∈T
f(v).

SEQUOIA Dynamic Programing Algorithm.
The SEQUOIA tree construction algorithm finds the
tree T of size N which maximizes F(T ), using dynamic programming. Our algorithm works by
iteratively filling in the following 2-dimension tensor T:

T(n, b)=
max
T ,|T |=n, FirstBranch(T )=bF(T ),
∀0≤n≤N, 0≤b≤B.
(1)

Here, FirstBranch(T ) denotes the number of direct children the root of T has, and B denotes an upper
bound we impose on the number of direct children any node in the tree can have (we can let B =N −1
to make this constraint vacuous). Given the tensor T, the maximum expected number of generated
tokens for any tree of size n ≤N can be found by searching over all possible first-branch values b:
max0≤b≤B T[n, b].

We now show how to iteratively fill in the tensor T (which we initialize to negative ∞). Pseudocode for
the full dynamic programming method is shown in Algorithm 1).

As the base case, we set T[1,0] =1, representing the tree composed of just the root node, because 1
token is generated per iteration of speculative decoding when no tokens are speculated.

For the recursive case, we can consider the tree composed of the root node and its first b−1 children
and their descendants (tree #1), as well as the tree whose root is the last child of the root node and

4


---Page Break---
its descendants (tree #2). Letting m ≥1 denote the number of nodes in tree #2, we can see that the
expected number of generated tokens for tree #1 is T[n−m, b−1]. Furthermore, the expected number
of generated tokens for tree #2 is max0≤j≤B T[m, j], but this sub-tree is only considered in the
case where the bth child of the primary root node is accepted (which happens with probability P[b]).
Therefore, we can compute T[n, b] by searching over all possible sizes m for tree #2 to find the one
which maximizes the expected number of generated tokens for the full tree:

T[n, b]=
max
1≤m≤n−1


T[n−m, b−1]+P[b]· max
0≤j≤B T[m, j])

.

We show in Appendix F.1.1 that by keeping track of the values of m and b that maximize the max expres-
sions on lines 9 and 11, we can easily reconstruct the optimal tree T of size N (and FirstBranch(T )≤B)
that attains the maximum expected number of generated tokens. We additionally demonstrate in this
appendix (with python implementation) that we can extend this algorithm in a couple important ways:

• Bounded tree-depth: Because the amount of time it takes to speculate a token tree is proportional
to the depth of the tree, it can be very beneficial to find the tree of depth ≤D that maximizes the
expected number of generated tokens. We demonstrate in Algorithm 4 that we can extend the
SEQUOIA dynamic program to find the optimal tree of bounded depth.
• Compatibility with self-speculation: For self-speculation methods like Medusa [4], Eagle [25],
and GLIDE [11] which leverage the target model’s representations on the current prefix during
decoding, the acceptance rates can meaningfully degrade as you get deeper into the speculation
tree (i.e., further away from the current prefix). We demonstrate in Algorithm 4 that it is simple to
extend our SEQUOIA dynamic program to take as input a 2-D acceptance rate matrix (instead of a
1-D vector) containing the average acceptance rate vectors at different tree depths. Thus, SEQUOIA
is compatible with the latest advances in self-speculation methods, which can attain meaningfully
higher acceptance rates than “standalone” draft models.

This algorithm can be run offline, and thus does not slow down inference.

3.1.2
Theoretical Results

We now prove that the SEQUOIA tree construction algorithm scales well with the size of the speculated
tree. In particular, we show that under certain assumptions on the acceptance rates of the verification
algorithm, the number of generated tokens is lower-bounded by a function which is (roughly) loga-
rithmic in the size of the tree. This is in contrast to existing tree construction algorithms, which are
upper bounded in the expected number of tokens they generate, regardless of the size of the tree. For
example, a single sequence of tokens has upper bound 1/(1−P1) [24]; k independent sequences can
only increase this upper bound by 1, because they only increase the chance of acceptance of the first
token. Even an infinitely deep binary tree is upper bounded by 1/(1−P2).

We first define what it means for a verification algorithm to have a b power-law acceptance rate, and
then present our theorem on the scalability of SEQUOIA trees, under the assumption that the verification
algorithm has a b power-law acceptance rate.

Figure 3: Rejection rate vs. number speculated tokens: We plot the average rejection rate (1−
acceptance_rate) for the different verification algorithms, as a function of the number of speculated
tokens k. Across temperature settings ({0.2,0.6,1.0}, left to right), the SEQUOIA verification algorithm
attains the lowest rejection rates, and consistently has a power-law acceptance rate (Definition 3.5).

Definition 3.5. We say that a tree verification algorithm has a b power-law acceptance rate if the
chance rk of the tree verification algorithm rejecting all k speculated children of a node in a tree is
upper bounded by a power-law of k with exponent b—meaning, rk ≤1/kb ∀k∈N, for b>0∈R.

The above definition is motivated by our observation (Figure 3) that the SEQUOIA sampling/verification
algorithm attains power-law acceptance rates in practice. We now state the theorem (proof in App. F.3).

Empirical Validation

In Figure 1, we plot the average number of tokens generated by SEQUOIA trees relative to various
baseline tree structures, as a function of the number of tokens n in the tree, using Pythia-2.8B as
a draft model for Pythia-12B, and WikiText-103. We see that the number of generated tokens for
SEQUOIA trees is unbounded—scaling roughly logarithmically with the tree size—whereas the
other tree structures asymptote. We show results for more draft/target model pairs in Figure 6 in
Appendix G.3.

3.2
Tree sampling and verification

We present our token tree sampling and verification algorithm, and prove it is the first such algorithm to
satisfy two important robustness properties, while maintaining the target model’s output distribution.

3.2.1
Algorithm

We present the pseudocode for the SEQUOIA Tree sampling and verification algorithm in Algorithm 2.
As discussed in Section 2, an important motivation for designing the SEQUOIA verification algorithm
was the observation that SpecInfer and SpecTr both perform poorly at low temperatures, due to the fact
that they can repeatedly sample (and then reject) a low-quality token that the draft model is confident in.
Thus, we wanted to design an algorithm that would never make the same mistake twice—meaning, once
a token was rejected, it would never propose that token again. Toward this end, SEQUOIA introduces
two changes to the SpecInfer algorithm (shown in blue text in Algorithm 2): First, it performs sampling
without replacement using the draft model distribution. Second, if all the tokens with non-zero draft
model probability have already been sampled and rejected, it uses the uniform distribution over all
tokens that have not yet been sampled as the new draft model distribution. These changes significantly
improve the robustness of SEQUOIA relative to SpecInfer, while maintaining the guarantee that the
output distribution is identical to that of the target model (proof in Appendix F.2.1).

3.2.2
Theoretical Results

We now prove that the SEQUOIA verification algorithm is robust, in the sense that it satisfies both of the
properties below, while existing verification algorithms do not.

• The optimal transport property: When k=1, the acceptance rate is equal to 1−∥P −Q∥1

.3

• The cover property: If the support of the draft model probability distribution Q is of size k and is a
superset of the support of the target model probability distribution P, at most k speculations will
be needed to attain an acceptance rate of 1. Furthermore, if k is equal to the vocabulary size, the
acceptance rate should always be 1 as well, regardless of the draft model used.

Intuitively, satisfying the optimal transport property results in strong performance at high temperatures
(because P and Q will approach uniform distributions), while satisfying the cover property results in
strong performance at low temperatures (if top target model token is in the top-k draft model tokens).

We now present our main robustness result (proof in Appendix F.3):

Theorem 3.7. SEQUOIA verification satisfies both properties (optimal transport, cover); SpecInfer &
SpecTr only satisfy the optimal transport property; top-k sampling only satisfies the cover property.

3.2.3
Empirical Validation

In Figure 3, we plot the average rejection rates (equal to 1 −acceptance rates) for the different
verification algorithms, as a function of the number of speculated child tokens for a fixed token
prefix, for various temperatures (0.2, 0.6, 1.0), measured on WikiText-103. We can see that across
all temperature settings, the rejection rates for SEQUOIA decay faster than for the other algorithms.
In general, we observe that the rejection rates rk for SEQUOIA follow a power-law, where rk ≈1/kb
for some b > 0. We can also see that while SpecTr and SpecInfer perform relatively well at high
temperatures, they struggle at lower temperatures, and that the opposite is true for top-k sampling.

Evaluation

In this section, we aim to demonstrate that SEQUOIA can speed up LLM inference by a large margin in
wall-clock time. We first present our end-to-end system results showing total speedup, followed by
validating our claims that SEQUOIA is scalable and robust.

• In Section 4.1, we demonstrate SEQUOIA’s superior end-to-end performance. Specifically, SEQUOIA
achieves up-to 4.04× speed-up for Llama2-7B on A100 and 9.5× for Llama3-70B on L40 offloading
(achieving the latency as low as 0.60 s/token).
• In Section 4.2.1, we show that the SEQUOIA tree can generate on average 33% more tokens than a
tree of 16 independent sequences (tree size 512).

is the acceptance rate attained by the optimal verification
algorithm for k=1.

• In Section 4.2.2, show SEQUOIA’s sampling and verification algorithm is robust to temperature,
consistently outperforming SpecInfer (by up to 1.65×) and top-k sampling (by up to 1.27×).

4.1
End-to-end Results

We now demonstrate that SEQUOIA speeds up LLM decoding in the on-device setting by up 4.04× on
an A100 GPU, and up to 9.5× with offloading on an L40 GPU.

Setup.
Our experiments are based on Llama and Vicuna models. For the on-device setting, we
use JackFram/Llama-68m (JF68m) [28] and princeton-nlp/Sheared-Llama-1.3B (SL1.3B) [46] as
the draft models, and Llama2-7B [43], Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B [6] as the target models. For
the offloading setting, we use Llama2-7B-chat/Llama3-8B-Instruct as the draft model and Llama2-
70B-chat/Llama3-70B-Instruct as the target model. We evaluate our results on C4(en) [35] validation
dataset, OpenWebText [14], CNN DailyMail [36] and MT Bench [52]. In each experiment, we use
200 examples to measure the acceptance rate vector (mentioned in Section 3.1) and sample another
200 examples for evaluation (50 for offloading). The prompt length and generation length are both set
to 128 tokens except MT Bench. We evaluate SEQUOIA on different hardware including on-device
experiments on L40 and A100(-PCIE 80GB) GPUs, as well as offloading experiments on an L40
GPU (with PCIE4). We also compare SEQUOIA with SpecInfer [28] with 5×8 trees (5 independent
sequences of length 8, the tree structure used in [28] for batch size 1) for the on-device setting, and
16×48 trees for the offloading setting.

Implementation Details.
We implement the draft and target models using Transformers [45].
Because we determine the optimal tree structure in advance, we are able to use PyTorch CUDA
graphs [31, 32] to reduce the overhead of kernel launching during speculative decoding. To accelerate
sampling without replacement—which is not efficient in PyTorch 2.1 [32]—we use the exponential-sort
algorithm [44], combined with PyTorch CUDA graphs [31, 32]. For offloading setting, we used an
DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference [2] as baseline, which is 5.7 s/token.

Hardware-Aware Optimization.
For each hardware setting we consider in our experiments, we use
the following method for selecting the size and depth of the Sequoia tree we should use to maximize
speedups, while avoiding doing an exhaustive grid search. Letting G(n,d) denote the expected number
of tokens generated by verifying the SEQUOIA tree of size n and depth d (computed via dynamic
programming), t(n) denote the (hardware-dependent) amount of time it takes the target model to verify

1 token divided by the time to verify 1 token, the speedup attained by SEQUOIA can be expressed as
Speedup(n,d)=
G(n,d)
t(n)+d·c. We measure t(n) and c empirically for each type of model and inference
hardware, and then search over possible values of n, d to find the pair that gives the largest speedup.

Main Results.
We evaluate SEQUOIA using different temperatures, draft and target model pairs, and
hardware configurations. Results are shown in Table 1 (A100 on-device) and Table 2 (L40 offloading).
We observe that SEQUOIA consistently speeds up LLM decoding in a wide range of settings. SEQUOIA
reaches up to 4.04× speedup for the on-device setting, and up to 9.5× speedup for the offloading
setting, as a result of the huge gap between computation capacity and memory bandwidth. Notably,
for the offloading setting on L40, SEQUOIA can achieve as low as 0.60 s/token latency. We present
additional on-device results (A100 and L40) in Appendix G.

Analysis.
We made several interesting observations on the interplay between SEQUOIA tree construc-
tion, sampling and verification, and hardware-aware optimizer. (1) SEQUOIA selects much larger trees
in the offloading setting (768 tokens) than in the on-device setting (64 to 128 tokens). (2) In general, the
average number of generated tokens is close to the wall-clock time speedup (especially when JF68M
is used as the draft) as a result of the hardware-aware tree optimizer. (3) The optimal trees found by
SEQUOIA for slightly different configurations—e.g., different temperatures and model pairs—can
be very different from one another. (4) SEQUOIA chooses deeper trees at low temperature than high
temperature, due to the acceptance rates being higher for low temperature.

4.2
Ablations

We present our ablation experiments validating the scalability of the SEQUOIA tree construction
algorithm (Section 4.2.1), and the robustness of SEQUOIA tree sampling and verification algorithm
(Section 4.2.2). For each of these experiments, we only vary one element at a time (e.g., the tree
structure for Section 4.2.1) to study the gains attained by each component of SEQUOIA.

4.2.1
The Scalability of SEQUOIA

In Figure 4 (left) we compare the average number of generated tokens for the SEQUOIA tree construction
method, relative to k independent sequences, at different budgets; we use SEQUOIA’s sampling and
verification algorithm for all trees. The SEQUOIA tree is able to generate up to 33% more tokens per
decoding step, demonstrating the effectiveness of SEQUOIA’s tree construction algorithm. Here, we
use JackFram/Llama-68m as the draft model, Llama2-13B as the target model, 0.6 as the temperature,
and CNN Daily Mail as the dataset.

4.2.2
Robustness of SEQUOIA Sampling Algorithm

In Figure 4 (right) we compare the SEQUOIA sampling and verification algorithm to SpecInfer and
top-k sampling across different temperature values, holding the tree structure fixed. We can see that

9


---Page Break---
SEQUOIA achieves the largest speedups across all temperatures, attaining up to 1.65× and 1.27×
speedup relative to SpecInfer and top-k sampling, respectively. Here, we use JackFram/Llama-68m as
the draft model, Llama2-7B as the target model, CNN Daily Mail as the dataset, and the corresponding
SEQUOIA tree from Table 1 (temperature 0.6) as the tree structure. In Table 8 in Appendix G.4, we
additionally show that the SEQUOIA sampling/verification algorithm is robust to the top-p parameter.

Conclusion

We presented SEQUOIA, a scalable and robust speculative decoding method. By improving the
topology of the token tree and the sampling algorithms, SEQUOIA is able to speed up autoregressive
LLM inference up to 4.04× on GPU and 9.5× with offloading. In addition to providing real speedups,
we believe SEQUOIA also provides insight into both the large potential and fundamental limits of
speculative decoding systems. We hope that this understanding inspires future work in this area, or
even informs the design of custom chips for LLM inference.

Broader Impacts

In this paper, we present a new algorithm for accelerating speculative decoding. While there are
numerous application scenarios of large language models that warrant additional study regarding
possible societal impact, we would like to highlight that our work does not advance the capabilities
of these models. Our work is primarily an algorithmic study with no specific usage limitations, and
while LLMs themselves can be used with malicious purpose, we believe that none of such use cases are
specific to this paper.

B
Limitations

Theoretical limitations:
On the theoretical front, there are two primary limitations to our results:

1. The positional acceptance assumption (Definition 3.1: The optimality of our dynamic
program depends on this assumption. In particular, this assumption states that the only factor
influencing the acceptance rate for a token is what “number child” it is to it’s “parent token”
(e.g., if it is the first or fifth sampled token to follow the “parent” token). This allows us
to model the acceptance dynamics using simple closed form equations, which ignore all
contextual factors impacting acceptance rates (e.g., the current prefix, the confidence of the
draft model, etc.).

2. The b power law acceptance rate (Definition 3.5): While we observe in our experiments that
SEQUOIA satisfies this assumption (see Figure 3), it’s important to note that need this assump-
tion for our theoretical results on the scalability of SEQUOIA trees to hold (Theorem F.2).

Methodological limitations:
In terms of the limitations of SEQUOIA in practice, the most important
limitation/challenge is likely that the structure of the optimal SEQUOIA tree depends on the exact
(average) acceptance rate vector, which depends on the draft/target model pair, temperature value,
data domain, etc. The optimal tree also depends on the batch size, which can be considered by the
hardware-aware optimizer. It is relatively work-intensive to have to measure the acceptance rate vector
for each setting, and use this vector to compute the optimal tree. In practice, we believe computing a
single tree for a typical use case can work well for other use cases (e.g., higher/lower temperatures,
different data domains), but we leave a more thorough analysis of this issue for future work.

C
Related Work

This work introduces a new algorithm in the family of speculative decoding methods that aims
to maintain the exact output distribution of the target model by improving the structure and sam-
pling/verification algorithm for the speculated token tree. There exist many other directions within this
line of work—for example, methods which introduce leniency into the speculative decoding algorithm
to attain increased speed at the cost of accuracy [22, 38], methods that reuse layers or representations
from the target model as the draft model [50, 4], etc. Alternatively, the draft model can be distilled
to better approximate the target model; DistillSpec [53, 18, 41, 42] improves that process by using
model-generated data and adjusting the objective depending on the task and the decoding strategy.
Finally, LLMCad [47] proposes an advanced algorithm for token tree generation and verification in the
context of on-device LLM inference.

In addition to speculative decoding, there exist many other methods aimed at improving the speed
of LLM inference. For example, model quantization is another very promising way of dealing with
the I/O bottleneck during inference, by reducing the number of bits per parameter. However, unlike
speculative decoding, these methods generally deteriorate the quality of the model to some degree,
depending on the amount of quantization [17, 20, 30, 51, 26, 13, 10] or sparsity [29, 27, 19].

Meanwhile, various works [12, 39, 48, 1] have studied ways to improve LLM serving throughput. Pope
et al. [33] investigated the batching effect in scaling up LLM. Orca [49] proposed a distributed LLM
serving system that uses a finegrained scheduling policy to improve GPU utilization under various
request lengths. vLLM [23] used page tables to manage GPU memory to increase memory utilization,
which significantly boosts inference throughput. FlexGen [37] proposed an offloading mechanism to
support larger batches to achieve high throughput.

FlashAttention [9, 8] is another algorithm that aims to improve the speed of LLMs (at both training and
inference time) by considering the I/O cost of different operations.

14


---Page Break---
Another promising approaching to speeding up inference is to change the fundamental building blocks
of the model. Recently, numerous sub-quadratic architectures—including SSMs [16, 15] and linear
attention models [21]—have been proposed. These models are particularly beneficial for long inputs.

D
Background: Sequence-based speculative decoding

The original speculative decoding method [24, 5] proposes using a small “draft model” to speculate
γ tokens into the future, and then using the “target model” to in parallel process these tokens and
decide which of the tokens to “accept”, in such a way that the output distribution of the target model is
unchanged. This algorithm is presented in Algorithm 3.

Leviathan et al. [24] analyze the performance of this algorithm, presenting equations for the expected
number of accepted tokens from one run of the algorithm, and the expected wall-clock speed up from
using speculative decoding (relative to standard autoregressive inference with the target model). In
this analysis, they introduce the acceptance rate α∈[0,1], corresponding to the probability that a token
xi is accepted by Algorithm 3, under the simplifying assumption that the acceptance decisions are
i.i.d.4 Under this assumption, they show that the expected number of generated tokens in each run of
Algorithm 3 is 1−αγ+1

1−α . Additionally, letting c denote the ratio between the time to run the draft model
and the time to run the target model, they show that the expected wall-clock speed-up from using this
algorithm is
1−αγ+1
(1−α)(γc+1).

Method details and theoretical results

We present additional details (as well as proofs for theorems) about the SEQUOIA tree construction
(Section F.1) and tree sampling and verification (Section F.2) methods.

F.1
SEQUOIA tree construction algorithm

We begin by presenting details about the SEQUOIA tree construction algorithm, and its corresponding
theoretical properties.

F.1.1
SEQUOIA dynamic program details

In this section, we present an extended version of the SEQUOIA tree construction dynamic programming
(DP) algorithm (Algorithm 1), including a full python implementation of this extended algorithm
(Algorithm 4). In Algorithm 1, we showed how to compute the expected number of generated tokens
for the optimal tree of size N (and branching factor ≤B). Here, we extend the algorithm to be able to
handle:

1. An upper bound D on the depth of the token tree, and
2. Self-speculation methods like Eagle [25] whose acceptance rates decay for tokens that are
deeper in the speculated tree.

We then show how to additionally generate the optimal tree structure using dynamic programming, for
these more general settings.

Extensions to bounded depth and self-speculation methods:
To handle the above cases, we assume
that we have a 2-D array p, where P[d, b] is the probability of acceptance for a node at depth d and
branch number b. Here we assume p is zero-indexed, so depth 0 corresponds to the direct children of
the root node. We also assume p has shape (D −1, B+1), where D is the limit on the depth of the
speculated tree, and B is the limit on the branch factor of the tree (max number of children per node).
This allows us to infer that when we are computing T[n,d,b] (during the internal running of the DP
algorithm), in the case where the root node has a depth limit of D, the node being considered has depth
limit d it must be at depth D−d; thus, D−d is the index of the P array (at dimension 0) that should be
used at that time. Using this fact, we can show that the recursion equation for Eagle (with bounded
depth) is quite similar the one from Equation 1 (and Algorithm 1) in Section 3.1.1:

T[n, d, b]=
max
1≤m≤n−1


T[n−m, d, b−1]+P[D−d, b]· max
0≤j≤B T[m, d−1, j])


∀2≤n≤N, 2≤d≤D, 2≤b≤B.

Constructing the optimal tree structure:
In the python implementation below of the extended
SEQUOIA DP algorithm (Algorithm 4), we show how to recursively construct the optimal tree structure
for each tree size n and depth limit d. Throughout the DP we maintain the following data structures:

• best_new_node[n,d,b]: A pointer to the root of the best sub-tree to add as the bth child of
the tree root with budget n, depth <= d, and b children.
• best_tree[n,d]: A pointer to root of the best tree with n nodes and depth <= d.

Line 32, and then lines 40-45, demonstrate the recursive relationship between these tree structures:

• If m∗is the optimal number of tokens that should be assigned to the tree rooted at the bth (and
last) child for the tree (For the (n,d,b) tree), then we can look up the optimal tree of that size
in best_tree[m∗,d−1], and set best_new_node[n,d,b]=best_tree[m∗,d−1].
• If b∗is the optimal number of children for a tree of size n and depth ≤d, we can look-up
best_new_node[n, d, b∗] (the root of a tree of size m′) and assign that as the last child
of best_tree[n,d]. To then find the optimal (b −1)th child of this tree, we can look-up
best_new_node[n−m′,d,b∗−1], and we can continue in this manner until we have added
all b∗children to best_tree[n,d].

This demonstrates how to build the optimal tree as part of the dynamic program.

F.1.2
Proof of Proposition 3.4: Closed-form expression for F(T )

We now prove Proposition 3.4 by deriving the closed-form expression for F(T ) (the expected number
of tokens generated by verifying tree T ), and show how to use dynamic programming to find the
optimal tree T under a tree budget size.

Proposition F.1. Let T be a token tree that is verified with the positional acceptance assumption,
and let f(v) denote the score function for a node v ∈T . Then the expected number of tokens F(T )
generated by verifying T is equal to

F(T )=
X

v∈T
f(v).

18


---Page Break---
Proof. Let D(T ) denote the expected number of tokens generated by verifying tree T . We would like
to prove that D(T )=F(T )∀T . We will prove this by induction on the size of T .

Base case (N =1):
A tree of size 1 is composed solely of the root node. By definition of the score
function f(v) (Definition 3.3), we know that f(v)=1 for the root node, so F(T )=1. D(T )=1 also,
because verifying a tree composed of a root node with no children will simply sample from the target
model, and generate 1 token.

Inductive step (N >1):
For |T |=N >1, let v be a leaf of T at child index iv of depth d with parent
vp and sibling Sv (set of sibling indices). We can then consider the tree T ′ =T −{v}. Based on the
inductive assumption, we know that g(T ′)=D(T ′). Using this assumption, we can express D(T ) in
terms of D(T ′):

D(T )=D(T ′)−(d−1)·f(vp)·

=
X

v′∈T ′
f(v′)−(d−1)f(v)+d·f(v)

=F(T ′)+f(v)
=F(T )

Note that we use the inductive hypothesis, along with the fact the f(vp)·piv =f(v) (by definition of
f(v)).

F.1.3
Proof of Theorem 3.6: Main scalability results for SEQUOIA trees

We now prove that, under certain assumptions on the acceptance rates of the tree verification algorithm,
the expected number of tokens generated by verifying the SEQUOIA tree is lower bounded by a function
which is roughly logarithmic in the size of the tree. We will do this by showing that a simpler tree—the
k∗(n) tree (defined below)—also has this lower bound, and using the fact that the SEQUOIA tree is by
construction the tree with the largest expected number of generated tokens.

We define the k∗(n) tree to be the k-ary tree5 with ≤n nodes that has the highest expected accepted
sequence length. Letting G(n) denote the expected accepted sequence length for the k∗(n) tree, we will
now prove that G(n)∈Ω

(meaning, it is lower-bounded by a scalar multiple of
blog(n)/log(log(n))), under the assumption that the rejection rate rk is upper-bounded by a power-law
of k. It then follows directly (as a corollary) that the growth rate of the tree generated by the SEQUOIA
algorithm will also be in Ω

Theorem F.2. Assume the chance rk of a token tree verification algorithm rejecting all k speculated
tokens (k child nodes of some node in the tree) is upper bounded by a power-law of k; so rk ≤1/kb for
some b>0∈R. Then the growth rate G(n) for the k∗(n) tree is in Ω

blog(n)/log(log(n)

.

Proof. We will let k(n)=⌊log(n)1/b⌋denote the branch-width chosen for tree size n, and show that
under this assumption, the growth rate G′(n) of the corresponding k(n)-tree is at least
blog(n)
10log(log(n),
assuming that n is large enough. Given that G′(n) is a lower bound on G(n) (because the above
choice of k(n) might not be fully optimal), and using the definition of Ω, this proves that G(n) ∈
Ω

blog(n)/log(log(n)

. Note that we will abbreviate k(n) as k in many places throughout the proof,
for brevity.

If we let d denote the depth of the tree, the number of nodes in the tree is 1 + k + k2 + ... + kd =

≤n. This implies d≤logk(n), which we can prove as follows:

kd+1−1≤n(k−1)

⇒d+1≤logk(nk)=logk(n)+1
⇒d≤logk(n)

We can assume d is the largest integer such that d≤logk(n), so it also follows that d+1≥logk(n).

Letting αk :=1−rk, the expected length G′(n) of the accepted token sequence can be expressed as

growth rate for the SEQUOIA tree is in Ω

.

Proof. By construction, for every tree size n, the SEQUOIA tree is the tree that has the largest expected
number of generated tokens. Thus, for every value of n the expected number of generated tokens for
the SEQUOIA tree must be larger than that of the k∗(n) tree, which was shown in Theorem F.2 to be in

SEQUOIA sampling and verification algorithm

We now move on to presenting proofs about the correctness and robustness of the SEQUOIA sampling
and verification method.

F.2.1
Proof of correctness for the SEQUOIA sampling and verification algorithm

We prove now that the SEQUOIA verification algorithm maintains the output distribution of the target
model. We assume we have a target model t, and a list of draft models (d1,...dn,dn+1,...), where di in
this case depends on the previously rejected samples x1,...,xi−1, and where di(u) and t(u) denote the
probabilities of sampling token u∈V from di or t respectively (where V is the token vocabulary). We
let ti denote the residual at iteration i of SEQUOIA loop, (after i−1 nodes have been rejected (so t1 =t,
as can be seen in Algorithm 2)

We will prove by induction on the number of proposed tokens n that the SEQUOIA verification algorithm
is correct.

Base case (n=0): SEQUOIA is trivially correct, as it will simply sample from the residual t1, which is
equal to t.

Recursive case: We assume SEQUOIA is correct for n−1 proposed samples and prove it is correct for
n proposed samples.

We first show that at stage i in the speculative decoding algorithm, the chance of SEQUOIA choosing to
reject the proposed sample is equal to P

We are now ready to prove the recursive case of the SEQUOIA algorithm. By the inductive hypothesis,
we know that for all u∈V ,
t(u)=P(u accepted in first n−1 iterations)+P(No token accepted in first n−1 iterations)·tn(u)

What this means is that in the case where we run SEQUOIA for n−1 iterations (and if no token is
accepted we sample from the residual tn), this is equivalent to sampling from the target distribution t
directly. We would like to show that this output distribution is equivalent to the one we would get if
we run SEQUOIA for n iterations (and if no token is accepted we sample from the residual tn+1). The

22


---Page Break---
output distribution of this scenario can be written as follows:
P(u accepted in first n−1 iterations)+P(No token accepted in first n−1 iterations)·

dn(u)·P(u accepted at iteration n)+P(No token accepted in iteration n)·tn+1(u)


Thus, all we must show is that
tn(u)=dn(u)·P(u accepted at iteration n)+P(No token accepted in iteration n)·tn+1(u)

We now show this desired result. We will use Lemma F.5, and the fact that by definition of the SpecInfer

algorithm (see Algorithm 2, ignoring blue lines), we know that tn+1(u)=



To see that this last equality holds, we consider two cases:

1. Case 1

tn(u) ≥dn(u)

: min(dn(u), tn(u))+max(0, tn(u)−dn(u)) = dn(u)+tn(u)−

dn(u)=tn(u).

2. Case 1

tn(u)<dn(u)

: min(dn(u),tn(u))+max(0,tn(u)−dn(u))=tn(u)+0=tn(u).

This completes the proof.

F.3
Proof of Theorem 3.7: Main robustness result for SEQUOIA sampling and verification

We now prove the robustness results for the SEQUOIA verification algorithm.

Theorem F.6. The SEQUOIA verification algorithm satisfies both the optimal transport and the cover
properties, while SpecInfer and SpecTr only satisfy the optimal transport property, and (top-k) naive
sampling only satisfies the cover property.

Proof. This proof is quite straightforward:

• SEQUOIA satisfies the optimal transport property: It is clear that SEQUOIA satisfies the
optimal transport property, because at k=1, it is identical to the original speculative decoding
algorithm [24].

• SEQUOIA satisfies the cover property: To see why SEQUOIA satisfies the cover property,
we will use the following two facts:

– If the support of Q is of size k and k tokens are speculated by the draft model, the set of
speculated tokens will always exactly equal the k tokens in the support of Q (because
SEQUOIA does sampling without replacement from the draft model).
– During the verification for-loop in Algorithm 2, the support of the residual will always
be contained in the support of P intersected with the set of tokens that have not yet
been rejected. This is because the support of the residual can never grow (because
pi(x) = 0 ⇒pi+1(x) = norm(max(pi −qi,0))(x) = 0, where pi and qi denote the
residual and draft probabilities at iteration i, respectively), and because if a token x is
rejected it will “exit” the residual (because x is rejected implies qi(x) > pi(x) which
implies that pi+1(x)=norm(max(pi−qi,0))(x)=0).

23


---Page Break---
Combining these two facts, we can see that if the first k−1 tokens were rejected, then the
kth token must be accepted, because the residual must be a one-hot vector with probability
1 at the only remaining token, and the (updated) draft probabilities will also be this same
one-hot vector (and thus, accepted with probability 1). Additionally, we can see that if V
tokens are sampled (where V is the vocab size), these must exactly equal the V tokens in the
vocabulary, and thus one of those tokens must be accepted. In the case where the support of
Q is equal to the full vocabulary, this result follows directly from the discussion above. In
the case where the support of Q does not equal the full vocabulary, this is a result of the fact
that once all tokens in the support of Q have been sampled and rejected, we begin sampling
(without replacement) from the uniform distribution over all non-rejected tokens.

• SpecInfer satisfies the optimal transport property: For k=1, SpecInfer is identical to the
original speculative decoding algorithm [24].

• SpecInfer does not satisfy the cover property: It is easy to see that SpecInfer does not satisfy
the cover property, with the following counter-example. Let Q=[0.5,0.5] and P =[1.0,0].
We can see that the support of Q is of size 2 and contains the support of P. But with probability
25%, SpecInfer will sample the second token twice in a row, and will reject both of them.

• SpecTr satisfies the optimal transport property: For k = 1, SpecTr is identical to the
original speculative decoding algorithm [24], because γ =1 by definition.

• SpecTr does not satisfies the cover property: We can show that SpecTr (in partic-
ular, the ‘k-sequential selection’ algorithm from [40]) does not satisfy the cover prop-
erty, with the following counter-example.
Let P = [1, 0] and Q = [0.5, 0.5].
Then
βp,q(γ) = P1
x=0 min(Q(x),P(x)/γ) = min(0.5,1/γ) + min(0.5,0/γ) = 0.5 (because
γ ∈[1,2] by assumption). We know the acceptance rate of SpecTr is 1−(1−βp,q(γ))2 =
1−(1−0.5)2 =0.75̸=1. Thus, SpecTr does not satisfy the cover property.

• Top-k naive sampling does not satisfy the optimal transport property: Letting Q =
[0.6,0.4] and P =[0.6,0.4], we can see that top-k naive sampling will accept with probability
0.6, whereas 1−∥P −Q∥/2=1.0.

• Top-k naive sampling satisfies the cover property: It’s easy to see that if the support of Q is
of size k and contains the support of P, then top-k naive sampling will always accept (because
it will sample from the target model and accept if the sampled token is among the top-k tokens
according to the draft model). Similarly, if k=V , it must accept as well (because the top-V
tokens must be the full vocabulary, and so any sample from the target model must accept).

Additional Experiments

Additional end-to-end speedup results

We provide additional end-to-end results comparing SEQUOIA to baselines, extending the results from
Section 4.1. Here (Tables 3 and 4), we provide on-device results on A100 and L40 GPUs, for a more
extended set of models, relative to the results in Table 1, but on different hardware.

G.2
More Comparisons with SpecInfer

To demonstrate the optimality of SEQUOIA’s tree construction, we provide a sweep of tree configura-
tions and corresponding speedups of SpecInfer in Tables 5 and 6. SEQUOIA attains better speedups in
both greedy decoding and stochastic decoding than all tree configurations of SpecInfer.

Here we present additional results demonstrating the scalability of the SEQUOIA tree construction
algorithm relative to baselines, for several Pythia draft and target model pairs on the WikiText-103

Evaluation of SEQUOIA hardware-aware optimizer

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEQUOIA hardware-aware tree optimizer. We
compare the speedups attained by the SEQUOIA trees of various sizes from Figure 4 (left) to the trees
selected by the hardware-aware tree-optimizer. Because the tree optimizer is able to limit the tree depth
to make speculation faster, it is able to attain larger end-to-end speedups than any of the SEQUOIA trees
from Figure 4 (left), whose structures were chosen to maximize the expected number of generated
tokens (not the speedup). The optimizer is also able to automatically find the tree size that produces the
largest overall speedup.

Figure 6: Number of generated tokens vs. tree size: We plot the average number of tokens generated
for different tree structures per decoding step of the target model, as a function of the tree size, for
different draft and target model pairs. The number of generated tokens for SEQUOIA trees continues to
grow with the tree size, while other tree structures asymptote.

As mentioned in Section 4.1, one of the inputs to the hardware aware optimizer is t(n), which is the
hardware-dependent amount of time it takes the target model to verify n tokens divided by the time to
verify 1 token. In Figure 8 we show the forward pass times for different models on different hardware,
for different number of tokens n. As you can see, the forward pass times are roughly constant for low
values of n, but then eventually start growing roughly linearly in n—the value of n at which t(n) begins
to grow is model and hardware dependent. In general, this value of n is lower for hardware that has

limiting the depth of the tree it can make speculation faster and thus attain larger speedups than the
trees with unconstrained depth (orange lines).

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: N/A

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss limitations in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

28


---Page Break---
Justification: All theoretical results are proven in Appendix F, and all assumptions are defined
in Section 3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In our supplementary zip file, we provide all code and evaluation datasets used,
along with a README with instructions. We use public checkpoints for all draft and target
models, public data for all evaluations, and report the hardware and hyperparameters used for
each experiment.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether
the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions
to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we provide a zip file with the code and data needed to reproduce our
experiments, as well as a README with instructions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We share our evaluation datasets, hyperparameters, and code. Our paper is about
inference, so we do not perform training.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported due to computational expense.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the
main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

30


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the
experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss computational resources used for all experiments in Section 4.
For on-device experiments, we have reported the GPU (L40 and A100-PCIE-80G), and for
offloading experiments, we have reported the GPU (L40) and PCIE4 (31.5GB/s).
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our paper relates to efficient inference for existing models, not to training
models with new functionality.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special considera-
tion due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

31


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release new data or models.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the papers that introduced the models and data used in our work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.

32


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include a README along with our code to reproduce our experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well
as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals
(or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution)
were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include experiments with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
