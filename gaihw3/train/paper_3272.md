Abstract

Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in the field of 3D vision.
Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new insights into
this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to
dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading
to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above
issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called
MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D
Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module
that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to
camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can
effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion
of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed
to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact
of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic
scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits
significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results. Project page:

Introduction

Dynamic scene reconstruction aims to model the 3D structure and appearance of time-evolving
scenes, enabling novel-view synthesis at arbitrary timestamps. It is a crucial task in the field of 3D
computer vision, attracting widespread attention from the research community and finding important
applications in areas such as virtual/augmented reality and 3D content production. In comparison to
static scene reconstruction, dynamic scene reconstruction remains a longstanding open challenge due
to the difficulties arising from motion complexity and topology changes.

In recent years, a plethora of dynamic scene reconstruction methods [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have been
proposed based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [9], driving rapid advancements in this field. While
these methods exhibit impressive visual quality, their substantial computational overhead impedes
their applications in real-time scenarios. Recently, a novel approach called 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) [10], has garnered widespread attention in the research community. By introducing explicit
3D Gaussian representation and efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DGS has achieved unprecedented
high-quality novel-view synthesis with real-time rendering. Subsequent methods [11, 12, 13, 14,

supervision of optical flow and motion flow respectively. The latter can produce a more direct
description of object motion, thereby effectively guiding the deformation of 3D Gaussians. (b) The
decoupling of optical flow. We decouple the optical flow into motion flow which is only related to
object motion and camera flow which is only related to camera motion.

15, 16, 17] rapidly extend 3DGS to dynamic scenes, also named 4D scenes. Initially, D-3DGS [11]
proposes to iteratively reconstruct the scene frame by frame, but it incurs significant memory overhead.
The more straightforward approaches [13, 17] utilize a deformation field to simulate the motion
of objects by moving the 3D Gaussians to their corresponding positions at different time steps.
Besides, some methods [12, 18] do not independently model motion but treat space-time as a whole
to optimize. While these methods effectively extend 3DGS to dynamic scenes, they rely solely on
appearance to supervise dynamic scene reconstruction, lacking explicit motion guidance on Gaussian
deformation. When object motion is irregular (e.g., sudden movements), the model may encounter
optimization difficulties and fall into local optima.

Based on the above discussions, we argue that explicit motion guidance is indispensable for the
deformation of 3D Gaussians. Benefiting from the advancements in optical flow estimation [19, 20], a
natural solution is to utilize an off-the-shelf optical flow network to provide 2D motion priors [21, 22].
However, the formation of optical flow is affected by both camera motion and object motion, which
is not conducive to explicit modeling of object motion. Therefore, it is necessary to separate the
optical flow related only to the moving object (i.e., motion flow) to guide Gaussian deformation more
efficiently. As shown in Figure 1(a), directly using optical flow (column 2) to supervise the Gaussian
deformation will inevitably include the contribution of static objects to the optical flow, while using
motion flow as supervision (column 3) can easily avoid this. Besides, the estimated camera pose in
dynamic scenes is not always accurate. Due to the lack of geometric consistency between adjacent
frames for moving objects, using point correspondences on dynamic objects to calculate the camera
pose can lead to erroneous offsets, thereby affecting the optimization of 3DGS.

To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting framework
called MotionGS, which explicitly constrains the deformation of 3D Gaussians by extracting the
motion priors from optical flow. Our method includes an optical flow decoupling module and a
camera pose refinement module. In the optical flow decoupling module, we decouple the 2D optical
flow into camera flow and motion flow, as shown in Figure 1(b). The camera flow comes from the
camera ego-motion, while the motion flow comes from the motion of dynamic objects. We use the
motion flow to directly constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians (i.e., Gaussian flow). Since the
calculation of Gaussian flow is directly implemented in the CUDA-based rasterizer, this process is
differentiable and efficient. In the camera pose refinement module, we first fix the 3D Gaussians
and then utilize photometric consistency loss to backpropagate gradients to camera poses, thereby
alternately optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera poses to further enhance the rendering quality.

To sum up, our main contributions are as follows:

• We propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian framework called MotionGS, which provides
explicit motion guidance for deformable 3DGS and achieves high-quality dynamic scene
reconstruction with real-time rendering.
• The proposed optical flow decoupling module effectively separates the flow caused solely
by object motion, thereby efficiently supervising the deformation of 3D Gaussians. The

proposed pose refinement module alternately optimizes 3DGS and camera poses, reducing
reliance on accurate camera poses and further boosting rendering quality.
• Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results
on the NeRF-DS and HyperNeRF datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Novel-View Synthesis (NVS)

Novel view synthesis has been a hot research topic in the field of computer vision and graphics in
recent years. NeRF [9], which represents 3D scene by neural radiance fields, first achieves high-
resolution photorealistic results in this field. Despite many subsequent works [23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31] have been proposed to improve its efficiency and quality, NeRF-based methods still
struggle to render high-quality images with real-time rendering speed. Recently, by modeling 3D
scenes using a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussian with an efficient rasterizer, 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) [10] has shown remarkable performance with real-time rendering. Compared to NeRF, 3DGS
is an explicit 3D scene representation method with better scalability and editability. Therefore, it has
been rapidly extended to other 3D vision tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction [32, 33, 34, 35],
3D generation [36, 37, 38, 39, 40], scene editing [41, 42, 43] and SLAM [44, 45, 46, 47].

2.2
Dynamic Scene Reconstruction

In recent years, various dynamic scene reconstruction approaches have been proposed, which can be
broadly categorized into NeRF-based and 3DGS-based methods. NeRF-based works [48, 1, 49, 2,
4, 50, 51, 5] usually map dynamic scenes to a canonical space and render images based on this 3D
canonical space. This kind of 4D scene representation is intuitive but requires a well-reconstructed
canonical space. Other works propose to use time-varying NeRFs [6, 3, 52, 53, 54] or explicit
representations [55, 56, 7, 8, 57, 58, 59] to represent and render dynamic scenes. However, all
these NeRF-based methods require frequent point sampling or MLP queries, suffering from long
training and rendering time. With the proposal of 3DGS, many works [16, 21, 15, 11, 13, 17, 12,
60, 14, 61, 62, 63] use 3DGS as the fundamental model for 4D scene representation. For instance,
D-3DGS [11] models dynamic scenes by allowing the positions and rotation matrixes of 3DGS to
change over time. Deformable 3DGS [17] uses an MLP to model a deformation field based on
time and the canonical Gaussian space. SC-GS [15] bounds dense 3DGS with sparse control points,
calculating the movement of Gaussians in a coarse-to-fine manner. Despite they have performed
impressive rendering quality in some dynamic scenes, they lack explicit motion guidance to constrain
the movement of Gaussian, resulting in degraded performance in more complex dynamic scenes.
Recent works [21, 22] compose the movement of 3D points through their corresponding Gaussians,
using 2D flow priors to supervise the deformation of 3DGS. Inspired by them, we decompose the
optical flow to obtain more direct motion supervision, thus achieving higher rendering quality.

2.3
NVS with Pose Optimization

Several NVS works [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70] have noticed that it is difficult to derive precise camera
poses of input images in the real world, so they address novel view synthesis together with camera
pose optimization. i-NeRF [64] initially estimates camera poses by matching the input images. Other
methods such as NeRFmm [65] and Nope-NeRF [69] use monocular depth priors as guidance to do
the joint optimization of NeRF and camera poses. Recently, CF-3DGS [70] proposes progressive
reconstruction and leverages photometric loss to learn the affine transformation of Gaussians to
optimize the camera pose. However, these methods are mostly effective only for static scenes and
lack support for dynamic scenes. Motivated by these methods, we aim to extend 3DGS to dynamic
scenes with pose optimization, thus boosting the rendering quality and robustness.

3.1
3D Gaussian Splatting

As an explicit 3D representation similar to point clouds, 3DGS models the scene with a set of 3D
Gaussians. However, different from point clouds, each 3D Gaussian in the scene has its own opacity
o ∈[0, 1], center position µ ∈R3×1, and covariance matrix Σ ∈R3×3. These properties determine
the contribution and influence range of 3D Gaussians on rendering. For a position x ∈R3×1 in 3D
space, the corresponding contribution of a 3D Gaussian on it can be formulated as:

G(x) = o · e−1

2 (x−µ)⊤Σ−1(x−µ).
(1)

For differentiable optimization, the covariance matrix Σ can be decomposed into a scaling matrix S
and a rotation matrix R: Σ = RSST RT , where scaling matrix S = diag([sx, sy, sz]) and rotation
matrix R can be transformed from a quaternion [rw, rx, ry, rz]. Then the 3D Gaussians can be splatted
to a 2D camera plane through differential gaussian splatting. Specially, given a viewing transform
matrix W and the Jacobian matrix J of the affine approximation of the projective transformation, we
can obtain the 2D covariance matrix Σ2D through: Σ2D = JWΣW T JT . Similarly, we can obtain
the 2D center position µ2D of 3D Gaussians in camera plane. Therefore, given a 2D pixel p, the
rendering contribution of a 3D Gaussian on the viewpoint W can be obtained through a 2D version
of (1). To model the appearance of 3D Gaussians, spherical harmonics (SH) are introduced to define
the color c. Finally, for each pixel, the rendering results of 3DGS can be derived by calculating the
color contribution of all the related Gaussians. This process is known as α-blending:

C =

where ci, αi represent the color and density computed from the i-th 3D Gaussian.

3.2
Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting

To extend 3DGS to dynamic scenes, an intuitive approach is to utilize a learnable deformation field
to fit the movement of objects in the real world through Gaussian deformation. This idea originates
from NeRF-based methods such as D-NeRF [1] and has been effectively applied to 3DGS in recent
works [17, 13]. In these deformable 3DGS methods, a deformation network D is typically used
to model the movement of the center position of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, due to the inherent
properties of 3D Gaussians, the deformation network D may also consider the rotation and scaling
factors of 3D Gaussians as they vary over time. Therefore, the deformation of 3D Gaussians can be
formulated as:
(µ + ∆µ, r + ∆r, s + ∆s) = D(µ, r, s, t),
(3)
where t is the timestamp, µ, r, s are the center position, rotation quaternion and scaling factors of
3D Gaussians, and ∆µ, ∆r, ∆s are their residuals, respectively. Due to the various implementations
of deformable 3DGS, in this paper we focus solely on the deformation aspect without discussing
the other designs and specific differences in these works. We select method [17] as our baseline,
leveraging explicit motion guidance and camera pose refinement to further enhance the rendering
quality and the robustness in dynamic scenes.

Methodology

In this section, we first introduce the overall architecture of our approach in Section 4.1. Then the
optical flow decoupling module is introduced to derive motion guidance for Gaussian deformation
in Section 4.2. The camera pose refinement module is introduced to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians
and camera poses in Section 4.3. Finally, the overall loss function is introduced in Section 4.4.

4.1
Overall Architecture

The overall architecture of our method is illustrated in Figure 2. Our method primarily focuses on
the reconstruction of monocular dynamic scenes. Firstly, following 3DGS [10], we initialize camera
poses and 3D Gaussians using COLMAP [71]. Given two adjacent frames It and It+1, we compute
forward optical flow Ft→t+1 using an off-the-shelf flow estimation network. Meanwhile, we can
obtain the rendered depth map Dt of frame It at time t through the rasterizer. By feeding the depth

prior; (2) The 3D data stream involves the deformation and transformation of Gaussians to render the
image for the next frame. During training, we alternately optimize 3DGS and camera poses through
the camera pose refinement module.

map It, camera poses Ct, Ct+1, and optical flow priors Ft→t+1 into the optical flow decoupling
module, we can calculate the motion flow F M
t→t+1 solely related to object movement. After predicting
the deformation of Gaussians through the deformation network D, we obtain the state of 3D Gaussians
at time t + 1 and render the Gaussian flow F G
t→t+1 from time t to t + 1 under the assumption of a
stationary camera viewpoint for the frame It. The motion flow should be consistent with the Gaussian
flow, thus providing explicit motion guidance to Gaussian deformation. Additionally, since the
initialized camera poses may be inaccurate, we add a small residual ∆T to the relative camera pose
T. Leveraging the proposed camera pose refinement module, we cleverly backpropagate gradients to
the camera poses, achieving refinement of the camera poses. During training, we alternately optimize
3D Gaussian and camera poses to enhance the rendering quality and robustness in dynamic scenes.

4.2
Optical Flow Decoupling Module

To provide explicit motion guidance for the deformation of Gaussians, we first utilize an off-the-shelf
optical flow network to predict 2D motion priors. Since optical flow is influenced by both camera
movement and object motion, we decompose it into camera flow and motion flow as illustrated
in the Figure 1(b). Camera flow represents the optical flow caused solely by camera movement,
assuming the objects in the scene remain stationary. In contrast, motion flow considers the camera as
stationary, capturing only the movement of the objects. Essentially, optical flow can be viewed as the
vector sum of these two components. By decoupling them, we can effectively isolate object motion,
providing precise guidance for Gaussian deformation.

Camera flow and motion flow.
We use a schematic diagram Figure 3 to illustrate the detailed
calculation process. Camera flow can be directly computed from the camera poses and the depth of
the current frame. Specifically, at the timestamp t, we obtain the depth map Dt corresponding to
frame It directly from 3D Gaussians through the rasterizer. Given the intrinsics Kt and extrinsics Tt
of camera Ct, we can reproject point pt from frame It to 3D space using its depth Dt:

xt = T −1
t
K−1
t
Dt˜pt,
(4)
where ˜pt is the homogeneous coordinate of pt. Assuming xt does not move, we can obtain the
projection pt+1
t
of xt on frame It+1:

pt+1
t
= proj(Kt+1Tt+1xt),
(5)
where Kt+1 and Tt+1 are the intrinsics and extrinsics of camera Ct+1, proj() projects the 3D
coordinates to 2D image planes by dividing the last dimension (depth). Then the camera flow can be

(6)
which indicates the flow caused solely by camera movement. As the point xt moves over time, we
denote its updated position as xt+1. This new point xt+1 is then projected onto frame It+1 as pt+1.
Thus, the optical flow Ft→t+1 between two adjacent frame is defined as pt+1 −pt. Finally, the
motion flow F M
t→t+1 is derived by subtracting the camera flow from the optical flow:

F M
t→t+1 = Ft→t+1 −F C
t→t+1 = pt+1 −pt+1
t
,
(7)

which also corresponds to the optical flow caused by object movement at a fixed viewpoint.

Gaussion flow.
To establish a correspondence between Gaussian deformation and motion flow, we
need to splat the Gaussian deformation onto the 2D image plane, which is not implemented in the
original 3DGS framework. Inspired by recent work [21], we introduce the concept of Gaussian flow,
denoted as F G
t→t+1, to describe the 2D projection of Gaussian deformation, and implement it in the
CUDA-based rasterizer. The core idea is to model the contribution of Gaussians to the optical flow
by first transforming 3D Gaussians to canonical Gaussian space and then transforming them back to
the state at the next time step. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for the specific derivation and modeling
process of Gaussian flow. Gao et al. [21] computes the deformation of 3D Gaussians from time t to
t + 1 under the transformation of the camera viewpoint from Ct to Ct+1, corresponding to optical
flow. Different from it, our Gaussian flow is designed to match the motion flow, representing the
deformation of 3D Gaussians from time t to t + 1 fixed under the camera viewpoint Ct+1.

Flow loss.
To effective constrain the Gaussian deformation, we use a L1 loss between motion flow
and Gaussian flow for simplicity:

Lflow =
sg(F M
t→t+1) −F G
t→t+1
 ,
(8)

where sg() means stop gradient. Note that we also stop the gradients of all variables at time t in the
calculation of Gaussian flow for more efficient training.

Discussion.
The benefits of decoupling the optical flow are evident. Since motion flow is only
related to object motion, it can directly provide motion guidance. More importantly, in some previous
works [4, 54, 6], an off-the-shelf segmentation network is often used to segment out the dynamic
objects in the scene (such as humans, animals, cars, etc.). However, such masks are only used in
their photometric loss to mask out dynamic regions. In contrast, our motion flow benefits from these
dynamic masks more directly. By masking static objects with these masks, we can obtain a clear
motion flow for supervising Gaussian deformation. If optical flow is used as motion guidance, this
advantage will no longer exist because static objects can also contribute to the optical flow.

4.3
Camera Pose Refinement Module

In monocular dynamic scenes, due to the complexity of motion and sparsity of observations, even
widely used methods like COLMAP [71] cannot accurately estimate camera poses. Since the
optimization of 3DGS requires precise camera poses as input, it often performs poorly in complex

6


---Page Break---
dynamic scenes. Existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction methods rarely take this into
account. Inspired by pose-free optimization methods for static scene reconstruction [72, 70], we
design the camera pose refinement module. By alternately optimizing 3D Gaussian primitives and
camera poses during training, we improve the rendering quality of 3DGS and its robustness in
dynamic scenes.

Iterative training.
Since the supervision of 3DGS primarily relies on photometric consistency
loss, simultaneously optimizing camera parameters and 3DGS can be considered a chicken-and-egg
problem. Therefore, similar to Bundle Adjustment, we adopt an alternating optimization strategy to
train the model. Specifically, assuming Gt is the Gaussian at time t, we first predict the deformation
of the Gaussian using the deformation field D. We denote the deformed Gaussian as Gt+1
t
. Since
the observation viewpoint changes from time t to t + 1, Gt+1
t
needs to be transformed once again
under the camera Ct+1 to render frame It+1. We denote the transformed Gaussian as Gt+1. This
transformation process actually corresponds to camera motion. To achieve differentiable optimization,
we introduce a small residual ∆T into the relative pose T from camera viewpoint Ct to Ct+1,
treating it as a learnable SE(3) transformation. With this small change, we enable gradients to
backpropagate to the camera poses. During the optimization of camera poses, we freeze all attributes
of 3D Gaussians to improve training stability and robustness. Then we update the camera poses
initialized by COLMAP with the optimized relative camera poses, achieving global pose refinement.

Discussion.
While several methods have been proposed for pose-free optimization in static scenes,
dynamic scenes present greater challenges due to their inherently under-constrained nature. As a
result, to ensure stable and robust optimization, our approach still leverages camera poses computed
by COLMAP as an initialization step. This also necessitates the presence of sufficient static features
in the scene. Fortunately, static features are commonly found in most real-world environments,
particularly in background regions.

4.4
Optimization

Thanks to the integration of optical flow rendering and camera pose gradient computation in our
rasterization process, the overall training pipeline of our method is end-to-end differentiable. The
overall training loss is given by:
L = Lbaseline + λLflow,
(9)
where Lbaseline is the photometric loss used in our baseline [17], λ is the weight of our flow loss.

Experimental Setup

To highlight the abilities of our method in handling complex dynamic scenes, we select two repre-
sentative monocular dynamic scene datasets for evaluation: NeRF-DS [73] and HyperNeRF [49].
Our implementation is mainly based on PyTorch. We use a simple Adam [74] optimizer to adjust
the rotation increment and translation increment of the camera, and the learning rates of the two are
set to 3e-3 and 1e-1, respectively. The entire training process requires 20,000 iterations. We set λ
to 0.5 for NeRF-DS and 0.1 for HyperNeRF scene. The rest of the settings are consistent with the
baseline method [17]. All experiments are performed on a single Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU. For more
implementation details, please refer to Appendix A.2.

Results

Following previous methods, we use metrics PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS for evaluation. For more
visualizations, please refer to Appendix A.4.

and sharp edges of the moving plate while significantly reducing visual distortions such as floating

artifacts. Similarly, in the basin scene, our method effectively models the smooth surface of the basin,
in contrast to other methods that result in a bumpy basin bottom. This is mainly because our proposed
framework can provide accurate and effective motion guidance for Gaussian deformation.

Results on the HyperNeRF dataset.
For scenes captured in the wild using smartphones, Table 2
summarizes the relevant performance comparison results. Our method also achieves consistent
performance improvements in these scenarios. Qualitatively, our approach excels at accurately recon-
structing scene geometry and appearance, even under irregular camera movements and inaccurate
camera poses. For instance (see Figures 6 and 13), in the chicken scene, our method captures the
subtle bumps on the red shell, while in the broom scene, it accurately renders the details of the broom
in fast movement. This is mainly attributed to the motion guidance and camera pose refinement
proposed by our method, both of which enhance the rendering performance of the baseline method.

Ablation Study

In this section, we conduct ablations on the NeRF-DS dataset to validate the effectiveness of the key
components of our method, as shown in Table 3. For more ablations, please refer to Appendix A.3.

Effectiveness of the optical flow decoupling module.
To illustrate the necessity of optical flow
decoupling module, we conduct ablations using direct optical flow supervision instead of decoupled
motion flow constraints. As shown in the row 2 of Table 3, directly using optical flow to supervise
Gaussian motion even results in a performance decline compared to the baseline. This performance
drop is likely due to the inherent ambiguity created by the mixed camera and object movements.
When camera and object movements are not separated, the supervision signal becomes noisy and less

effective. This ambiguity hampers the optimization process of 3DGS, thereby reducing the motion
modeling capabilities of the deformation field. In contrast, we use motion flow as supervision, which
effectively provides explicit motion guidance for Gaussian deformation, thereby better modeling
complex dynamic scenes. As shown in Figures 7 and 14, only the motion flow can clearly highlights
movement information in dynamic regions. This explicit motion information efficiently constrains
the Gaussian flow, ensuring that the motion guidance remains consistent and effective.

Effectiveness of the camera pose refinement module.
Leveraging the alternating optimization of
3DGS and camera poses, our approach adaptively corrects potential errors in camera poses. Further-
more, the updated camera poses contribute to more accurate camera flow, thus improving the accuracy
of motion guidance. In row 4 of Table 3, our camera pose refinement module, built upon motion
guidance, yields substantial performance gains for the model. This iterative optimization process
enhances the robustness of our model in complex dynamic scenes. For instance, in the HyperNeRF

dataset, our method reconstructs more plausible results compared to the baseline approach. Unlike
static scene datasets (e.g., Tanks & Temples) that use COLMAP to obtain the ground truth of camera
poses, we assume that COLMAP may not provide accurate poses for dynamic scene datasets. In this
setting, we lack ground truth for a direct quantitative evaluation for refined camera pose. Therefore,
we provide visualizations of the pose refinement process in the Figure 8 as qualitative comparison.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose MotionGS, a novel deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for
explicitly modeling and constraining object motion in dynamic scene reconstruction. The proposed
framework includes two key modules: the optical flow decoupling module and the camera poserefine-
ment module. The optical flow decoupling module decouples the motion flow related solely to object
motion from the optical flow priors, providing explicit supervision for Gaussian deformation. The
camera pose refinement module alternately optimizes 3DGS and camera poses, further enhancing the
rendering quality and robustness of our model in dynamic scenes. Quantitative and qualitative results
on the NeRF-DS and HyperNeRF datasets strongly demonstrate the contributions and effectiveness
of our proposed method. More importantly, the proposed improvements are agnostic to specific
network designs, which can be applied to similar deformation-based 3DGS methods. In future work,
we aim to develop a 3DGS method that does not rely on camera pose inputs, thereby achieving robust
high-quality reconstruction in dynamic scenes.

Figure 9: The formulation of Gaussian flow. We first project the point xt corresponding to the i-th
Gaussian at time t into the canonical Gaussian space, and then reproject this point from the canonical
Gaussian space to the i-th Gaussian at time t + 1.

Motivated by [21], we formulate the Gaussian flow F G
t→t+1 to simulate the motion of dynamic object
in the scene, as shown in Figure 9 Specifically, Gaussian flow corresponds to the deformation of 3D
Gaussians from time t to t + 1 in the camera viewpoint Ct+1. For point xt, we first transform it to
the canonical space 3 corresponding to the Gaussian at time t:

ˆxt = Σ−1
i,t (xt −µi,t),
(10)

where µi,t and Σi,t are the center position and covariance matrix of i-th Gaussian at the timestamp t.
Then we transform ˆxt back to the Gaussian at the next time step t + 1:
xi,t+1 = Σi,t+1ˆxt + µi,t,
(11)
where µi,t+1 and Σi,t+1 are the center position and covariance matrix of i-th Gaussian at the
timestamp t + 1. Therefore, the flow contribution from i-th Gaussian to this point can be defined as:

F G
i,t→t+1 = xi,t+1 −xt.
(12)
Finally, all Gaussian flow contributions to the point can be accumulated in a similar way to α-
blendering:

F G
t→t+1 =

K
X

i=1
wiF G
i,t→t+1
(13)

=

K
X

i=1
wi(xi,t+1 −xt),
(14)

where wi is the weight of α-blendering. Note that since the computation of forward optical flow is
referenced to frame It, the Gaussian flow should be consistently rendered under the camera viewpoint
Ct, corresponding to the decoupled motion flow. It represents the 2D splatting of the Gaussian
deformation field from time t to t + 1 when the camera viewpoint remains unchanged.

Datasets.
The NeRF-DS dataset consists of eight stereo camera video sequences of daily scenes.
These scenes contain high-speed moving high-gloss surface objects and changing camera poses,
which pose challenges for dynamic scene modeling. The HyperNeRF dataset includes additional
complications such as topological changes and inaccurate camera poses. For the NeRF-DS dataset,
we use the default resolution 480×270 for all scenes for training and testing. We train the model
using images from the left camera and test it on the right camera. For the HyperNeRF dataset, we
select four sets of scenes in the vrig subset (3D Printer, Chicken, Broom, and Banana) for training
and testing, with 2× downsampling resolution of 536 × 960.

3The canonical space mentioned here should not be confused with the canonical space in the Gaussian
deformation field. It represents the standard Gaussian distribution space.

Implementation details.
To achieve the differentiable Gaussian flow and differentiable camera
pose, we integrate the forward and backward processes into our rasterizer. To provide reliable
optical flow, we choose GMFlow [20] as the default optical flow network. In order to stabilize the
initialization process of the scene, we introduce motion constraints only after the Gaussian starts
to deform and move. In the NeRF-DS dataset, we set the weight of the flow loss λ to 0.5; while in
the HyperNeRF scene, it is set to 0.1. Camera pose optimization is also only activated during the
Gaussian deformation stage.

Data sampling mechanism.
We adopt the same data sampling strategy as the baseline method,
i.e., reading image sequences in a randomly shuffled order. For an N-frame video, the frames are
shuffled and then read sequentially. In each iteration, we read two frames and calculate the optical
flow between them. To enhance efficiency, the second image from the last iteration is used as the
first image in the current iteration. Thus, except for the first iteration, only one new image is read
in each subsequent iteration. Consequently, there are N −1 iterations per epoch, with optical flow
computed once in each iteration. This strategy balances the introduction of accurate motion priors
with maintaining training efficiency. During the first epoch of training, we calculate the optical flow
for all adjacent frame pairs, resulting in a total of N −1 optical flow maps. In subsequent epochs,
we do not reshuffle the image sequence, allowing us to reuse the optical flow maps calculated in
the first epoch. This effectively eliminates the need to recompute optical flow maps in each epoch,
significantly reducing computational overhead.

Training time and GPU memory.
For model training, we list the training time per scene and peak
memory usage on the NeRF-DS dataset as shown in Tables 4 and 5, providing a comprehensive
assessment of resource usage during training. Compared to our baseline, our approach incurs
increased training time and peak memory usage. This is primarily due to the additional rendering of
Gaussian flow and the refinement of camera poses, which are necessary for our method.

FPS, number of 3D Gaussians and storage.
We provide statistics of FPS and number of Gaussians
on NeRF-DS dataset, as shown in Table 6. In most scenes of NeRF-DS, our method MotionGS
achieves real-time rendering (FPS>30).

A.3
More Ablations

We summarize the ablations on other choices of our proposed framework in Table 7. For fair
comparison, we do not activate the proposed camera pose refinement module during training, since it
also influences the flow calculation. Our interpretation and analysis of the ablations are as follows.

Effectiveness of motion mask (row 2).
Introducing a motion mask allows the motion flow to focus
on the motion of dynamic objects, thereby reducing interference from static areas. When the motion
mask is removed, the performance declines. We attribute this degradation to inaccurate optical flow
in the background areas, which introduces errors in the motion guidance and subsequently leads to
incorrect Gaussian deformations.

Different depth choice (row 3).
Estimating the accurate depth maps for depth warping is a critical
issue when calculating camera flow. We find that using depth prediction from offline estimator
Midas [77] yields suboptimal results. This approach degrades the quality of subsequent motion flow,
reducing the accuracy of motion constraints and ultimately impacting the reconstruction quality.
We attribute this degradation to the inherent scale ambiguity [79] in the depth estimator, as shown
in Figure 10. In contrast, using rendered depth by 3DGS ensures scale and geometric consistency and
provides superior detail.

Ours
MiDas

Figure 10: Rendered depth from 3D Gaussian splatting (ours) and off-the-shelf monocular
depth estimator (MiDas). Our rendered depth has richer details and is scale-aligned with the scene.
MiDas rendered depth is usually more smooth and suffers from scale ambiguity.

Different optical flow network (row 4-5).
Our method relies on existing 2D optical flow estimators
to provide motion guidance for the 3D Gaussian fields. The choice of optical flow prior can
lead to performance differences. When we replace GMFlow [20] with another supervised method
FlowFormer [19], the performance deteriorates. This is mainly due to the fact that FlowFormer
performs inadequately in the "plate" scene, resulting in an overall performance decrease. Additionally,
when we replace GMFlow [20] with a self-supervised method MDFlow [78], the performance is

17


---Page Break---
even worse. This phenomenon may also illustrates the importance of accurate motion priors, while
erroneous or noisy motion constraints may even have a negative effect on the optimization.

Self-supervised flow supervision loss (row 6).
Inspired by self-supervised optical flow estimation
methods, we attempt to provide motion priors in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we estimate
the Gaussian flow corresponding to the optical flow and use it to warp the It frame. We then compute
the photometric loss with the It+1 frame. As shown in the table, this method outperforms our baseline
but is less effective compared to our proposed method. We hypothesize that the discrepancy arises
because the self-supervised loss may not provide accurate supervision in areas with similar colors.
Nevertheless, it is evident that employing self-supervised optical flow loss can reduce dependence on
off-the-shelf optical flow estimation. When an optical flow estimation network is either unavailable
or inaccurate, this approach can serve as a valuable alternative to improve rendering quality.

Different flow loss weights (row 7-8).
We compare the rendering performance under different
flow loss weights. The results indicate that the selected weight (λ = 0.5) achieves the best rendering
quality. We speculate that excessively large loss weights may disrupt the original optimization process
based on rendering losses, while too small weights may result in insufficient motion guidance.

Figure 11: Failure case in DyNeRF dataset. Since the viewpoints are fixed and sparse, neither
motion flow nor optical flow can help our method avoid floating artifacts.

During our experiments, we identify several unresolved issues. Specifically, when applying our
method to the DyNeRF dataset [80], we encounter significant challenges as illustrated in Figure 11.
Upon further analysis, we find that the fixed and sparse camera viewpoints in the DyNeRF dataset
hinder accurate depth rendering, affecting subsequent camera flow calculations and leading to artifacts.
The inaccuracies in motion flow primarily comes from the inaccuracy of the camera flow, rather
than a failure of the optical flow estimation itself. It is also important to clarify that the DyNeRF
dataset is not continuous monocular video but rather dynamic scenes with sparse viewpoints, which
posed challenges to the canonical 3D Gaussian initialization. Moving forward, our focus will
be on addressing these issues to further improve the robustness of our model in dynamic scene
reconstruction. We aim to develop more stable and reliable motion priors and adapt our approach to
handle scenarios with minimal object movement more effectively. By doing so, we hope to extend
the applicability and reliability of our method across a wider range of dynamic scenes.

A.6
Broader Impacts

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method will not have significant negative social impact.
The proposed dynamic reconstruction method can be used to reconstruct and render some daily
dynamic scenes. Users can use the video shot by their mobile phones as input to obtain an explicit 3D
asset represented by a 3D Gaussian and a deformation field. This 3D asset can be used for subsequent
editing, development, secondary creation for entertainment.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We state the main contributions of this paper and the differences from previous
methods in both the abstract and introduction sections.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix A.5 for the discussion of limitations and failure cases.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

22


---Page Break---
Justification: We provide the necessary formulas and related explanations in the main text.
Please see refer to Appendix A.1 for the derivation of Gaussian flow.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We identify our baseline method and explain the implementation details where
we differ from the baseline method in Section 5.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

23


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The datasets and baseline methods in this paper are publicly available. Our
source code will be openly accessible after the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided necessary implementation details in Section 5.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We follow the experimental settings of previous works to conduct experiments.
Therefore, the comparison with previous works is fair.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the information of our computer resources in Section 5.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We ensure that our experiments comply with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in all
respects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to our discussion on broader impacts in Appendix A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

25


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks for misuse of released data or models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have appropriately cited related work and abide by their licenses and terms.
Please refer to Appendix A.7.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

26


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

27


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
