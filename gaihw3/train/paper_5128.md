Abstract

In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RETNET) as a foundation architecture
1

for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost
2

inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between
3

recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence
4

modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent,
5

and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training
6

parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost O(1) inference, which
7

improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing
8

performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-
9

sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly
10

while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language
11

modeling show that RETNET achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training,
12

low-cost deployment, and efficient inference.

Introduction
14

Transformer [51] has become the de facto architecture for large language models, which was initially
15

proposed to overcome the sequential training issue of recurrent models [25]. However, training
16

parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the O(N) complexity per
17

step and memory-bound key-value cache [42], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment.
18

The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces
19

inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming
20

at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient
21

O(1) inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously.
22

There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [27, 37] approximates
23

standard attention scores exp(q · k) with kernels ϕ(q) · ϕ(k), so that autoregressive inference can
24

be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than
25

Transformers, which hinders the method’s popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models
26

for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators [36]
27

are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third
28

line explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S4 [20], and its variants [11, 38].
29

None of the previous work can achieve strong performance and efficient inference at the same time
30

compared to Transformers.
31

In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient long-
32

sequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultane-
33

ously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention,
34

which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent repre-
35

sentations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices
36

fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient O(1) inference in terms of memory
37

and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the
38

implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent

representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block
40

for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory.
41

We compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling
42

show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning.
43

Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8k sequence
44

length, RetNet decodes 8.4× faster and saves 70% of memory than Transformers with key-value
45

caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 3× acceleration than standard Transformer with
46

highly-optimized FlashAttention-2 [10]. Besides, RetNet’s inference latency is insensitive to batch
47

size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a potential candidate to
48

replace Transformer for large language models.

Retentive Network
50

Retentive network (RetNet) is stacked with L identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e.,
51

residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [51]. Each RetNet block contains two
52

modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We
53

introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence x = x1 · · · x|x|,
54

RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors {xi}|x|
i=1 is first packed
55

into X0 = [x1, · · · , x|x|] ∈R|x|×dmodel, where dmodel is hidden dimension. Then we compute
56

contextualized vector representations Xl = RetNetl(Xl−1), l ∈[1, L].
57

2.1
Retention
58

In this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and
59

parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference.
60

Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps v(n) 7→o(n) through states sn. Let vn, on denote
61

v(n), o(n) for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:
62

sn = Asn−1 + K⊺
nvn,
A ∈Rd×d,
Kn ∈R1×d

on = Qnsn =

n
X

m=1
QnAn−mK⊺
mvm,
Qn ∈R1×d
(1)

where we map vn to the state vector sn, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence
63

information recurrently. Next, we make the projection Qn, Kn content-aware:
64

Q = XWQ,
K = XWK
(2)

where WQ, WK ∈Rd×d are learnable matrices.
65

We diagonalize the matrix A = Λ(γeiθ)Λ−1, where γ, θ ∈Rd.
Then we obtain An−m =
66

Λ(γeiθ)n−mΛ−1. By absorbing Λ into WQ and WK, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:
67

on =

n
X

m=1
Qn(γeiθ)n−mK⊺
mvm

=

n
X

m=1
(Qn(γeiθ)n)(Km(γeiθ)−m)⊺vm

(3)

where Qn(γeiθ)n, Km(γeiθ)−m is known as xPos [45], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed
68

for Transformer. We further simplify γ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:
69

on =

n
X

m=1
γn−m(Qneinθ)(Kmeimθ)†vm
(4)

where † is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances.
70

In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel
71

formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping v(n) 7→o(n) as vectors and obtain
72

the retention mechanism as follows.

Figure 1: RetNet has three equivalent computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise
recurrent representations. Given the same input, three paradigms obtain the same output. “GN” is
short for GroupNorm.

The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 1a, the retention layer is defined as:
74

Q = (XWQ) ⊙Θ,
K = (XWK) ⊙Θ,
V = XWV

Θn = einθ,
Dnm =
γn−m,
n ≥m
0,
n < m
Retention(X) = (QK⊺⊙D)V

(5)

where D ∈R|x|×|x| combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one
75

matrix, and Θ is the complex conjugate of Θ. In practice, we map Q, K ∈Rd →Cd/2, add the
76

complex position embedding Θ, then map them back to Rd, following the implementation trick as in
77

LLaMA [48, 44]. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models
78

with GPUs efficiently.
79

The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 1b, the proposed mechanism can
80

also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the n-th
81

timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:
82

Sn = γSn−1 + K⊺
nVn
Retention(Xn) = QnSn,
n = 1, · · · , |x|
(6)

where Q, K, V, γ are the same as in Equation (5).
83

The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention
A hybrid form of parallel representation
84

and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We
85

divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation
86

(Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the
87

recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let B denote the chunk length. We compute the
88

retention output of the i-th chunk via:
89

Q[i] = QBi:B(i+1),
K[i] = KBi:B(i+1),
V[i] = VBi:B(i+1)
Ri = K⊺

between recurrent representation and chunkwise recurrent representation is described in Appendix B.

Gated Multi-Scale Retention

We use h = dmodel/d retention heads in each layer, where d is the head dimension. The heads use

different parameter matrices WQ, WK, WV ∈Rd×d. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns

Chunkwise retention combines the above advantages (i.e., parallel within each chunk and recurrent
across chunks), which has linear memory complexity for long sequences.

different γ for each head. For simplicity, we set γ identical among different layers and keep them
95

fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [23, 40] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers.
96

Formally, given input X, we define the layer as:
97

γ = 1 −2−5−arange(0,h) ∈Rh

headi = Retention(X, γi)
Y = GroupNormh(Concat(head1, · · · , headh))
MSR(X) = (swish(XWG) ⊙Y )WO

(8)

where WG, WO ∈Rdmodel×dmodel are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [53] normalizes the
98

output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [43]. Notice that the heads use multiple γ scales,
99

which results in different variance statistics. So we normalize the head outputs separately.
100

The pseudocode of retention is summarized in Figure 2.
101

Retention Score Normalization We utilize the scale-invariant nature of GroupNorm to improve the
102

numerical precision of retention layers. Specifically, multiplying a scalar value within GroupNorm
103

does not affect outputs and backward gradients, i.e., GroupNorm(α∗headi) = GroupNorm(headi).
104

We implement three normalization factors in Equation (5). First, we normalize QK⊺as QK⊺/
√

d.
105

Second, we replace D with ˜Dnm = Dnm/√Pn
i=1 Dni. Third, let R denote the retention scores
106

R = QK⊺⊙D, we normalize it as ˜Rnm = Rnm/max(Pn
i=1 |Rni|,1). Then the retention output
107

becomes Retention(X) = ˜RV . The above tricks do not affect the final results while stabilizing the
108

numerical flow of both forward and backward passes, because of the scale-invariant property.
109

2.3
Overall Architecture of Retention Networks
110

For an L-layer retention network, we stack multi-scale retention (MSR) and feed-forward network
111

(FFN) to build the model. Formally, the input sequence {xi}|x|
i=1 is transformed into vectors by a
112

word embedding layer. We use the packed embeddings X0 = [x1, · · · , x|x|] ∈R|x|×dmodel as the
113

input and compute the model output XL:
114

Y l = MSR(LN(Xl)) + Xl

Xl+1 = FFN(LN(Y l)) + Y l
(9)

where LN(·) is LayerNorm [3]. The FFN part is computed as FFN(X) = gelu(XW1)W2, where
115

W1, W2 are parameter matrices.
116

---Page Break---
Training We use the parallel (Equation (5)) and chunkwise recurrent (Equation (7)) representations
117

during the training process. The parallelization within sequences or chunks efficiently utilizes
118

GPUs to accelerate computation. More favorably, chunkwise recurrence is especially useful for
119

long-sequence training, which is efficient in terms of both FLOPs and memory consumption.
120

Inference The recurrent representation (Equation (6)) is employed during inference, which nicely
121

fits autoregressive decoding. The O(1) complexity reduces memory and inference latency while
122

achieving equivalent results.
123

Experiments
124

We perform language modeling experiments to evaluate RetNet. First, we present the scaling curves
125

of Transformer and RetNet. Second, we follow the training settings of StableLM-4E1T [50] to
126

compare with open-source Transformer models in downstream benchmarks. Moreover, for training
127

and inference, we compare speed, memory consumption, and latency. The training corpus is a curated
128

compilation of The Pile [16], C4 [14], and The Stack [29].
129

3.1
Comparison with Transformer Variants
130

We compare RetNet with various efficient Transformer variants, including RWKV [36], H3 [11],
131

Hyena [38], and Mamba [19]. We use LLaMA [48] architecture, including RMSNorm [59] and
132

SwiGLU [40, 7] module, as the Transformer backbone, which shows better performance and stability.
133

Consequently, other variants follow these settings. Specifically, Mamba does not have FFN layers so
134

we only implement RMSNorm. For RetNet, the FFN intermediate dimension is 5

3d and the value
135

dimensions in WG, WV , WO are also 5

3d, where the overall parameters are still 12d2. All models
136

have 400M parameters with 24 layers and a hidden dimension of 1024. For H3, we set the head
137

dimension to 8. For RWKV, we use the TimeMix module to substitute self-attention layers while
138

keeping FFN layers consistent with other models for fair comparisons. We train the models with 40k
139

steps with a batch size of 0.25M tokens.
140

Fine-Grained Language Modeling Evaluation As shown in Table 1, we first report the language
141

modeling perplexity of validation sets. Besides the overall validation set, following [2], we divide
142

perplexity into “AR-Hit” and “First Occur”. Specifically, AR-Hit contains the predicted tokens that
143

are previously seen bigrams in the previous context, which evaluates the associative recall ability.
144

“First Occur” has the predicted tokens that can not be recalled from the context. Among various
145

Transformer variants, RetNet outperforms previous methods on both “AR-Hit” and “First Occur”
146

splits, which is important for real-world use cases.
147

Knowledge-Intensive Tasks
We also evaluate Massive Multitask Language Understanding
148

(MMLU; [24]) answer perplexity to evaluate models on knowledge-intensive tasks. We report
149

the average perplexity of the correct answers, i.e., given input [Question, “Answer:”, Correct
150

Answer], we calculate the perplexity of the “Correct Answer” part. RetNet achieves competitive
151

results among the architectures.

We train language models with various sizes (i.e., 1.3B,

2.7B, and 6.7B) from scratch. The training batch size
155

is 4M tokens with 2048 maximal length. We train the
156

models with 25k steps. The detailed hyper-parameters are
157

described in Appendix E. We train the models with 512
158

AMD MI200 GPUs.
159

Figure 3 reports perplexity on the validation set for the
160

language models based on Transformer and RetNet. We
161

present the scaling curves with three model sizes, i.e.,
162

1.3B, 2.7B, and 6.7B. RetNet achieves comparable results
163

with Transformers. More importantly, the results indicate
164

that RetNet is favorable in terms of size scaling. In addi-
165

tion to performance, RetNet training is quite stable in our
166

experiments. Experimental results show that RetNet is a
167

strong competitor to Transformer for large language mod-
168

els. Empirically, we find that RetNet starts to outperform
169

Transformer when the model size is larger than 2B.
170

3.3
Long-Context Evaluation
171

We evaluate long-context modeling on the ZeroSCROLLS [41] benchmark. We train a hybrid model
172

of size 2.7B, RetNet+, which stacks the attention and retention layers. Specifically, we insert one
173

attention layer after every 3 retention layers. We follow most configurations of the 2.7B model as in
174

Section 3.2. We scale the number of training tokens to 420B tokens. The batch size is 4M tokens.
175

We first train the model with 4K length and then extend the sequence length to 16K for the last 50B
176

training tokens. The rotation base scaling [55] is used for length extension.
177

Figure 4 reports the answer perplexity given various lengths of input document. It shows that both
178

Transformer and RetNet+ perform better with longer input documents. The results indicate that the
179

language models successfully utilize the long-distance context. Notice that the 12K and 16K results
180

in Qasper are similar because the lengths of most documents are shorter than 16K. Moreover, RetNet+
181

obtains competitive results compared with Transformer for long-context modeling. Meanwhile,
182

retention has better training and inference efficiency.

Inference Cost
184

As shown in Figure 5, we compare memory cost, throughput, and latency of Transformer and RetNet
185

during inference. Transformers reuse KV caches of previously decoded tokens. RetNet uses the
186

recurrent representation as described in Equation (6). We evaluate the 6.7B model on the A100-80GB
187

GPU. Figure 5 shows that RetNet outperforms Transformer in terms of inference cost.
188

Memory
As shown in Figure 5a, the memory cost of Transformer increases linearly due to KV
189

caches. In contrast, the memory consumption of RetNet remains consistent even for long sequences,

almost negligible (i.e., about 3%) while the model weights occupy 97%.
192

Throughput
As presented in Figure 5b, the throughput of Transformer drops along with the
193

decoding length increases. In comparison, RetNet has higher and length-invariant throughput during
194

decoding, by utilizing the recurrent representation of retention.
195

Latency
Latency is an important metric in deployment that greatly affects the user experience.
196

We report the decoding latency in Figure 5c. Experimental results show that increasing batch size
197

renders the Transformer’s latency larger. Moreover, the latency of Transformers grows faster with
198

longer input. In order to make latency acceptable, we have to restrict the batch size, which harms the
199

overall inference throughput of Transformers. By contrast, RetNet’s decoding latency outperforms
200

Transformers and stays almost the same across different batch sizes and input lengths.

for Transformers. In comparison, we implement chunk
208

recurrent representation (Equation (7)) using Triton [46],
209

where the computation is both memory-friendly and
210

computationally efficient. The chunk size is set to 256.
211

We evaluate the results with eight Nvidia H100-80GB
212

GPUs because FlashAttention-2 is highly optimized for
213

H100 cards.
214

Experimental results show that RetNet has higher train-
215

ing throughput than Transformers. The acceleration ratio increases as the sequence length is longer.
216

When the training length is 64k, RetNet’s throughput is about 3 times than Transformer’s.
217

3.6
Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Evaluation on Downstream Tasks
218

We also compare the language models on a wide range of downstream tasks. We evaluate zero-shot
219

and 4-shot learning with the 6.7B models. As shown in Table 2, the datasets include HellaSwag
220

(HS; [57]), BoolQ [8], COPA [52], PIQA [6], Winograd, Winogrande [30], and StoryCloze (SC; [34]).
221

The accuracy numbers are consistent with language modeling perplexity presented in Figure 3. RetNet
222

achieves comparable performance with Transformer on zero-shot and in-context learning settings.
223

3.7
Ablation Studies
224

We ablate various design choices of RetNet and report the language modeling results in Table 3. The
225

evaluation settings and metrics are the same as in Section 3.1.

Table 2: Zero-shot and few-shot learning performance. The language model size is 6.7B.

Architecture
We ablate the swish gate and GroupNorm as described in Equation (8). Table 3
227

shows that the above two components improve performance. First, the gating module is essential
228

for enhancing non-linearity and improving model capability. Notice that we use the same parameter
229

allocation as in Transformers after removing the gate. Second, group normalization in retention
230

balances the variances of multi-head outputs, which improves training stability and language modeling
231

results.
232

Multi-Scale Decay Equation (8) shows that we use different γ as the decay rates for the retention
233

heads. In the ablation studies, we examine removing γ decay (i.e., “−γ decay”) and applying the
234

same decay rate across heads (i.e., “−multi-scale decay”). Specifically, ablating γ decay is equivalent
235

to γ = 1. In the second setting, we set γ = 1 −2−6.5 for all heads. Table 3 indicates that both the
236

decay mechanism and using multiple decay rates can improve the language modeling performance.
237

Head Dimension As indicated by the recurrent perspective of Equation (1), the head dimension
238

implies the memory capacity of hidden states. In ablation, we reduce the default head dimension from
239

256 to 64, i.e., 64 for queries and keys, and ⌊5

3 ×64⌋≈108 for values. We keep the hidden dimension
240

dmodel the same. Accordingly, we adjust the multi-scale decay as γ = 1 −2−5−arange(0,h)/4 to keep
241

the same decay range. Table 3 shows that the larger head dimension achieves better performance.

Table 3: Perplexity results on language modeling and MMLU [24] answers. For language modeling,
we report perplexity on both the overall validation set and fine-grained diagnosis sets [2], i.e., “AR-Hit”
evaluates the associative recall capability, and “First-Occur” indicates the regular language modeling
performance. Besides, we evaluate the answer perplexity of the MMLU subsets.

3.8
Results on Vision Tasks
243

We also compare RetNet with vision Transformers [15, 47] in Table 4, where bidirectional en-
244

coders are evaluated. Unlike causal language models, the vision encoders do not require recurrent
245

representations. Specifically, we use retention as follows:
246

Q = (XWQ) ⊙Θ,
K = (XWK) ⊙Θ,
V = XWV
Retention(X) = (QK⊺)V = Q(K⊺V )

where multi-scale decay is removed in bidirectional computation. Notice that we can compute
247

retention in different orders. Similar to linear attention [27], the Q(K⊺V ) paradigm is an efficient
248

operator in bidirectional settings, especially for high-resolution images.
249

We perform experiments on ImageNet-1K classification [13], COCO object detection [32], and
250

ADE20K semantic segmentation [60]. We compare RetNet with DeiT [47] which is a well-tuned
251

vision Transformer. Besides, we follow [21] and plug in a depth-wise convolution in experiments.
252

We adopt the DeiT-M size, which has about 38M parameters. For ImageNet-1K image classification,

Table 4: Results on vision tasks, i.e., image classification (ImageNet), object detection (COCO), and
semantic segmentation (ADE20K). RetNet achieves competitive performance with DeiT, which is a
well-tuned vision Transformer.

we use AdamW [33] for 300 epochs, and 20 epochs of linear warm-up. The learning rate is 1 × 10−3,
254

the batch size is 1024, and the weight decay is 0.05. For COCO object detection, we use Mask
255

R-CNN [22] as the task head, and the above models pre-trained on ImageNet as the backbone with
256

3x schedules. In ADE20K experiments, we use UperNet [54] as the segmentation head. The detailed
257

configuration can be found in Appendix H.
258

Table 4 shows the results across various vision tasks. RetNet is competitive compared with DeiT.
259

For classification and segmentation, RetNet is slightly better than DeiT, where RetNet achieves
260

0.81% accuracy improvement on ImageNet and 0.61% mIoU improvement on ADE20K. For object
261

detection, the results are comparable.

Related Work
263

Numerous efforts are focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. Linear
264

attention [27] uses various kernels ϕ(qi)ϕ(kj)/P|x|
n=1 ϕ(qi)ϕ(kn) to replace the softmax function. In
265

contrast, we reexamine sequence modeling from scratch, rather than aiming at approximating
266

softmax. AFT [58] simplifies dot-product attention to element-wise and moves softmax to key
267

vectors. RWKV [36] replaces AFT’s position embeddings with exponential decay and runs the
268

models recurrently for training and inference. In comparison, retention preserves high-dimensional
269

states to encode sequence information, which contributes to expressive ability and better performance.
270

S4 [20] unifies convolution and recurrence format and achieves O(N log N) training complexity
271

leveraging the FFT kernel. Unlike Equation (2), if Qn and Kn are content-unaware, the formulation
272

can be degenerated to S4 [20]. Hyena [38] generates the convolution kernels, achieving sub-quadratic
273

training efficiency but keeping O(N) complexity in single-step inference. Recently, most related
274

work has focused on modifying γ in Equation (6) as a data-dependent variable, such as Mamba [19],
275

GLA [56], Gateloop [28], and xLSTM [4]. Another strand explores hybrid architectures [31, 12] that
276

interleave the above components with attention layers.
277

In addition, we discuss the training and inference efficiency of some related methods. Let D denote
278

the hidden dimension, H the head dimension, and N the sequence length. For training, RWKV’s
279

token-mixing complexity is O(DN), and Mamba’s complexity is O(DHN) with optimized CUDA
280

kernels. Hyena’s is O(DN log N) with Fast Fourier Transform acceleration. In comparison, the
281

chunk-wise recurrent representation is O(DN(B + H)), where B is the chunk size, and we usually
282

set H = 256, B ≤512. However, chunk-wise computation is highly parallelized, enabling efficient
283

hardware usage. For large model size (i.e., larger D) or sequence length, the additional b + h has
284

negligible effects. For inference, among the efficient architectures compared, Hyena has the same
285

complexity (i.e., O(N) per step) as Transformer, while the others can perform O(1) decoding.
286

Conclusion
287

We propose retentive networks (RetNet) for sequence modeling, which enables various representa-
288

tions, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. RetNet achieves significantly better inference
289

efficiency (in terms of memory, speed, and latency), favorable training parallelization, and competitive
290

performance compared with Transformers. The above advantages make RetNet an ideal successor to
291

Transformers for large language models, especially considering the deployment benefits brought by
292

the O(1) inference complexity. In the future, we are interested in deploying RetNet on various edge
293

devices, such as mobile phones.

A
Scaling Up Number of Training Tokens
464

We scale up the number of training tokens to 350B for the 3B-size models. We compare with strong
465

Transformer checkpoints including OpenLLaMA [18] and StableLM [50]. Moreover, we reproduce a
466

Transformer language model (named TransformerRepro) for apple-to-apple comparison.
467

Our model RetNet+ follows the same configuration as in Section 3.3, which is a hybrid model. The
468

model’s hidden size is 3072, and the number of layers is 28. Without vocabulary embedding, the total
469

number of parameters is 3.17B, which is between StableLM-3B-4E1T (2.7B) and OpenLLaMA-3B-
470

v1 (3.19B). The batch size is 4M tokens. The training length is 4k. The learning rate is 3.2 × 10−4
471

with 1000 warm-up steps and linear learning rate decay. The training corpus includes The Pile [16]
472

and RedPajama [9]. TransformerRepro follows the exact same setting.
473

Table 5 reports accuracy numbers on the Harness-Eval benchmark [17]. We directly follow the evalua-
474

tion protocol. The results show that RetNet+ achieves a performance comparable to TransformerRepro
475

on language tasks. Notice that OpenLLaMA-3B-v1 and StableLM-3B use different learning rate
476

schedules. The results of these two models are used for reference purposes.

B
Equivalence Between Chunk-wise Recurrent Representation and
478

Recurrent Representation
479

We illustrate the equivalence between the recurrent representation and the chunk-wise recurrent
480

representation. Specifically, let B denote the chunk length. For the output On, n can be divided as
481

n = kB + r where B is the chunk size. Following Equation 6, we have:
482

On =

n

m=1

(10)

where Γi = γn−i, ζij = γB−m, and [i] indicates the i-th chunk, i.e., x[i] = [x(i−1)B+1, · · · , xiB].
483

Then we write Rn as a recurrent function and compute the retention output of the i-th chunk via:
484

Ri =K⊺
[i](V[i] ⊙ζ) + γBRi−1

ζij = γB−i,
ξij = γi

Retention(X[i]) = (Q[i]K⊺

Finally, we show that the chunkwise recurrent representation is equivalent to the other representations.

C
Results with Different Context Lengths
486

As shown in Table 6, we report the results of language modeling with different context lengths. In
487

order to make the numbers comparable, we use 2048 text chunks as evaluation data and only compute
488

the perplexity for the last 128 tokens. Experimental results show that RetNet performs comparably
489

with Transformer in different context lengths.

D
Hyperparameters Used in Section 3.1
491

We use LLaMA [48] architecture, including RMSNorm [59] and SwiGLU [40, 7] module, as
492

the Transformer backbone, which shows better performance and stability. The weights of word
493

embedding and softmax projection are shared. Consequently, other variants follow these settings.
494

For RetNet, the FFN intermediate dimension is 5

3d and the value dimensions in WG, WV , WO are
495

also 5

3d, where the overall parameters are still 12d2.
496

For H3, we set the head dimension to 8. For RWKV, we use the TimeMix module to substitute
497

self-attention layers while keeping FFN layers consistent with other models for fair comparisons.
498

For Mamba, we follow all the details in the paper [19], where double-SSM layers are implemented
499

instead of “SSM + SwiGLU”. In addition to RetNet and Mamba, the FFN intermediate dimension is
500

all 8

3d. All models have 400M parameters, 24 layers, and a hidden dimension of 1024. We train the
501

models with 40k steps and a batch size of 0.25M tokens.

Hyperparameters Used in Section 3.2
503

We re-allocate the parameters in MSR and FFN for fair comparisons. Let d denote dmodel for simplicity
504

here. In Transformers, there are about 4d2 parameters in self-attention where WQ, WK, WV , WO ∈
505

Rd×d, and 8d2 parameters in FFN where the intermediate dimension is 4d. In comparison, RetNet
506

has 8d2 parameters in retention, where WQ, WK ∈Rd×d, WG, WV ∈Rd×2d, WO ∈R2d×d. Notice
507

that the head dimension of V is twice Q, K, similar to GAU [26]. The widened dimension is
508

projected back to d by WO. In order to keep the parameter number the same as Transformer, the FFN
509

intermediate dimension in RetNet is 2d. Meanwhile, we set the head dimension to 256, i.e., 256 for
510

queries and keys, and 512 for values. For fair comparison, we keep γ identical among different model
511

sizes, where γ = 1 −elinspace(log 1/32,log 1/512,h) ∈Rh instead of the default value in Equation (8).

G
Inference Cost of Grouped-Query Retention
517

We compare with grouped-query attention [1] and evaluate the method in the context of RetNet.
518

Grouped-query attention makes a trade-off between performance and efficiency, which has been
519

successfully verified in LLaMA2 34B/70B [49]. The method reduces the overhead of key/value cache
520

during inference. Moreover, the performance of grouped-query attention is better than multi-query
521

attention [42], overcoming the quality degradation brought by using one-head key value.
522

As shown in Table 10, we compare the inference cost with grouped-query attention and apply the
523

method for RetNet. For the LLaMA2 70B model, the number of key/value heads is reduced by 8×,
524

where the query head number is 64 while the key/value head number is 8. For RetNet-70B, the
525

parameter allocation is identical to LLaMA [48], where the dimension is 8192, and the head number
526

is 32 for RetNet. For RetNet-70B-GQ2, the key-value head number is 16, where grouped-query
527

retention is applied. We run the inference with four A100 GPUs without quantization.
528

When the batch size is 256, LLaMA2 runs out of memory while RetNet without group query still
529

has a high throughput. When equipped with grouped-query retention, RetNet-70B achieves 38%
530

acceleration and saves 30% memory.
531

We evaluate LLaMA2 under 2k and 8k lengths separately. The batch size is reduced to 8 so that
532

LLaMA2 can run without out of memory. Table 10 shows that the inference cost of Transformers
533

increases with the sequence length. In contrast, RetNet is length-invariant. Moreover, RetNet-70B-
534

GQ2 achieves better latency, throughput, and GPU memory than LLaMA2-70B-2k/8k equipped
535

with grouped-query attention. Notice that the evaluation metrics are averaged over positions of
536

different sequence lengths for a fair comparison, rather than only considering the inference cost of
537

the maximum length.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
540

1. Claims
541

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
542

paper’s contributions and scope?
543

Answer: [Yes]
544

Justification: The abstract and introduction is carefully written.
545

Guidelines:
546

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
547

made in the paper.
548

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
549

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
550

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
551

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
552

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
553

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
554

are not attained by the paper.
555

2. Limitations
556

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
557

Answer: [Yes]
558

Justification: Limitations are discussed in the paper.
559

Guidelines:
560

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
561

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
562

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
563

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
564

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
565

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
566

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
567

implications would be.
568

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
569

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
570

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
571

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
572

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
573

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
574

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
575

technical jargon.
576

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
577

and how they scale with dataset size.
578

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
579

address problems of privacy and fairness.
580

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
581

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
582

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
583

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
584

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
585

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
586

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
587

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
588

a complete (and correct) proof?
589

Answer: [NA]
590

18


---Page Break---
Justification: There is no theoretical result in this paper.
591

Guidelines:
592

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
593

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
594

referenced.
595

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
596

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
597

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
598

proof sketch to provide intuition.
599

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
600

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
601

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
602

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
603

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
604

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
605

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
606

Answer: [Yes]
607

Justification: The experiment can be easily reproduced based on the model description,
608

hyperparameter, and any well-known pre-training corpus.
609

Guidelines:
610

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
611

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
612

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
613

whether the code and data are provided or not.
614

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
615

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
616

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
617

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
618

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
619

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
620

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
621

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
622

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
623

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
624

appropriate to the research performed.
625

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
626

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
627

nature of the contribution. For example
628

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
629

to reproduce that algorithm.
630

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
631

the architecture clearly and fully.
632

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
633

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
634

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
635

the dataset).
636

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
637

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
638

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
639

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
640

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
641

5. Open access to data and code
642

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
643

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
644

material?
645

19


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
646

Justification: Code will be released in camera-ready version. All of the data we use is
647

public-available.
648

Guidelines:
649

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
650

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
651

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
652

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
653

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
654

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
655

benchmark).
656

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
657

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
658

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
659

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
660

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
661

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
662

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
663

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
664

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
665

versions (if applicable).
666

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
667

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
668

6. Experimental Setting/Details
669

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
670

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
671

results?
672

Answer: [Yes]
673

Justification: Hyperparameters are attached in the appendix.
674

Guidelines:
675

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
676

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
677

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
678

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
679

material.
680

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
681

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
682

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
683

Answer: [No]
684

Justification: For large language models, the variance between different runs is negligible.
685

Moreover, the evaluation pipeline is deterministic.
686

Guidelines:
687

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
688

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
689

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
690

the main claims of the paper.
691

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
692

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
693

run with given experimental conditions).
694

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
695

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
696

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
697

20


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
698

of the mean.
699

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
700

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
701

of Normality of errors is not verified.
702

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
703

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
704

error rates).
705

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
706

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
707

8. Experiments Compute Resources
708

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
709

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
710

the experiments?
711

Answer: [Yes]
712

Justification: The corresponding resources are stated in the paper.
713

Guidelines:
714

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
715

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
716

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
717

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
718

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
719

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
720

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
721

didn’t make it into the paper).
722

9. Code Of Ethics
723

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
724

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
725

Answer: [Yes]
726

Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in the research.
727

Guidelines:
728

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
729

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
730

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
731

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
732

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
733

10. Broader Impacts
734

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
735

societal impacts of the work performed?
736

Answer: [NA]
737

Justification: We work on fundamental research that has no direct societal impact.
738

Guidelines:
739

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
740

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
741

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
742

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
743

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
744

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
745

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
746

21


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
747

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
748

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
749

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
750

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
751

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
752

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
753

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
754

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
755

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
756

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
757

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
758

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
759

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
760

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
761

11. Safeguards
762

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
763

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
764

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
765

Answer: [NA]
766

Justification: The paper does not pose safety risks.
767

Guidelines:
768

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
769

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
770

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
771

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
772

safety filters.
773

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
774

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
775

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
776

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
777

faith effort.
778

12. Licenses for existing assets
779

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
780

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
781

properly respected?
782

Answer: [Yes]
783

Justification: We carefully follow the licenses of open-source code, data, and models.
784

Guidelines:
785

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
786

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
787

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
788

URL.
789

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
790

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
791

service of that source should be provided.
792

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
793

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
794

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
795

license of a dataset.
796

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
797

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
798

22


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
799

the asset’s creators.
800

13. New Assets
801

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
802

provided alongside the assets?
803

Answer: [NA]
804

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
805

Guidelines:
806

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
807

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
808

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
809

limitations, etc.
810

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
811

asset is used.
812

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
813

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
814

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
815

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
816

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
817

well as details about compensation (if any)?
818

Answer: [NA]
819

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
820

Guidelines:
821

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
822

human subjects.
823

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
824

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
825

included in the main paper.
826

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
827

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
828

collector.
829

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
830

Subjects
831

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
832

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
833

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
834

institution) were obtained?
835

Answer: [NA]
836

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
837

Guidelines:
838

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
839

human subjects.
840

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
841

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
842

should clearly state this in the paper.
843

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
844

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
845

guidelines for their institution.
846

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
847

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
