Abstract

When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized. While
large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequen-
tial perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate
and complex inputs effectively. To enhance LLM’s cognition capability, this paper
presents a novel concept of context structurization. Specifically, we transform
the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically
structurized elements. By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended
contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized
structures. Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures
and sizes (including a series of auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking
models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering,
exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval). Empirical
results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-
round structurization. In particular, we boost the open-sourced LLaMA2-70B
model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the halluci-
nation evaluator. Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs’
language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute
structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach. Code is available at

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable language capabilities [6, 53, 1], yet
remain at a discernible distance from human-level intelligence, especially when handling long-form,
sophisticated contexts as inputs [3, 36]. Scaling up the model size has significant benefits for boosting
context-comprehension and instruction-following abilities for LLMs [47, 58]. However, it is generally
resource-intensive on both model training and inference. This paper presents another perspective on
enhancing LLMs’ cognition capability without altering the models: context structurization.

The idea of structurization is motivated by neurocognitive science [51, 5, 17]. In human cognition, as
indicated in Fig. 1, sophisticated text sequences will be processed and consolidated into a structured
knowledge tree, with factual elements well-organized hierarchically [28, 15]. This process is defined
as structurization. People can precisely search information from general concepts to specific details
and make connections and comparisons along structures. We thus aim to transform plain texts into
structurized inputs, helping LLMs recognize and understand contexts in a human manner [71].

As Fig. 1 illustrates, input sequences are reorganized in a simple but generic three-layer structure:
scope, aspects, and descriptions. The scope summarizes the topic and contents, unfolding into
several main aspects with corresponding detailed descriptions. The structurized results can be freely

assembled into various natural language forms, depending on the specific downstream tasks. Fig. 2
provides an exemplar of our overall framework: after structurizing and reassembling the vanilla
context to highlight its scope and aspects of data imbalance handling techniques, LLMs become able
to grasp the target information about the dynamic weighting strategy and generate reliable responses.

The idea of language identiﬁcation is to 
classify a given audio signal into a particular 
class using a classiﬁcation algorithm. 
Commonly language identiﬁcation task was 
done using i-vector systems. A well known 
approach for language identiﬁcation proposed 
by N. Dahek et al. uses the GMM-UBM model 
to obtain utterance level features called i-
vectors. Recent advances in deep learning have 
helped to improve the language identiﬁcation 
task using many different neural network 
architectures which can be trained efﬁciently 
using GPUs for large scale datasets …

Cognition

Figure 1: Structured cognition on sequential
contexts. Humans may easily identify a given pas-
sage’s topic/scope, break down the text sentences
into several aspect points with detailed descrip-
tions, and form a tree-like knowledge structure.

We first execute the structurization by prompt-
ing advanced commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5-
Turbo1 or Qwen-Max2) with a few examples,
and then collect the results to train a smaller
7B-parameter LLaMA2 [53] or Qwen [2] model
as our StruXGPT. This is motivated by [48],
where the fundamental syntactic processing abil-
ity from giant LLMs is distilled into a responsive
and affordable StruXGPT-7B. Comprehensive
evaluations indicate that StruXGPT-7B inher-
its 97% of the structurization ability from the
teacher model, showing our method’s feasibility.

Empirical experiments are conducted on a di-
verse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based
question-answering, exhaustive hallucination
evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).
The results show that with a single-turn struc-
turization by our StruXGPT, the cognition per-
formance of vanilla large language models wit-
nesses consistent improvements regardless of
the model architecture and size variation. In
particular, we boost the open-sourced LLaMA2-
70B [53] to achieve comparable performance
against GPT-3.5-Turbo as a hallucination evaluator, and demonstrate the compatibility with other
advanced prompting techniques, such as CoT [59]. We hope this paper can bring new insights to the
community on building a more powerful and critical language model with human cognition.

Our contribution can be summarized as follows:

• We propose the concept of structurization, in order to enhance LLM’s cognition capability
without altering the models themselves.
• We present the feasibility of distilling the structurization ability from giant commercial LLMs
into a responsive and affordable StruXGPT-7B model, making our approach practical.
• With structurization, we empirically demonstrate the consistent cognition enhancement for
various LLMs across model architecture and size variation on diverse NLP tasks.

Related Work

Large language models (LLMs). LLMs’ emergent abilities [58] has recently received extensive
attention in the literature [6, 61, 9, 53, 23, 1], which are found closely related to the scaling law [26].
When the scale reaches a certain level, the performance on complex NLP tasks significantly rises due
to the superior in-context learning, instruction following, and reasoning abilities [71, 47]. Numerous
efforts have been made to boost the model capacity with training and prompting strategies [37, 38,
59, 14], and this paper presents a new perspective, context structurization, to encourage LLMs to
perceive, recognize, and communicate like humans [55, 71], without altering the model themselves.

Context augmentation. Recent studies have proposed several context augmentation methods to
enhance LLM’s cognition ability [59, 41] on when taking the long-form context (with thousands
of tokens) as inputs [3, 36, 30]. Specifically, aspect-based summarization (ABS) and query-based
summarization (QBS) [64, 69] are designed to extract important information from lengthy text data as
well, but they require pre-defined or user-input aspect/query lists to conduct targeted summarization,
and the detailed information will be inevitably lost during the summarization process. In contrast, the

Response

Figure 2: Framework overview. When instructed to generate responses based on vanilla long-form
and sophisticated contexts, LLMs often lose their focus and give unreliable answers due to their
limited cognition capability. In contrast, we structurize the vanilla context by using our StruXGPT to
identify its main scope and aspect points, facilitating the original LLMs to comprehend the context
and generate accurate responses.

paper develops context-wise structurization to highlight the knowledge structure, running a single-turn
structurization on the context to enhance LLMs’ cognition abilities on a diverse set of NLP tasks.

Structurization. In the conventional NLP literature, the term structured data usually refers to
entity-relation-entity triplets or properties extracted from plain texts, which are utilized to construct
knowledge graphs or databases with special data formats or schemas [24, 32]. On the contrary, the
structurization in this paper does not focus on entity-level information extraction and aggregation.
Instead, it suggests reorganizing the input sentences into a three-layer structure based on their inner
linguistic relations. Similar to discourse analysis and constituency parsing [10, 27], the main purpose
of our structurization is capturing the dependencies and relations of the elements within specific
long-form text inputs, so as to enhance LLMs’ cognition of the knowledge structure and relations.

Knowledge Distillation. In the era of large language model learning, distilling specific knowledge
from giant LLMs’ outputs has commonly been used to derive a more affordable but still powerful
language model [63, 19]. Previous attempts, such as Standford Alpaca [50] and Vicuna [8], show
the feasibility of collecting instruction-response pairs from GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 to train a smaller
fundamental [46] or domain-specific (e.g., with reasoning [43] or coding [20] skills) language models.
Our work also distills the structurization capability from the giant Qwen-Max model to a smaller yet
effective StruXGPT-7B model, with extensive evaluations to show the efficiency and efficacy.

Structurization

The substantial purpose of structurization is to mimic the human cognition process and transform
plain, sequential text sentences into a well-organized, hierarchical knowledge structure. Inspired by
the linguistic discourse analysis [11, 18], this paper develops a three-layer hierarchy exemplar to
present the cognition/knowledge structure, as introduced in Fig. 1:

(1) Scope summarizes the topic and boundary of the textual context. It outlines the central issues of
knowledge throughout the text and the scope of the discussion that will be covered.
(2) Aspect further subdivides the input context into several parts. It presents the aspects or dimen-
sions that must be considered to fully understand the topic and scope.
(3) Description is the most specific and detailed layer. It provides in-depth descriptions and analyses
to support each aspect of the context scope.

This generic three-layer structure is derived for efficacy and efficiency in dealing with diverse textual
inputs. There might be some elaborated structures (such as a knowledge mindmap [60]) to better
deconstruct specific text sources, but the difficulty and complexity of defining, extracting, and utilizing
those structures to aid in practical problems are dramatically increased. We leave this exploration in
our future work.

Next, we will present how to implement effective structurization with minimal cost in Sec. 3.1, and
demonstrate the utilization of the structurization results to enhance LLMs’ cognition abilities in
different downstream tasks in Sec. 3.2.

3.1
Efficient Implementation of Structurization

We have explored two approaches to execute the structurization process by leveraging the extraor-
dinary capability of large language models: few-shot prompting on commercial LLMs and direct
instructing our developed StruXGPT models.

Few-shot commercial LLM. In the initial stage, we use two in-context examples to query the
commercial Qwen-Max model to structurize the input corpus, since it shows promising instruction-
following and textual analyzing capability with over 200B parameters 3. Here is a simplified example
of prompting structurization in Fig. 3, and the full template is displayed in Appendix E.1.

Given a sequential statement, you are supposed to identify:

## Statement's scope:
```[generally a noun phrase]```

## Statement's main aspects and corresponding descriptions:
```
1. [the first aspect of the statement]

1.1 [a descriptive sentence]
1.3 [another descriptive sentence]
2. [the second aspect of the statement]

2.1 [a descriptive sentence]
3. [another aspect of the statement]
```

### Input:
{input_statement}

### Output:

Figure 3: Prompt template for structurization.

However, commercial LLMs are usually slow
and expensive, and sending user data to LLM
APIs may cause privacy and security problems
due to information leakage. Thus, we train a
smaller 7b-parameter model (e.g., LLaMA2 [53]
or Qwen [2]) to inherit the structurization ability
from giant commercial LLMs, which can be
deployed locally for efficiency and privacy.

Fine-tuned StruXGPT. Our tailored model is
named by StruXGPT, where Stru is the abbre-
viation of structurization, and X implies we do
not specify the model architecture. We carefully
curate 22,547 raw data pieces from Wikipedia4
and CAMEL-AI dataset [31] to ensure diversity,
and collect the structurized results from Qwen-
Max to train our StruXGPT via supervised fine-
tuning (SFT). From the collected samples, 200
are utilized for evaluation (including human verification), and the remaining training samples are
adopted to distill the structurization capability from Qwen-Max to our StruXGPT-7B. It is practical
since the structurization only relies on fundamental syntactic understanding and processing ability,
which has already been learned from the large-scale corpus. We merely teach the 7B-parameter
models how to reorganize the input text via SFT, without introducing new memorizing or creative
overloads. In addition, the ultimate StruXGPT does not require few-shot examples, and it reduces the
input lengths for further efficiency. The training details are described in Appendix A.1.

3.2
Effective Utilization of Structurization

The identified knowledge structure (i.e., the scope, aspect, and description hierarchy) from the raw
context is initially parsed in JSON format and unsuitable for direct inputs to handle massive lengthy
elements. Therefore, we use a unified template to transform the structured data back into natural
language sentences as models’ inputs to fit their intrinsic processing patterns, as LLMs are pre-trained
and aligned with mostly natural language data. Concurrently, to preserve and highlight the knowledge
structure, we harness specific linguistic markers to signal hierarchy and relationships among concept
elements, such as numbered lists for order, bullet points for categorization, and indentation to depict
nesting levels of information. Fig. 4 showcases some typical examples.

The first row of Fig. 4 provides a unified template to transform structurization results into natural
languages. The top-level hierarchy scope is presented as a standalone sentence, serving as the
introduction to the structured context and highlighted with bold markers. Subsequently, the secondary
aspect are organized with numerical markers and bolded, attaching with its corresponding tertiary
descriptions through subclauses or separate sentences. This method not only signifies the rank and
relation of each piece of information relative to others but also provides clear, navigable paths for
the LLMs to follow and process the information efficiently (e.g., when examining the long-form
comprehension capability). Moreover, the second row of Fig. 4 introduces another variation for
transformation, where each description elements are further broken down and enumerated for the
delineation of fine-grained details, making it easier for language models to discern and retain specific
nuances associated with each aspect (e.g., when examining the hallucination detection capability).

After transformation, the linguistic input retains its structured knowledge through systematic cues

understanding and interaction with complex data but also enables the models to leverage their existing
natural language capabilities to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Experiments

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on a series of downstream NLP tasks to compre-
hensively demonstrate the efficacy of structurization. We hope the results can bring new insights to
enhancing LLM’s cognition via structurization, regardless of model architecture and size variation.

Three representative natural language understanding and processing tasks are investigated, includ-
ing context-based question-answering Sec. 4.1, exhaustive hallucination evaluation Sec. 4.2, and
passage-level dense retrieval Sec. 4.3. When instructing tested LLMs to perform target tasks, we
merely structurize the vanilla textual inputs, transform the results back into natural languages, and
immediately feed the results to LLMs to make responses. The tested LLMs themselves are not
fine-tuned on structurized data corpus. We adopt our StruXGPT-7B model to execute structurization
in all experiments in this section. The evaluation and ablation of StruXGPT model are demonstrated
in Sec. 4.4, Sec. 4.5, and Sec. 4.6, and more comparison with related augmentation-based methods
can be found in Appendix B.3 and Appendix B.5.

4.1
Application on Context-based Question-Answering

Question-answering based on a long-form context is an emerging research area within QA, which
requires large language models to precisely seek the target information and generate reliable responses
to the question [3, 30]. It is an immediate measure of LLM’s cognition ability to handle intricate and
sophisticated contexts. In this section, we comprehensively evaluate how structurization boosts QA
ability on seven datasets from the LongBench benchmark [3] with a variety of LLMs to examine.

Dataset setup. LongBench [3] is a multi-task benchmark tailored for long context understanding
evaluation, composed of 6 major task categories and 21 different tasks. To focus on the investigation
of context structurization, we choose 7 subsets from LongBench across single-document QA, multi-
document QA, and synthetic QA tasks in English, and the remaining Chinese subsets or code-
orientated tasks are eliminated. Except for the MultiFieldQA subset with 150 testing samples, each
subset contains 200 pieces of context-question-answer triplets to evaluate, resulting in 1,350 samples
to test in total. Each subset has a 4K-18K context length on average. If the context length exceeds an
LLM’s window size, we truncate from the middle of the text and preserve information at the beginning
and end, as suggested by LongBench. Detailed dataset description is displayed in Appendix B.2.

Evaluated models. Following [3], we evaluate three representative large language models on
long context comprehension ability: LLaMA2-7B-4k [53], Qwen-7B-8k [2], and ChatGLM3-6B-
32k [67], and extend the larger LLaMA2-13B-4k [53] model. The four LLMs have a relatively similar
parameter capacity with different model architectures and window sizes. All the models to examine
are pre-trained chat models, and we just employ our StruXGPT to structurize the input contexts to
enhance those LLMs’ cognition capabilities. To ensure reproducibility and reduce uncertainty, greedy
search is adopted during LLM’s decoding process when generating responses. The accuracy between
models’ responses and ground-truth answers is measured by ROUGE-L and F1-score.

Experimental results. Tab. 1 suggests structurized contexts bring consistent improvements on almost
all 3 tasks and 7 subsets across the model architectures and window sizes. Specifically, structurization
leads to relatively greater improvement for the MultiDoc-QA subtask (with a 3% performance gain
on average), revealing the potential promotion of LLMs’ multi-hop reasoning abilities. Despite
the negligible decline on the Musique [54] subset (see Appendix B.2 for analysis), the advanced
ChatGLM3-6B-32k is also boosted, showing structurization’s efficacy for powerful models.

Comparison with other baselines. To further evaluate our structurization augmentation, we compare
our method against the typical summarization-based methods that also employ LLMs for context
augmentation. The results are presented in Appendix B.3, which further demonstrates our superiority
in highlighting the knowledge structure without loss of key information.

position of the model’s first token prediction, we
average the attention maps across the 32 atten-

structurized context clearly presents the content

and LLaMA2-7B immediately grasps the target

structurization.

Dataset setup. AttrScore [66] and
FactScore [42] datasets are adopted
for evaluation. We take the AttrEval-
GenSearch test set with 245 exam-
ples from AttrScore, where each ex-
ample comprises a statement and its
reference passage, and is annotated
by Attributable (abbreviated as Attr.),
Contradictory (abbreviated as Con-
tra.), and Extrapolatory (abbreviated
as Extra.). FactScore collected 4,726
atomic claims/statements of people bi-
ographies generated by InstructGPT
(abbreviated as InstGPT), 5,426 by
ChatGPT, and 5,888 by PerplexityAI
(abbreviated as PPLAI). For each in-
put sample, we leverage StruXGPT to
structurize the reference to identify its
main aspects and detailed descriptions.
The numerically ordered structure is
preserved, as displayed in Fig. A3,
since we explicitly ask the evaluator to check the information along the structure for judgment.

Evaluated models. We mainly investigate the open-sourced LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-70B models
as the LLM-evaluator, and also explore the integration with the close-source GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106 [6]
via API access. The main results are presented in Tab. 2. We also report the results with Qwen models
on AttrScore and FactScore and the incorporation to more powerful GPT-4 in Appendix B.4.

Experimental results. According to Tab. 2, our structurization brings significant enhancements to
both LLaMA2-7B and 70B models (for 6.4% and 4.3% on average, respectively). And the powerful
GPT-3.5 model also gains 4.1% (from 58.0% to 62.1%). Furthermore, we incorporate the Chain-of-
Thought (CoT) technique into the prompt template to clarify the evaluation steps (such as Carefully
read the claim and double-check the answer.) (denoted as “GPT-3.5-1106 + CoT”). After that, the
GPT-3.5 model immediately obtains an improvement of 4.0% (from 58.0% to 62.0%). Consequently,
on top of the advanced CoT prompt, our method further enhances the model to a higher accuracy of
65.4% on average, demonstrating our method’s compatibility with advanced prompting techniques.

4.3
Application on Passage-level Dense Retrieval

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been empirically validated to significantly bolster LLM’s
domain knowledge [29, 62], where precise document retrieval plays a vital role. We now investigate
how structurization can facilitate dense retrieval for BERT-like masking language models.

Dataset setup. BEIR dataset [52] is a popular benchmark for evaluating dense retrievers’ zero-
shot effectiveness [39, 33], where retrievers are trained on MS MARCO’s passage-retrieval training
split [44] while directly tested on the BEIR benchmark without finetuning. We focus on our evaluation
of the 5 subsets from BEIR i.e., NFCorpus, FiQA, ArguAna, SciDocs, and SciFact.

Evaluated models. BERT [13], SimLM [57], and coCondenser [16] are chosen for evaluation,
since they achieve state-of-the-art performance on MS MARCO’s development split. To convert
the structurized passages from our StruXGPT into natural languages, we eliminate the numerical
indicators (such as “1.”, “1.1”, etc.) and attach the description statements in the third layer with their
aspects. Fig. A3 presents an example. We only structurize passages to enhance retrievers’ cognition,
and the queries remain unchanged. Following the literature, nDCG@10 results are reported in Tab. 3.

Experimental results. Structurization boosts all three retrievers on most subsets, yielding a maximum
performance improvement of 4.5% on SciFact for SimLM. The results suggest that structurization
not only augments decoder-only generative LLMs with explosive parameters (at least 7B), but also
benefits encoder-decoder masked language models with constrained parameters (around 110M). It
implies that the patterning of linguistic and semantic structurization may be a fundamental mechanism
for enhancing language models, transcending distinctions in their architectural design and scale.

4.4
Evaluation of the Structurization Approach Itself

In this section, we assess various structurization methods through exhaustive experiments on five
approaches, including prompting Qwen-max with few-shot exemplars (serves as our teacher model),
few-shot Qwen-7B and LLaMA2-7B pre-trained chat models, and our fine-tuned Qwen-7B and
LLaMA2-7B (student) models. As introduced in Sec. 3.1, we use 200 validation cases and have the
five models generate 1,000 structurized outputs for analysis.

A good structurization should effectively deconstruct the vanilla input text to clearly identify its
knowledge structure, so as to facilitate LLM’s cognition. The resulting content should be faithful to
the original texts, neither dismiss the factual information nor fabricate statements or opinions that
do not exist. To this end, we revise four evaluation metrics to investigate the efficacy of different
structurization approaches, and the results are displayed in Tab. 4.

Lexical evaluation (LexicalEval). We first leverage the widely-used ROUGE-L [34, 35, 25] to
assess recall and precision between structured content and original text. However, lexical metrics
from the methods, ranging 0.6 to 0.7, inadequately reflect structurization quality where LLMs will
paraphrase the words but lexical scores miss the semantic consistency. For instance, a statement
pair “They adopt ROUGE” and “ROUGE is adopted” only receives a 0.33 f1-score for ROUGE-L.
Therefore, a crucial human evaluation is developed to obtain a trustworthy conclusion.

Human evaluation (HumanEval). We recruited 17 well-trained natural language annotators from
the PAI-iTAG platform5 to evaluate the structurization quality on a 0-5 scale across three dimensions:
completeness (ensuring no loss of information from the original text), factuality (accurate three-layer
deconstruction), and anti-hallucination (avoiding fabricated content). As annotating structurization

---Page Break---
only involves linguistic and syntactic level judgments, annotators do not need professional expertise
to check the information of a given text itself. The detailed evaluation criteria are displayed in
Appendix A.3, and we report the labeling results in Tab. 4.

The commercial Qwen-max shows a promising instruction-following and in-context learning ability,
generally scoring 4.5 at the three dimensions. However, the pre-trained 7B models from Qwen and
LLaMA2 immediately decline the scores to below 4.0, as they struggle to understand the instruction
to build the three-layer structure and tend to hallucinate responses due to the limited model capacity.
More structurization examples can be found in Appendix E.2. Notably, the fine-tuned StruXGPT-
7B-Q(wen) and StruXGPT-7B-L(LaMA2) both obtain a 4.35 - 4.45 score on average. They inherit
97% of structurization capability from the Qwen-max teacher model, evidencing the effectiveness of
training a specialized 7B-parameter model for structurization to aid in efficiency and privacy.

Evaluation with downstream application (AppEval). Since our main motivation is to utilize
structurization to enhance LLM’s cognition, a further evaluation is conducted to investigate those
different structurization methods. Specifically, we compare how much improvement (∆) those
methods can bring to downstream natural language processing applications. On the Qasper subset [12]
from LongBench [3], we instruct an independent LLaMA2-7B chat model for reading comprehension
with long-context structurized by different approaches. LLaMA2-7B receives a 19.6 F1-score for QA
accuracy when taking the vanilla context as input, which serves as the baseline performance.

The evaluation results are displayed in Tab. 4, which are consistent with the human evaluation
presented above. In particular, the few-shot Qwen-max achieves an over 3% improvement in answer
quality, while the pre-trained 7B-parameter chat models fail to generate validated structurizations.
Meanwhile, our fine-tuned StruXGPT-7B-LLaMA and StruXGPT-7B-Qwen models bring com-
parable enhancements against the few-shot Qwen-max, emphasizing the efficacy of distilling the
structurization ability from giant teacher models to a more responsive and affordable student model.

Evaluation with semantic embedding (SemEval). At last, we explore the structurization quality
evaluation in the semantic embedding perspective, as a supplementary to lexical evaluation. Follow-
ing Zhang et al. [68], we calculate the semantic similarity between original and structurized contents
with the embedding similarities, and the results in Tab. 4 show consistent measure against HumanEval
and AppEval with a much lower cost. Hence, BERTScore [68] can be further leveraged as an effective
and efficient quality-assessment tool for training-data filtering and structurization quality evaluation
to derive a better StruXGPT model. Sec. 4.6 presents some preliminary investigations.

Through the comprehensive evaluation of three protocols, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy
of training a specialized StruXGPT. It is more resource-friendly to deploy for efficiency and privacy,
meanwhile inheriting 97% of the ability from giant teacher models to perform structurization.

4.5
Ablation Studies on StruXGPT’s Establishment

This section studies two major factors of training a StruXGPT model: data quality and model capacity.

Using two few-shot examples is sufficient to collect high-quality training data. In this work,
we choose 2 in-context examples to prompt commercial LLMs (as a teacher) to generate data pairs
of raw/structurized texts to train our StruXGPT-7B model (as a student). We think it is enough for
teacher models to understand the structurization process and generate valid training samples, as the
2 examples respectively describe the 2 most common types of real-world text (i.e., with/without
existing indicators like “1.”, “2.”, etc), which is displayed in Appendix E.2.

To further verify it, we investigate the number of in-context examples with two evaluation protocols (as
in Tab. 4): AppEval (an improvement on Qasper subset with context structurization) and BERTScore
(semantic similarity with raw and structurized texts in the validation set). We also report the error rate
when parsing structurization results from the teacher model’s outputs (denoted as “FormatError”).

According to Tab. 5, 1-shot is apparently insufficient to illustrate structurization, while 2- and 3-shot
achieve comparable structurization quality under AppEval and BERTScore. Notably, 3-shot receives
a 2% lower FormatError than 2-shot, in trade for the increased inference cost (because of increased
few-shot samples). We argue that the 2% gap (around 400 samples) does not make a difference for
the final StruXGPT training, which can be verified in Appendix A.2. Therefore, we recommend users
to apply 3- or even more shots when prompting teacher LLMs if available, otherwise 2-shot is also a
good choice to balance the inference cost and structurization quality.

StruXGPT-7B balances parameter capacity and structurization quality. As Qwen [2] provides
a series of models varying sizes, in Tab. 6, we implemented StruXGPT on Qwen-1.8B/7B/14B
respectively to investigate the relationship between model capacity and structurization quality.

Compared with the 7B model capacity, the smaller 1.8B model, despite its positive enhancement on
downstream applications, shows slight inferiority in both AppEval (+2.7 v.s. +3.6) and BERTScore
(0.299 v.s. 0.313), and presents 5% error rate when parsing structurization results. On the other hand,
the 14B model brings further improvement to BERTScore, (the structurization content is relatively
more faithful to original texts), but the boost on AppEval is insignificant. Hence, the 7B model is a
good trade-off between model capacity (training/inference efficiency) and structurization quality.

4.6
Utilization of Structurization Quality Assessment

As the structurization quality simultaneously influences StruXGPT’s training performance and
application improvements, this section investigates the quality assessment tool BERTScore (as
discussed in Sec. 4.2) on StruXGPT’s training and inference stages, respectively.

On one hand, as the training data quality determines StruXGPT’s upper bound, we statistic the
BERTScore of the 22K training entries, and around 94.45% raw/structurized text pairs present
positive scores (normalized by the baseline score of 0.83, and a positive BERTScore presents a benign
similarity), demonstrating the high quality of our training data. Consequently, we eliminated around
5% of data with negative scores and trained another StruXGPT model, and the results in Tab. 7
indicate this part of data does not affect the final performance. According to Appendix A.2, data
quantity may play a vital role in further improving our StruXGPT.

On the other hand, since poor structurization results can lead to suboptimal application performance,
we statistic the enhancement variance in the Qasper subset from LongBench [3] in Tab. 8 for
structurized context inputs. Our method merely causes degradation on 3.5% of samples (with
relatively lower structurization quality), but ultimately receives a +3.6 improvement overall test
samples. Furthermore, we filter out the structurization results with a low BERTScore (e.g., <0.05)
and take back the original context as input. In this way, the degradation can be alleviated (from 3.5%
to 3.0%), further improving the final enhancement to +3.7. The lower bound of our StruXGPT can
thus be ensured.

Conclusion and Discussion

This paper presents a novel concept of context structurization to enhance LLM’s cognition capability.
Extensive evaluations of various representative NLP tasks reveal the consistent enhancement across
language model’s architectural designs and capacity scales. We demonstrate the feasibility of distilling
the structurization ability from giant commercial LLMs into a responsive and private StruXGPT-
7B model, addressing the practicality problem. The limitation and future work are discussed in
Appendix C. We hope this paper can bring new insights into how to build a more powerful and
reliable language model with human cognition and intelligence.

Implementation Details of Structurization

A.1
Implementation Details

The data to train our StruXGPT is carefully curated from two main aspects. First, to ensure diversity,
we randomly sample 15,000 passages from Wikipedia across various domains, whose token length
ranges from 1K to 3K. Then, we also supply round 15,000 statement passages from the domain-
specific model- and human-generated content, including the filtered CAMEL-AI [31], FiQA [40],
and MedQuad [4] datasets. With Qwen-max API, we collect the structurized results and eliminate
the failed cases (usually due to internet inaccessibility and unexpected output format), resulting in
22,547 pieces of training data in total to derive our StruXGPT, and 200 test samples for evaluation.

StruXGPT is built upon LLaMA2- or Qwen-7B-chat models, which had been aligned to humans
with promising instruction-following capabilities with their prior knowledge. The 22,547 pieces
of input-output pairs are utilized to distill the structurization ability to StruXGPT via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Specifically, StruXGPT is trained with a constant learning rate of 5 × 10−6 for
LLaMA and 1 × 10−5 for Qwen for 1 epoch. The batch size is 128, and other hyper-parameters
follow the default settings from Touvron et al. [53] and Bai et al. [2]. The training is resource-friendly,
which can be done on 8 NVIDIA V100 (16G) GPUs for 3.5 hours.

For all the inference experiments, we leverage 1-2 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs for model deployment.

A.2
Additional Ablation Studies on Training Data

To further investigate the training sample size and its impact, we have conducted additional ablation
studies on StruXGPT’s training process, and report the question-answering capability enhancement
for the same LLaMA2-7B-Chat model on LongBench’s Qasper subset, as introduced in Sec. 4.4.

Table A1: Ablation on training samples.

Training Samples
Enhancement

2K
-0.6
5K
-1.3
10K
+2.6
15K
+3.3
22K
+3.6

Our results in Tab. A1 reveal an interesting pattern: as
the training sample increases, StruXGPT first causes a
decline in the LLaMA2-7B model’s QA performance, and
then brings stable enhancement with larger training data
(over 10K samples). We attribute this to the fact that we
train StruXGPT for only one epoch in each experiment to
prevent overfitting. Consequently, models trained with too
few samples often exhibit subpar structurization quality,
commonly resulting in information loss or hallucination,
which adversely affects downstream performance.

Specifically, for the model trained with 2K samples, the
generated outputs frequently contain incorrect formatting and struggle to parse the three-tier structure
effectively. In these cases, we resort to using the original text as a fallback input for downstream
LLMs, which accounts for the somewhat lower performance drop (-0.6%) compared to the model
trained on 5K samples (-1.3%).

A.3
Human Evaluation

Criteria. A good structurization should effectively deconstruct the vanilla input text to clearly identify
its knowledge structure, and the structurized results should be faithful to the original texts, neither
dismissing the factual information nor fabricating statements or opinions that do not exist. Therefore,
we devise three dimensions to evaluate the structurization quality, and each of the dimensions can be
scored from 0 to 5 (higher is better). The detailed criteria are displayed in Fig. A1, and the annotating
screenshot is provided in Fig. A2.

Instruction. The full annotation instruction is displayed below:

Assess the quality of structured outputs produced by different sources, and evaluate whether the structured output
is sufficiently “good” by using a score ranging from 0 to 5. To clarify what constitutes a “good” structured result,
please consider and score the following aspects, with each aspect also scoring from 0 to 5.
Scoring Criteria: Please see Fig. A1.

Payment. The payment for annotators is 2,000¥ in total, which is higher than the minimum wage in
our country.

Details for Context-based Question-Answering on LongBench

Detailed dataset description. To focus on the investigation of context structurization, we choose 7
subsets from LongBench across single-document QA, multi-document QA, and synthetic QA tasks
in English, and the remaining Chinese subsets or code-orientated tasks are eliminated:

• Single-Doc QA. For single-document QA, we take two subsets from LongBench:
(1)
Qasper [12], featured by question-answering over NLP technical papers and annotated by
NLP practitioners; (2) MultiFieldQA, manually curated from multiple data sources and anno-
tated by Ph.D. students. MultiFieldQA contains 150 Context-Question-Answer triplets to test,
and Qasper and other adopted subsets include 200 pieces of test samples respectively.
• Multi-Doc QA. Multi-document QA requires LLMs to extract and combine information from
multiple documents to derive the answer, which is generally more challenging than single-doc
QA. We take three multi-hop QA datasets: (1) HotpotQA [65], containing 2-hop questions
written by native speakers given two related paragraphs; (2) 2WikiMultihopQA [22], involving
up to 5-hop questions synthesized through manually designed templates on Wikipedia passages;
and (3) MuSiQue [54], carefully composed with up to 4-hop reasoning on an increased number
of supporting and distracting context evidence.
• Synthetic QA. We employ two extra synthetic tasks to test LLM’s long-context handling ability
on specific scenarios and patterns: (1) PassageCount, requiring models to count the number of
unique passages from a shuffled passages pool; and (2) PassageRetrieval, randomly choosing
one of 30 passages to obtain its summarization with GPT-3.5-Turbo, and asking tested LLMs to
determine the original passage with which the summarization is crafted.

Performance analysis on MuSiQue. On the LongBench dataset [3], ChatGLM-3-32K [67] receives
a slight decline (around 0.1%) on the MuSiQue subset [54] when taking structurized contexts as
input. The main reason is that MuSiQue is too complicated. It requires up to 4-hop reasoning on
manually paraphrased questions on a large amount of supporting and distracting context evidence. For
ChatGLM-3-32K that has already achieved a considerable cognition ability, context structurization in
the inference stage is temporally unable to bring significant advances in such a complex scenario.
Next, we will delve into developing methodologies for training LLMs to capture the intrinsic structure
of context, unlocking structurization’s potential in enhancing LLMs on more complicated NLP tasks.

B.3
Comparison with Aspect- and Query-Based Summarization

Aspect-Based Summarization (ABS) and Query-Based Summarization (QBS) are classical context
augmentation methods in the NLP literature, which aims to gradually extract important information
from lengthy text data based on pre-defined aspect list or user-input queries. The summary that
contains key information will be integrated into context inputs to augment tested LLMs to generate
reliable responses, rather than lost in irrelevant sentences in the original lengthy inputs. We take ABS
and QBS as the comparative baseline to further evaluate the efficacy of our proposed structurization
augmentation strategy.

We investigate ABS and QBS on five document-QA subsets in LongBench [3]. Specifically, as the
pre-defined aspect list is unavailable for each passage in LongBench, we turn the traditional ABS to
input-agnostic paragraph-based summarization to lengthy paragraphs, where the prompt template
is: Summarize the following text with no more than three sentences. Passage: {text}; Summary: .
For QBS, the prompt template focuses on specific queries: Summarize the following text to answer
the query with no more than three sentences. Query: {query}; Passage: {text}; Summary:. The
{text} and {query} are placeholders, and the output summaries are respectively concatenated to form
the augmented passages as inputs. We report the performance variance of the same test model (i.e.,
LLaMA2-7B-Chat [53]) when taking vanilla, summarized, and our structurized passages as inputs to
answer the same given questions, as displayed below (due to the space limitation, we merely report
the averaged enhancement on the five subsets).

Based on Tab. A2, we observed that ABS, without guidance from pre-defined aspects lists or user-
input queries, failed to preserve critical information, and led to performance declines in four out of
the five subsets. Conversely, QBS, with user query guidance, achieved improvements in the Qasper,
HotpotQA, and Musique subsets. However, substantial information loss during the summarization
process resulted in decreased performance on the MultiFieldQA subset. In contrast, our structured
approach delivered consistent improvements across all subsets, demonstrating its efficacy.

In addition, ABS and QBS are applicable for passage-based question-answering tasks but do not
extend well to other tasks such as hallucination assessment, where every piece of information counts
and should not be summarized. Our approach is task-agnostic, highlighting the generalizability.

B.4
Additional Experiments for Hallucination Evaluation

Qwen models as the LLM evaluators. In Sec. 4.2 in the manuscript, we mainly study structurization
with LLaMA2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo on the AttrScore benchmark. For a thorough comparison, this
section provides the investigation of employing another series of models, i.e., Qwen-7B and Qwen-
72B [2], on AttrScore and FactScore datasets to further demonstrate our method’s efficacy. Results
are presented in Tab. A3 and Tab. A4, respectively.

For the 7B- and 72B-parameter Qwen evaluators, structurization can immediately improve judgment
accuracy on both AttrScore and FactScore datasets. The smaller Qwen-7B model receives a more
significant enhancement, along with a nearly 10% improvement in all metrics (except the Attr. criteria
in Tab. A3) on the two datasets. It indicates smaller LLMs may be more reliant on structurization to
enhance their cognitive and information-seeking capabilities than large-scale LLMs. Simultaneously,
the larger Qwen-72B evaluator also witnesses a considerable improvement with a 3%-4% increase.
In particular, based on the structurized references, Qwen-72B achieves a competitive evaluation
performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo on the FactScore benchmark, and even slightly outperforms
GPT-4 on the Contra. criteria in AttrScore. Those results substantiate the effectiveness of leveraging
structurization to further enhance powerful language models with considerable size capacities.

Consequently, Tab. A6 further presents the incorporation of our StruXGPT with the more powerful

Comparison with Other Augmentation Methods

Besides the summarization-based and prompting-based augmentation methods (in Appendix B.5 and
Appendix B.4 respectively), here we also compare our structurization approach with AdaptLLM [7],
which developed several domain-specific LLMs (in BioMedicine, Finance, and Low) via the proposed
reading-comprehension training technique. The experimental results are presented in Tab. A7.

Accordingly, our method can also boost the Llama-7b baseline for 3%-7% without training, while
AdaptLLM requires costly continual training of the baseline model on each domain corpus. In particu-
lar, for the general reading comprehension task, AdaptLLM-Fin does not introduce significant boosts,
while AdaptLLM-Bio/Law even cause performance drops, which is mainly because AdaptLLM’s
domain-adaptation tuning will harm the general capability more or less. In contrast, our method
does not alter the baseline model, but only structurizes the input context to enhance LLM’s cognition

ability on downstream tasks, showing stable and consistent improvements (e.g., a 2.5% increase on
BoolQ). Although our final performance is slightly inferior to the domain-specialized AdaptLLM,
our generalizability emphasizes the contribution of our work, as we bring consistent enhancement
across downstream domains and cause no degradation on general tasks.

C
Limitation and Future Work

Training-time aggregation. This paper mainly investigates structurization during LLM’s inference
stage. Despite the universal enhancement across language models and NLP tasks, structurization has
not yet fully tapped into its potential. Specifically, developing methodologies for training LLMs to
capture the intrinsic structure of context and extrinsic correlations among training corpus presents an
unresolved challenge in the field. We will delve into this problem in our future work.

Inference efficiency. We acknowledge that the introduced inference cost is a common limitation
for the methods adopting LLMs for data augmentation, which depends on computing resources and
the optimization techniques employed. Here we conduct extra experiments with the competitive
augmentation methods (i.e., ABS and QBS in Appendix B.3) for an in-depth comparison on the Long-
Bench [3] dataset for question-answering evaluation. Besides, we also investigate the AttrScore [66]
dataset for hallucination evaluation to assess the impact of input length and output length, as well as
the model size. The inference time, measured in seconds per sample, is calculated on an NVIDIA
A100 GPU with vllm 6 acceleration (except for the LLaMA2-70B model, which demands at least
two A100 GPUs for deployment).

LongBench contains input passages with an average length of 14K tokens (computed with the
LLaMA2 tokenizer), which burdens the cost for all the data augmentation methods. According to
Tab. A8, only the task-specific QBS can bring a positive enhancement of 0.2% on average, which is
negligible compared with the 2.5% boost by our task-agnostic structurization approach. However,
the LLM-based data augmentation methods generally introduce an extra 2.5-2.9 seconds cost. To
alleviate this problem, we have recently noticed a new decoding acceleration technique named
Selection-of-Thought (SoT) [45], which is also motivated by the aspect-based thinking and writing
process of humans and is naturally compatible with our structurization process. With the 2.39× speed
up and negligible quality decrease (denoted as “† Ours + SoT”), the extra cost of our method can be
further reduced to an acceptable 1.2 seconds, which we believe makes it more practical.

are shown in Tab. 2), in trade of the 1.5× increased time cost for the vanilla LLaMA2-7B evaluator.
As the base evaluator is scaled up to a larger LLaMA2-70B model, our method merely introduces
12% extra cost (2.1s) and still gains a considerable enhancement of 4.3%. Our method showcases
more advantages by incorporating larger base models.

Performance on General Evaluation Benchmarks As our method focuses on context structurization
to enhance LLM’s cognition ability, for the tasks where no context is provided, our method may not
bring significant enhancement and even get worse. The commonly used MMLU benchmark [21] is a
typical scenario, where LLMs are asked to answer questions without context references but requiring
their parametric knowledge (learned during large-scale pre-training), and context structurization does
not help. If we insist on structurizing the question alone and feeding it into LLM’s inputs, the model
may be disturbed by the introduced information from StruXGPT and generate wrong answers. As
shown in Tab. A10, our method causes a slight 0.1% decrease (measured by OpenCompass protocol7)
when taking LLaMA2-7B-Chat [53] as the baseline model.

On the other hand, we have also tested another common benchmark, BBH [49], which is designed to
evaluate LLMs’ reasoning capability when dealing with several logical sentences/statements. In this
case, our method can adapt well to highlight the logical relations and boost LLM’s reasoning abilities
by 0.8%.

In conclusion, we suggest users apply structurization to long-form or logically complex contexts,
while taking the original question as inputs when there is no context provided.

D
Broader Impacts

We discuss the positive and negative societal impacts as follows:

Positive Societal Impacts. Through the innovative approach of context structurization, this work
significantly enhances the comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading
to more effective and efficient applications in various sectors such as education, healthcare, and
customer service. Avoiding the need for larger models, it not only curtails the environmental impact
associated with training sophisticated AI systems but also democratizes access to cutting-edge AI
technologies. This fosters a broader base for innovation and empowers smaller entities with the tools
to contribute meaningfully to technological advancement. Moreover, our method, rooted in human
cognitive processes, promises to enrich human-AI collaboration, paving the way for solving complex
societal issues by leveraging AI’s improved problem-solving capabilities.

Negative Societal Impacts. On the flip side, the advances made through structurization bear potential
risks, including the augmentation of disinformation campaigns and the creation of more sophisticated
deepfakes, which could undermine trust in digital content. The enhanced capabilities of LLMs
might also be co-opted for intrusive surveillance, raising substantial privacy and ethical dilemmas.
Furthermore, the inherent biases in training data could be deepened, potentially automating and
perpetuating social inequalities. The concentration of advanced AI technologies in the hands of a
few could limit competition and place immense power over information dissemination with those
entities, while increasing reliance on AI for critical decision-making could inadvertently erode
human analytical skills over time. To mitigate these concerns, it is essential to establish rigorous
ethical standards and robust oversight mechanisms that govern the deployment of LLMs, ensuring
transparency and accountability in their use. Furthermore, active research and the implementation of
bias detection, correction frameworks, and the development of media literacy programs are crucial

steps to preemptively address the potential misuse, privacy violations, and societal impact of these
advanced AI systems.

Prompt Examples for Structurization

E.1
Prompt Templates

Fig. A4 displays the few-shot prompt template to query giant commercial LLMs to execute structur-
ization. We first introduce the instruction for structurization (including the task definition and output
formats), then provide two representative examples to further illustrate the process. The first example
in Fig. A5 tells the model to focus on the existing numerical or enumeration indicators to assist in
constructing the aspect-description structure. The second example in Fig. A6 teaches the model to
automatically summarize the aspects and attach their corresponding descriptions from the raw text
sequences. Finally, in Fig. A4 we ask commercial LLMs to structurize the input_statement from
user input as expected.

To ensure completed and faithful structurization on long-form input statements (usually with thou-
sands of tokens), we provide two detailed exemplars in Fig. A5 and Fig. A6 for commercial LLMs’
few-shot learning. However, these two exemplars take a considerable context length, which may
even confuse the distilled StruXGPT-7B with a smaller size capacity. We thus remove the examples
in StruXGPT-7B’s prompt template, as StruXGPT-7B has learned how to perform structurization
as desired and the functionality of those examples is negligible. Specifically, the example_1 and
example_2 (with their introductions) are removed for both efficiency and efficacy.

E.2
Structurization Examples

In this section, we present several structurization examples from different models as discussed in
Sec. 3 in the manuscript. Given an input statement about Facebook’s stock, Fig. A7 shows that
Qwen-max produces a factual and faithful structurization result with the help of few-shot exemplars.
It clearly identifies the main aspects of the original statement, and attaches the corresponding
descriptions into each aspect. On the contrary, Fig. A8 indicates the smaller pre-trained 7B-size
Qwen and LLaMA2 models failed to follow the instructions to produce qualified structurizations.
There exists a fabricated “Note” content in Qwen-7B’s response. Meanwhile, LLaMA2-7B is even
unable to follow the desired format, and information like “Facebook doesn’t sell anything tangible”
is missing. Fig. A9 demonstrate the effectiveness of our fine-tuned 7B-parameter StruXGPT model,
which is able to structurize the input statement as expected, with comparable performance to the giant
Qwen-max model with over 200B-size.

You are a helpful NLP assistant. 

Help me rephrase a given statement to identify:

(1) a summary of the statement's scope, which should generally be a noun phrase with a few words.

(2) a list of main aspects on which the statement is discussing. Each main aspect should be a noun or noun phrase. 
The aspect list should be precise and concise to conclude the statement, and the number of aspects should be limited.

(3) an enumeration of descriptive sentences regarding each aspect above, which display the details of those aspects. 
Each description sentence must be completed and faithful to the original statement. You should NOT remove any 
descriptive segment in this layer.

Given an original statement, the rephrased structure should strictly follow this format:

## Statement's scope:
```[generally a noun phrase]```

## Statement's main aspects and corresponding descriptions:
```
1. [the first aspect of the statement]

1.1 [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
1.2 [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
1.3 [another descriptive sentence, if necessary]
2. [the second aspect of the statement]

2.1 [a descriptive sentence corresponding to this aspect]
2.2 [another descriptive sentence, if necessary]
3. [another aspect of the statement, if necessary]
```

Here is an example to illustrate how to rephrase an input statement as the desired structure. Pay attention to 
numerical or enumeration indicators, like '1. ', '2. ', '(1) ', '(2) ', '- ', etc.

{example_1}

Here is another example to illustrate how to rephrase an input statement as the desired structure. When there are no 
explicit words indicating the statement's scope and main aspects, please use a few words to precisely summarize the 
scope as well as the main aspects. Then you may carefully attach the descriptive sentences to each main aspect.

{example_2}

Now summarize the "scope" of the following statement with a few words, and then rephrase the input statement to its 
"main aspects" and "corresponding descriptions" in the numerically ordered format strictly. 
Note that the aspect list should be precise and concise to conclude the statement, and the number of aspects should 
be limited.
Each description sentence must be completed and faithful to the original statement, and you should NOT remove any 
descriptive segment in this layer.

The water absorption curve of rice after soaking is an unimodal curve. The inflection point of the curve is the peak 
period of water absorption. The relationship between rice water absorption and time is non-linear and can be 
expressed by the following formula: a*t+b=c, where a, b, and c are constants. Under different humidity conditions, 
the change in the water absorption rate of rice with time is basically similar, that is, the water absorption rate is 
between 0 and the point d inflection, and the rate of change accelerates over time. After the inflection point, the 
increase in water absorption gradually stabilizes. The changing rules of water absorption and moisture content of 
rice are similar, but under different humidity conditions, the relationship between water absorption of rice and 
moisture content is different. When the moisture content is low, the water absorption of rice increases as the 
moisture content increases. When the moisture content is high, the increase in water absorption of rice gradually 
stabilizes. There are three obvious steps for rice seeds to absorb water: First, at the beginning of water absorption, 
the water content of the seeds gradually increases, and the water absorption rate slowly increases. Second, during 
the peak water absorption period, the water absorption rate increases rapidly. Third, in the later stage of water 
absorption, the water content of seeds slowly increases, and the water absorption rate increases. The water 
absorption rate of rice seeds is closely related to temperature. In general, water absorption increases as 
temperature increases. The relationship between water absorption and temperature can be expressed as: unsaturated 
water absorption (%) = 14.289T-10.719 (where T is temperature)

the analysis of Facebook stock, but it could be more precise by narrowing it down to just "stock prices." This is why 
the first part of the rephrased structure includes the phrase "market analysis of Facebook stock." In the second part, 
I identified two main aspects: the influence of hype and uneducated investors on stock prices, and the evaluation of 
Facebook's business model. Each aspect is further divided into several descriptive sentences that are faithful to the

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We accurately made the claims to reflect the paper’s contributions and scope
in Sec. 1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the limitation of our work in Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

28


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not involve theorems.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the experimental details in Sec. 4, Appendix A, and Ap-
pendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

29


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/struxgpt.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the experimental details in Sec. 4, Appendix A, and Ap-
pendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We show consistent improvements across three datasets with various models
in Sec. 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

30


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We reported the compute resource requirements in Appendix A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discussed the broader impacts of our method in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

31


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/struxgpt.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All our experimental data and models are open source and obtainable.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/struxgpt.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix A.3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We only hire annotators to label the structurization quality, as introduced in
Appendix A.3, which does not involve research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
