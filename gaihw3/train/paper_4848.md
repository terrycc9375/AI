Abstract

Estimating and disentangling epistemic uncertainty, uncertainty that is reducible
with more training data, and aleatoric uncertainty, uncertainty that is inherent to
the task at hand, is critically important when applying machine learning to high-
stakes applications such as medical imaging and weather forecasting. Conditional
diffusion models’ breakthrough ability to accurately and efficiently sample from the
posterior distribution of a dataset now makes uncertainty estimation conceptually
straightforward: One need only train and sample from a large ensemble of diffu-
sion models. Unfortunately, training such an ensemble becomes computationally
intractable as the complexity of the model architecture grows. In this work we in-
troduce a new approach to ensembling, hyper-diffusion models (HyperDM), which
allows one to accurately estimate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with a
single model. Unlike existing single-model uncertainty methods like Monte-Carlo
dropout and Bayesian neural networks, HyperDM offers prediction accuracy on
par with, and in some cases superior to, multi-model ensembles. Furthermore, our
proposed approach scales to modern network architectures such as Attention U-Net
and yields more accurate uncertainty estimates compared to existing methods. We
validate our method on two distinct real-world tasks: x-ray computed tomogra-
phy reconstruction and weather temperature forecasting. Source code is publicly

Introduction

Machine learning (ML) based inference and prediction algorithms are being actively adopted in a
range of high-stakes scientific and medical applications: ML is already deployed within modern
computed tomography (CT) scanners [10], ML is actively used to search for new medicines [29], and
over the last year ML has begun to compete with state-of-the-art weather and climate forecasting
systems [46, 36, 7]. In mission-critical tasks like weather forecasting and medical imaging/diagnosis,
the importance of reliable predictions cannot be overstated. The consequences of erroneous decisions
in these domains can range from massive financial costs to, more critically, the loss of human lives.
In this context, understanding and quantifying uncertainty is a pivotal step towards improving the
robustness and reliability of ML models.

diffusion model weights from randomly sampled noise. This process is repeated M times to obtain
an ensemble of M weights. (b) A diffusion model accepts fixed weights from the hyper-network
to stochastically generate a prediction. This process is repeated N times for each set of weights,
yielding a total of M × N predictions. (c) The ensemble predictions are aggregated to produce a
final prediction and an epistemic / aleatoric uncertainty map.

For an uncertainty estimate to be most useful, it must differentiate between aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty describes the fundamental variability and ill-posedness of the
inference task. By contrast, epistemic uncertainty describes the inference model’s lack of knowledge
or understanding—which can be reduced with more diverse training data. Distinguishing between
these two types of uncertainty provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of a
predictive model, offering pathways towards improving its performance. In applications like weather
forecasting, epistemic uncertainty can be used to inform the optimal placement of new weather
stations. Additionally, in medical imaging, decomposition of uncertainty into its aleatoric and
epistemic components is important for identifying out-of-distribution measurements where model
predictions should be verified by trained experts.

This work presents a new approach for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty using a single
model. Specifically, our approach uses a novel pipeline integrating a conditional diffusion model [23]
and a Bayesian hyper-network [34] to generate an ensemble of predictions. Conditional diffusion
models allow one to sample from an implicit representation of the posterior distribution of an inverse
problem. Meanwhile, hyper-networks allow one to sample over a collection of networks that are
consistent with the training data. Together, these components can efficiently estimate both sources of
uncertainty, without sacrificing inference accuracy. Our specific contributions are summarized below:

Uncertainty Quantification

Probabilistic methods are commonly used to estimate uncertainty by first generating an ensemble
of models and subsequently quantifying uncertainty as the variance or entropy over the ensemble’s
predictions [11]. Deep ensembles [35] explicitly train such an ensemble to predict epistemic un-
certainty. However, with modern neural network architectures exceeding a billion parameters, the
computational cost required to train deep ensembles is prohibitively expensive.

Other methods attempt to approximate deep ensembles while circumventing its training overhead.
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) [40, 44] use variational inference [19, 65] to model the posterior
weight distribution. Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout [18] leverages dropout [57] to stochastically induce
variability in the network’s predictions. Recent works in weather forecasting [7, 46] perturb network
inputs with random noise to similarly generate stochastic predictions. Still, each of these methods
has notable trade-offs preventing their widespread adoption. BNNs incur a runtime cost that scales
proportionally with the number of model parameters, leading to slow inference and training times.
MC dropout and input perturbation introduce noise into the inference process, which adversely affects
model prediction quality. Moreover, perturbing inputs with noise is not equivalent to deep ensembles
(in the Bayesian sense) as these methods optimize the weights of a single, deterministic model.

A separate branch of research [48, 3] explores distribution-free uncertainty estimation, which uses
conformal prediction [4] and quantile regression [32] to estimate bounds on aleatoric uncertainty.
Subsequent works [58] have extended this to additionally estimate epistemic uncertainty; however,
these methods use deep ensembles to do so—leading to similar issues with computational complexity.

2.2
Hyper-Networks

Hyper-networks [20] employ a unique paradigm where one network—the “hyper-network”—
generates weights for another “primary” network. This framework circumvents the need to train
multiple task-specific or dataset-specific models. Instead, one need only train a single hyper-network
to cover a range of tasks or datasets. Given an input token representing a specific task, a hyper-network
learns to generate reasonable weights with which the primary network can accomplish that task [61].
Note that, during training, losses are back-propagated such that only the hyper-network’s parameters
are updated while the primary network’s weights are purely generated by the hyper-network.

datasets with aleatoric uncertainty determined by noise variance σ2
η. Variances across diffusion model
predictions are visualized as one distribution per training dataset. Aleatoric estimates (i.e., the mean
of each distribution) accurately predict σ2
η. (b) HyperDM is trained on four datasets with epistemic
uncertainty determined by dataset size |D|. Prediction means are visualized as one distribution per
training dataset. Epistemic estimates (i.e., the variance of each distribution) grow inversely with |D|.

Bayesian hyper-networks (BHNs) [34, 33] extend hyper-networks to quantify uncertainty. Rather
than accepting task-specific tokens as inputs, BHNs accept random noise and stochastically generate
weights for the primary network. BHNs thus serve as an implicit representation for the true posterior
weight distribution [47, 28]. Epistemic uncertainty is measured as the variance across predictions
yielded by the primary network for different weights sampled from the BHN.

2.3
Diffusion Models

Diffusion models (DMs) [52, 55, 56] represent a class of generative machine learning models that
learns to sample from a target distribution. These models fit to the Stein score function [39] of
the target distribution by iteratively transitioning between an easy-to-sample (typically Gaussian)
distribution and the target distribution. During training, samples from the target distribution are
corrupted by running the forward “noising” diffusion process, and the network learns to estimate the
added noise. To generate samples, the network iteratively denoises images of pure noise until they
looks like they were sampled from the target distribution [23]. DMs have shown success in generating
high-quality, realistic images and capturing diverse data distributions [12]. To date, however, there
has been limited research [6] investigating the use of DMs for uncertainty estimation.

Problem Definition

Given measurements y ∼Y corresponding to signals of interest x ∼X, our objective is to train a
model which can simultaneously recover x and quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of its
predictions. The predictive distribution of a such a model is given by

p(x|y, D) =
Z
p(x|y, ϕ)p(ϕ|D)dϕ
(1)

where p(x|y, ϕ) is the likelihood function, and p(ϕ|D) is the posterior over model parameters ϕ for a
training dataset D [59]. Uncertainty on this distribution stems from two distinct sources: aleatoric
uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty [13].

3.1
Aleatoric Uncertainty

Aleatoric uncertainty (AU) arises from inherent randomness in the underlying measurement process
and is represented by the likelihood function in Equation (1). Most notably, this source of uncertainty
is irreducible for a given measurement process [17, 30]. In the context of predictive modeling, AU
represents how ill-posed the task is and is often associated with noise, measurement errors, or inherent
unpredictability in the observed phenomena.

---Page Break---
Consider an inverse problem where the goal is to recover x from measurements
y = F(x) + η,
(2)
defined by forward operator F and non-zero measurement noise η ∼N(0, σ2), by learning the
inverse mapping F−1 : Y →X. Even with a perfect model capable of sampling from the true
likelihood p(x|y), irreducible errors are still present due to the ambiguity η around which x ∼p(x)
explains the observed measurement y. This ambiguity captures the inherent randomness (i.e., the
aleatoric uncertainty) of the inverse problem and is measured by the variance σ2 of η [27].

3.2
Epistemic Uncertainty

Epistemic uncertainty (EU) relates to a lack of knowledge or incomplete understanding of a problem
and is reducible with additional training data [27]. This type of uncertainty reflects limitations in
a model’s knowledge and its ability to accurately capture underlying patterns in the data. Assume
we initialize M models with random weights {ϕi}M
i=0 and sufficient capacity to perfectly capture
the inverse model described in Section 3.1. After training, discrepancies (i.e., epistemic uncertainty)
inevitably arise in the final weights learned by each model, due to the random weight initialization pro-
cess. As additional training data is provided, model weights converge more strongly—corresponding
to a reduction in EU [11, 27].

Method

We measure uncertainty using variance and apply the law of total variance [11, 60, 50] to decompose
total uncertainty (TU) across model predictions ˆX ∼p(x|y, D) into its AU and EU components

Var( ˆX) = Varϕ∼p(ϕ|D)

The first term captures the explainable uncertainty, given by the variance of sampled weights ϕ ∼
p(ϕ|D) over the expected values of samples ˆx ∼p(x|y, ϕ) from the likelihood function. This term
ignores variance caused by the ill-posedness of the likelihood function and therefore represents EU.
The second term captures the unexplainable uncertainty and is given by the expectation of sampled
weights ϕ ∼p(ϕ|D) over the variance of samples ˆx ∼p(x|y, ϕ) from the likelihood function. This
term ignores variance caused by the sampling of weights from the posterior and therefore represents
AU.

Both the likelihood function p(ϕ|D) and the posterior p(x|y, ϕ) do not have an explicit closed-form,
making computation of (3) intractable. To circumvent this, we instead learn their respective implicit
distributions [28, 47] q(ϕ) and q(x|y).

4.1
Implicit Likelihood Function

As demonstrated in [55], DMs enable sampling from an implicit conditional distribution q(x|y) by
learning to invert a diffusion process that gradually transforms a target data distribution into a simple
(typically Gaussian) data distribution [56]. The forward diffusion process can be described by a T
length Markov chain

q(x(t)|x(t−1)) := N

x(t);
q

1 −σ2
t x(t−1), σ2
t


(4)

that transforms samples x(0) from the data distribution into samples x(T ) from a Gaussian distribu-
tion [23]. Conversely, the reverse diffusion process

p(x(t−1)|x(t), y) := N(x(t−1); x(t) + σ2
t ∇x(t) log p(x(t)|y), σ2
t )
(5)
transforms pure noise into samples from p(x|y) [63].

Since explicit computation of the score function ∇xt log p(x(t)|y) is intractable [16], a neural network
s(x, t|y, ϕ) is typically trained to approximate it via an L2 minimization objective

E(x,y)∼D

∇x(t) log p(x(t)|y) −s(x(t), t|y, ϕ)

other methods, HyperDM is best able to isolate the abnormal feature in its epistemic estimate.

where D = {(x0, y0), . . . , (xN, yN)} represents the training dataset. Once the DM has finished
training, we can sample from the implicit likelihood function q(x|y) by first sampling random noise
x(T ) ∼N(0, σ2) and iteratively denoising the image T times following Equation (5) to obtain
x(0) ∼q(x|y) [42].

4.2
Implicit Posterior Distribution

Similar to the likelihood function, the posterior weight distribution has no explicit closed-form
representation, so we instead make use of an implicit distribution q(ϕ) to approximate p(ϕ|D).
As mentioned in Section 2.2, BHNs [34] enable sampling from q(ϕ) by transforming samples
z ∼N(0, σ2) into weights ϕ ∼q(ϕ) for the primary network. In the case of the inverse imaging
problem from Section 3.1, the primary network would be a network f(·|ϕ) with parameters ϕ that
learns the inverse mapping from measurements to signals Y →X.

Training a BHN differs from conventional deep learning methods in that the weights of the primary
network ϕ are generated by a hyper-network and are thus not learnable parameters. Instead, the
weights θ of a BHN hθ are optimized via the minimization objective

E(x,y)∼D,z∼N(0,σ2)
h
∥f(y | hθ(z)) −x∥2
2
i
(7)

where hθ maps random input vectors z ∼N(0, σ2) to weights ϕ (see Figure 1a). Importantly,
weights produced by the BHN do not collapse to a mode because there are many network weights
which yield plausible predictions with respect to L2 distance. As less data is available during training,
a broader range of network weights reasonably explain that data.

4.3
Estimation of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with a Single Model

We leverage DMs and BHNs to implicitly model p(x|y, ϕ) and p(ϕ|D), respectively, thus enabling
sampling from both distributions. Specifically, our framework consists of a BHN hθ that generates
weights ϕi ∼q(ϕ) for a DM s(·|ϕ), which we collectively refer to as a hyper-diffusion model
(HyperDM). At inference time, we sample i ∈M weights from hθ and for each weight ϕi generate
j ∈N samples from s(·|ϕi)—yielding a distribution of M × N predictions ˆxi,j (see Figure 1).
This framework is a transformation of Equation (1), where both posterior and likelihood have been
replaced with implicit distributions to yield a tractable approximation of the predictive distribution

p(x|y, D) ≈
Z
q(x|y)q(ϕ)dϕ.

i
.
(11)

Compared to other aggregation methods (e.g., median, mode), we observe the best performance when
taking the ensemble mean. Please refer to Figure 5 and Table 3 in the supplement for more details.

Unlike deep ensembles which require training M distinct models to compute EU and AU, HyperDM
only requires training a single model (i.e., a BHN)—theoretically consuming up to M-fold fewer
computational resources. Furthermore, unlike many pseudo-ensembling methods [18, 7, 46], Hy-
perDM doesn’t need to exploit randomness caused by perturbations to model p(ϕ|D)—avoiding
adverse effects on model performance. Moreover, unlike BNNs, HyperDM is relatively cheap to
sample from in terms of computational runtime and resources—making it significantly faster and
more scalable compared to BNN-based uncertainty estimation methods.

Differing from prior work [60], we make no Gaussian assumptions on the predictive distribution
p(x|y, D) nor on the likelihood function p(x|y, ϕ). This is because our method approximates p(x|y, ϕ)
by repeatedly sampling ˆx ∼q(x|y) from a DM, rather than explicitly modeling the distribution as a
Gaussian with mean µ and variance σ2. Therefore, our aggregate predictive distribution p(x|y, D)
is not restricted to a Gaussian mixture model N(µ∗(x), σ2
∗(x)) over the collective mean µ∗and
variance σ2
∗of all ensemble members.

Experiments

Please refer to Appendix A for training details (e.g., network architectures and loss functions).

Baselines. We focus on comparing HyperDM against methods which are similarly capable of
estimating both EU and AU. Our benchmark consists of a state-of-the-art method, deep-posterior
sampling for uncertainty quantification [14] (henceforth referred to as DPS-UQ), and a dropout-based
method (referred to as MC-Dropout). DPS-UQ is implemented as an M-member ensemble of
deep-posterior sampling (DPS) DMs. MC-Dropout is implemented as a single DM with weights
sampled from q(ϕ) using dropout instead of a BHN. Despite its inability to jointly predict EU and
AU, we also include a BNN baseline in our initial experiments to illustrate the advantages of our
method in terms of prediction speed and accuracy.

Metrics. We evaluate the quality of baseline predictions using both full-reference image quality met-
rics and distribution-based metrics. Specifically, we compute peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) [24]
and structural similarity index (SSIM) [62] between mean predictions (see Equation (11)) and their
corresponding ground truth references. We also compute the continuous ranked probability score
(CRPS) [41] as a holistic indicator of the quality of ˆX, given by

CRPS(F, a) =
Z ∞

−∞
[F(a) −1a≥x]2 da,
(12)

7


---Page Break---
where F is the cumulative distribution function of ˆX and 1 is the Heaviside step function.

In our initial experiments, we compare baseline estimates of AU and EU against ground truth
uncertainty. However, extending such validation to more complex tasks and datasets is difficult
because uncertainty is affected by a wide variety of environmental factors (e.g., measurement noise,
sampling rates) which are often unreported. As a result, in subsequent experiments, we follow [14] and
evaluate uncertainty by generating out-of-distribution (OOD) measurements and verifying whether
baseline estimates of c
EU correctly predict OOD pixels.

5.1
Toy Problem

We first evaluate our method on a toy inverse problem to establish the correctness of our uncertainty
estimates under a simple forward model where ground truth uncertainty is explicitly quantifiable.
Training datasets are generated using the function

x = sin(y) + η
(13)

where η ∼N(0, σ2
η) and measurements y ∼U(−5, 5). We conduct two separate experiments to
validate our method’s ability to estimate uncertainty against ground-truth EU and AU.

Estimating AU. To test our method’s ability to estimate AU, we generate four training datasets using
Equation (13) with ground truth AU characterized by noise variances σ2
η ∈{0.01, 0.04, 0.16, 0.64}.
Each training dataset has |D| = 500 examples, and a HyperDM is trained on each dataset for 500
epochs. After training, we sample M = 10 weights from hθ and N = 10000 realizations from s(·|ϕ)
to obtain a distribution of M × N predictions. We compute c
AU for each ensemble member using
Equation (9) and visualize Varj∈N[ ˆX] across all M weights in Figure 2a. The AU estimates across
the four datasets are c
AU = {0.02, 0.05, 0.21, 0.64}, which closely match the ground-truth.

Estimating EU. We test our method’s ability to estimate EU by generating four training datasets of
varying sizes |D| ∈{100, 200, 400, 800} and fixed noise variance σ2
η = 0.01. Unlike AU, ground
truth EU cannot be explicitly quantified because it is independent from the training data [5]. As a
result, we follow prior works [35, 13, 38] and validate EU qualitatively. We train a HyperDM on
each dataset for 500 epochs and draw M × N samples from it where M = 10, N = 10000. We then
calculate c
EU using Equation (10) and plot Ej∈N[ ˆX] for all M weights in Figure 2b. The EU estimates
across the four datasets are c
EU =

1.92 × 10−4, 2.20 × 10−5, 1.17 × 10−5, 1.83 × 10−6	
, ordered
by increasing |D|. As expected, c
EU decreases as |D| grows increasingly larger.

To highlight the key advantages of HyperDM over traditional uncertainty estimation techniques,
we also train a BNN on the same datasets and sample M = 10000 predictions. The resulting
estimates c
EU = {0.091, 0.071, 0.050, 0.012} indicate a similar inversely proportional relationship
with |D|. However, despite having the same backbone architecture and training hyper-parameters, we
observe aggregate predictions of lower individual and mean quality from the BNN when compared to
HyperDM (see Table 4 of the supplement). Moreover, we observe that BNNs take over 2× longer to
train compared to HyperDM (i.e., 70 seconds vs. 30 seconds), and inference is an order of magnitude
slower (i.e., 8.7 seconds vs. 0.7 seconds to generate 10,000 predictions), due to BNN’s need to
sample from the weight distribution at runtime.

5.2
Computed Tomography

In this experiment, we demonstrate our method’s applicability for medical imaging tasks, specifically
CT reconstruction. Using the Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) [51] dataset, we form a target
image distribution X by extracting 1,200 CT images, applying 4× pixel binning to produce 128×128
resolution images, and normalizing each image by mapping pixel values between [−1000, 3000]
Hounsfield units to the interval [−1, 1]. We subsequently compute the sparse Radon transform with
45 projected views and add Gaussian noise with variance σ2 = 0.16 to the resulting sinograms. Using
filtered back-projection (FBP) [25], we obtain low-quality reconstructions Y of original images X.
The dataset is finally split into a training dataset comprised of 1,000 image-measurement pairs and
a validation dataset of 200 data pairs. Following the training procedure described in Appendix A,
we train MC-Dropout, DPS-UQ, and HyperDM on LUNA16. For fair comparison, all baselines are
sampled from using M = 10 and N = 100 for a total of M × N = 1000 predictions. We refrain

required to scale to the image domain.

In Table 2, we show average CRPS, PSNR, and SSIM scores computed over the test dataset. The rel-
atively low image quality scores obtained by MC-Dropout are indicative of the adverse effects caused
by randomly dropping network weights at inference time. Meanwhile, DPS-UQ reconstructions
achieve a 15.5% higher average PSNR than MC-Dropout, but at the cost of an eight-fold increase
in training time (see Table 1). On the other hand, HyperDM yields predictions of similar—and
sometimes better—quality than DPS-UQ while only adding a 3% overhead in training time compared
to MC-Dropout. Note that the discrepancy in training times between DPS-UQ and HyperDM will
continually widen as we scale the ensemble size beyond M = 10. However, due to the high computa-
tional costs required to train M > 10 member deep ensembles, we limited baselines to ten-member
ensembles for this experiment.

To evaluate the quality of baseline uncertainty predictions, we first select a random in-distribution
image x ∈X and generate its corresponding OOD measurement by first artificially inserting an
abnormal feature (i.e., metal implants along the spinal column) and subsequently computing the
corresponding FBP measurement y. Results in Figure 4 show that DPS-UQ and HyperDM yield
comparable results in that their c
EU predictions successfully highlight the OOD implant. In contrast,
MC-Dropout fails to highlight OOD pixels in its c
EU prediction. While prior work [43] suggests that
AU estimates are unreliable—and should be subsequently disregarded—whenever EU is high, we
nonetheless include c
AU results in Figure 4 to demonstrate that HyperDM produces c
AU predictions
similar to that of a deep ensemble.

5.3
Weather Forecasting

In this experiment, we demonstrate the applicability of HyperDM for climate science—specifically
two-meter surface temperature forecasting. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset [22], we generate a dataset comprised of 1,240 surface air
temperature maps sampled at six-hour time intervals (i.e., 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) in January between
2009-2018. Images are binned down to 128 × 128 resolution and normalized such that pixel values
between [210, 313] Kelvin map to the interval [−1, 1]. Following experiments done in [46], we form
data pairs (x, y) using historical temperature data at time t as the initial measurement image y and
data at time t + 6 hours as the target image x. A total of 200 images are held-out and used for
validation and testing purposes.

Using the same training procedure as Section 5.2, we train MC-Dropout, DPS-UQ, and HyperDM on
ERA5 and generate predictions with sampling rates M = 10 and N = 100. Baseline PSNR, SSIM,

---Page Break---
and CRPS scores are reported in Table 2, where we observe trends similar to the prior experiment:
DPS-UQ achieves a 5% higher average PSNR score compared to MC-Dropout, and HyperDM
achieves 1% higher average PSNR score compared to DPS-UQ. Training overhead for DPS-UQ
remains around 8× that of MC-Dropout and HyperDM due to the need to repeat training M times.

To generate OOD measurements, we first obtain an in-distribution measurement and subsequently
insert an anomalous hot spot over northeastern Canada. Inspecting results in Figure 3, we observe
that HyperDM’s c
EU prediction more accurately identifies OOD pixels than DPS-UQ. In contrast,
MC-Dropout fails to identify the hot spot in its c
EU prediction and instead incorrectly identifies
regions in the central United States as OOD. Interestingly, all methods predict lower c
AU over the
ocean versus the North American continent, which aligns with our expectations, as water has less
temperature variability compared to land due to its higher specific heat. Additional qualitative results
showing the decomposition of c
TU into its c
EU and c
AU components are provided in Figure 8 of the
supplement.

Limitations and Future Work

We acknowledge two main limitations of our approach and identify potential avenues for improvement.
Firstly, as a consequence of their iterative denoising process, inference on DMs is slow compared to
inference on classical neural network architectures. However, recent advances in accelerated sampling
strategies have largely mitigated this issue and allow for few [53] (and in some cases single [54])
step sampling from DMs. Secondly, hyper-networks suffer from a scalability problem in that their
number of parameters scales with the number of primary network parameters. This stems from the
fact that the dimensionality of the hyper-network’s output layer is (in most cases) proportional to the
number of parameters in the primary network [9]. Several works address this issue by proposing more
efficient weight generation strategies [61, 2, 26]. Nonetheless, these problems remain a promising
avenue for future research.

Conclusion

The growing application of ML to impactful scientific and medical problems has made accurate
estimation of uncertainty more important than ever. Unfortunately, the gold standard for uncertainty
estimation—deep ensembles—is prohibitively expensive to train, especially on modern network
architectures containing billions of parameters. In this work, we propose HyperDM, a framework
capable of approximating deep ensembles at a fraction of the computational training cost. Specifically,
we combine Bayesian hyper-networks and diffusion models to generate a distribution of predictions
with which we can estimate total uncertainty and its epistemic and aleatoric sub-components. Our
experiments on weather forecasting and CT reconstruction demonstrate that HyperDM significantly
outperforms pseudo-ensembling techniques like Bayesian neural networks and Monte Carlo dropout
in terms of prediction quality. Moreover, when compared against deep ensembles, HyperDM achieves
up to an M× reduction in training time while yielding predictions of similar (if not superior) quality,
where M is the ensemble size. This work thus makes a major stride towards developing accurate and
scalable estimates of uncertainty.

Training Details

All baselines are trained on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 using a batch size of 32, an Adam [31]
optimizer, and a learning rate of 1 × 10−4. Training is run over 500 epochs in our initial experiment
and 400 epochs in our CT and weather experiments. DMs are trained using a Markov chain of
T = 100 timesteps.

A.1
Network Architecture

The backbone architecture for all baselines (i.e., BNN, DPS-UQ, HyperDM) in the toy experiment
from Section 5.1 is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [49] with five linear layers and rectified linear
unit (ReLU) [1] activation functions. For experiments described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, we scale
the DM’s backbone architecture up to an Attention U-Net [45] for all baselines. The U-Net consists
of an initial 2D convolutional layer, followed by four 2× downsampling ResNet [21] blocks, two
middle ResNet blocks, four 2× upsampling ResNet blocks, and a final 2D convolutional layer. Each
ResNet block consists of two 2D convolutional layers—with group normalization [64] and Sigmoid
Linear Units (SiLU) [15] activation function—as well an additional attention layer.

A.2
Loss Functions

The training procedure for HyperDM is identical to that of a standard DM, except that the DM’s
weights are sampled from a BHN hθ. For each training pair (x, y), we sample DM weights by first
sampling random noise z ∼N(0, σ2
z), z ∈R8 and then computing ϕ ∼hθ(z). We manually set the
DM weights equal to ϕ and compute the loss function

LHyperDM = ∥ϵ −s(x(t), t|y, hθ(z))∥2
2,
(14)

where ϵ ∼N(0, σ2) is the noise added to x at time step t and s(·|ϕ) represents the DM. In general,
we found HyperDM training to be stable across a variety of training hyper-parameters and did not
encounter any over-fitting issues.

We follow [37] and train our BNN baseline b(·|ϕ) by minimizing the loss function

LBNN = ∥x −b(y|ϕ)∥2
2 + λKL(q(ϕ) ∥p(ϕ|D)),
(15)

which consists of a data fidelity term and an additional Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term
between the true posterior p(ϕ|D) and the implicit distribution q(ϕ)—approximated using Bayes by
Backprop [8]. The weights of each BNN layer are sampled from a zero-mean normal distribution with
standard deviation σ = 0.1, and the KL component of the loss term is down-weighted by λ = 0.01.

The training procedure for DPS-UQ and MC-Dropout are identical in that they share the same loss
objective
LDPS-UQ = LMC-Dropout = ∥ϵ −s(x(t), t|y, ϕ)∥2
2,
(16)
where the weights ϕ are randomly initialized at the start of training and updated via backpropagation.
However, we train M separate DM instances for DPS-UQ, whereas only a single DM is trained for
MC-Dropout.

To build a predictive distribution of size M × N with MC-Dropout, we first seed a pseudo-random
number generator (RNG), which we use to deterministically sample dropout masks from a Bernoulli
distribution. These masks are used to zero-out input tensor elements at each network layer. We
then reset the RNG using the same initial seed—fixing the drop-out configuration—and continually
sample from the DM until we obtain N predictions for that seed. This process is repeated across M
different seeds for a total of M × N predictions. In all experiments, we train and test MC-Dropout
with dropout probability p = 0.3.

Ablation Studies

B.1
Sampling Rates

HyperDM provides flexibility at inference time to arbitrarily choose the number of network weights
M to sample—analogous to the number of ensemble members in a deep ensemble—and the number
of predictions N to generate per sampled weight. In this study, we examine the effect of sampling
rates M, N on c
EU and c
AU on our OOD experiment from Section 5.3.

In our first test, we estimate EU on an OOD measurement for fixed N = 100 and variable M =
{2, 4, 8, 16}. Results in Figure 6 indicate that under-sampling weights (i.e., M ≤4) leads to
uncertainty maps which underestimate uncertainty around OOD features and overestimate uncertainty
around in-distribution features. However, as we continue to sample additional network weights,
we observe increased uncertainty in areas around the abnormal feature and suppressed uncertainty
around in-distribution features. This result indicates the importance of large ensembles in correctly
isolating OOD features from in-distribution features for EU estimation.

In our second test, we repeat the same process but instead fix M = 10 and sample N = {2, 4, 8, 16}
predictions from the DM. Examining the results shown in Figure 7, we observe irregular peaks in
the predicted AU at low sampling rates N ≤4. However, as we sample more from the DM and the
sample mean converges, c
AU becomes more uniformly spread across the entire continental landmass.
This result suggests the importance of sampling a large number of predictions for adequately capturing
the characteristics of the true likelihood distribution.

M of sampled weights from the hyper-network, uncertainty around out-of-distribution features (i.e.,
the hot spot in the upper-right) grows and uncertainty around in-distribution features (i.e., everything
else in the image) shrinks.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our claims accurately reflect our contributions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: Section 4 lists assumptions and provides relevant references where proofs can
be found.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our method is fully described. Anonymized code that can replicate our method
is provided in the supplementary materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

21


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Anonymized code that can replicate our method is provided in the supplemen-
tary materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details can be found in Section A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Not all our experiments include errors bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

22


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our hardware resources are described in Section A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research is compliant.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the positive societal benefits of our work in the introduction and
elsewhere. We do not foresee any negative societal impact.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

23


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our uncertainty estimation method does not present obvious opportunities for
misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We created all figures ourselves. We used PyTorch, which is disclosed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The anonymized code in the supplement includes a readme and requirement
list.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No humans subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [No]
Justification: No IRB required. No research with humans.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
