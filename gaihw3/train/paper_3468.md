Abstract

Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs)
excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following.
However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in
their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their
own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context
Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal ex-
perience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task
demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the tra-
jectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating
cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals,
and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved and
adapted through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory
in a similar environment. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in
the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM
and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent’s library of examples grows, it becomes
more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment
interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in
dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in Visu-
alWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6%
improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate
improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action
forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with super-
vised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields
additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual
prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action
plans that lack such abstractions.

Introduction

Humans exhibit remarkable few-shot learning capabilities, rapidly generalizing from a single task
demonstration to related conditions by integrating the observed behavior with their internal world
model. They discern what is relevant and irrelevant for success and anticipate potential failures.
Through repeated practice and feedback, they quickly find the right abstraction that helps to imitate
and adapt the task to various situations. This process facilitates continuous refinement and transfer of
knowledge across a diverse range of tasks and contexts.

Figure 1: ICAL (In-Context Abstraction Learning) is a method for efficient agent learning from both
noisy visual demonstrations and human feedback using large language / vision models. Left: The
agent can take in a video demonstration, and generate a refined example with language annotations to
be used later by the VLM via in-context learning. Right: Humans provide feedback, correct errors
and supply additional knowledge.

Recent research has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) and visual-language mod-
els (VLMs) 1 to extract high-level insights from trajectories and experiences.
These insights
are generated through the model’s introspection and are used to enhance performance by ap-
pending them to prompts, leveraging their strong in-context learning abilities [39, 70, 56, 60].
Existing methods often linguistically focus on task reward signals [70, 56, 76, 79], store hu-
man corrections following failures [88, 15, 68], use domain experts to hand-write or hand-pick
examples without introspection [68, 73], or utilize language to shape policies [30, 74] and re-
wards [61, 3, 27, 21, 26, 59, 74, 35, 54]. Critically, these methods typically are text-based and do not
incorporate any visuals cues or demonstrations, or use introspection only in case of failures, which is
only one of several ways that humans and machines can consolidate experiences and extract insights.

In this work, we teach VLMs novel tasks by learning in-context experience abstractions given
sub-optimal demonstrations and human natural language feedback. We present In-Context
Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that prompts VLMs to create multimodal abstractions for
unfamiliar domains. Unlike previous works that only store and retrieve successful action plans
or trajectories [68, 76, 44], our approach emphasizes learning abstractions that encapsulate the
dynamics and critical knowledge of tasks, as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, ICAL tackles four
types of cognitive abstractions: task and causal relationships, which identify the fundamental
principles or actions needed to achieve a goal and how elements are interconnected through cause
and effect [75]; changes in object states, which describe the various forms or conditions an object
will take [4]; temporal abstractions, which break down tasks into subgoals [6]; and task construals,
which highlight critical visual details within a task [31]. When provided with optimal or suboptimal
demonstrations, ICAL prompts a VLM to transform these demonstrations into optimized trajectories

1Throughout the remainder of the paper, we refer to multimodal large language models capable of processing
both text and images (e.g., GPT-4V) as ‘VLMs’.

while also creating pertinent language and visual abstractions. These abstractions are then refined
through executing the trajectory in the environment, guided by natural language feedback from
humans. Each step of abstraction generation leverages previously derived abstractions, enabling the
model to improve not only its execution but its abstraction capabilities as well. Collectively, the
learned abstractions summarize crucial information about action sequences, state transitions, rules,
and focus areas, articulated through free-form natural language and visual representations.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of our agent, equipped with the learned example abstrac-
tions, across three benchmarks: TEACh [63] for dialogue-based instruction in household settings,
VisualWebArena [37] for multimodal autonomous web tasks, and Ego4D for video action anticipa-
tion [28]. In TEACh, our agent sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming VLM agents reliant on raw
demonstrations or extensive domain-expert hand-written examples, demonstrating the effectiveness
of ICAL learned abstractions for in-context learning. Specifically, our approach achieves a 12.6%
improvement in goal condition success compared to the previous SOTA, HELPER [68]. We show
that this approach leads to increasing performance gains on unseen tasks as the external memory
grows, and achieves a 14.7% performance increase after only ten examples. Moreover, our agent
becomes increasingly efficient over time by leveraging stored abstractions, requiring 38.8% fewer
environment steps and 71.6% less human feedback per example in the latter half of demonstrations
processed. Integrating our learned examples with LoRA-based fine-tuning of an LLM [32] further
improves goal-condition performance by 4.9%. In the VisualWebArena, our agent surpasses the
state-of-the-art, GPT4 + Set of Marks [37], improving from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V and from
18.9% to 23.4% using GPT4o. In the Ego4D setting, ICAL outperforms few-shot GPT4V using chain
of thought, reducing the noun and action edit distance by 6.4 and 1.7, respectively, and competes
closely with fully supervised methods, despite using 639x less in-domain training data. Our approach
significantly reduces reliance on expertly-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context
learning from action plans or trajectories that lack such abstractions [68, 76, 44].

Related Work

VLM Agents
LLMs and VLMs trained from large scale vision-language data have been adapted
for task planning and decision making tasks through in-context prompt optimization or finetuning.
VLMs have been used to plan over high-level actions or code [80, 76, 68, 44, 72], incorporate error
feedback [52, 45, 88], and understanding game instruction manuals [83]. Some studies use VLMs
for learning from human feedback through retrievable knowledge [88], question asking [66, 15],
or converting language to actions or rewards [49, 50, 36, 11, 14]. Our work utilizes noisy visual
demonstrations, and integrates multiple types of multi-modal abstractions during the learning process.

Instructable Interactive Agents
Benchmarks for embodied instruction following include question
answering [25, 16, 93, 18, 17, 23], navigation [42, 41, 10], interactive dialogue, and instruction
following [86, 71, 63, 22]. Virtual agent benchmarks focus on web tasks where agents navigate
static [53, 19] and dynamic web environments [92, 37, 85, 38], covering personal shopping, travel
assistance, software engineering, and operating system tasks [51, 34, 69, 47]. This includes visual
grounding and multi-turn planning, with prior studies using finetuning or few-shot prompts. In
agent-based domains, retrieval-augmented prompting and prompt optimization have improved task
planning in instructional contexts [73] and open-world gaming [79, 76, 56, 62]. Unlike studies
that rely solely on static external memory or text-based prompting, our research demonstrates that
multi-modal, generalizable abstractions learned from a few noisy trajectories and human feedback
via in-context learning or finetuning can significantly enhance instruction-following performance.

In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL)

In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL) aims at automating the acquisition of generalizable examples
and knowledge for in-context agents. ICAL operates by receiving a language instruction I with a
noisy trajectory of observations and actions, denoted ξnoisy = {o0, a0, . . . , oT , aT } in a new task
domain D. A new domain D represents changes in task variables not captured in VLM pretraining,
such as a different environment (e.g., kitchen #1 vs. kitchen #2), task (e.g., "add the cheapest red bike
to my wish list"), or user preference (e.g., "I prefer the red cup for coffee"). The core aim of ICAL
is to abstract each noisy trajectory into a single example e, which then forms part of a memory set

Given a noisy trajectory, It prompts a VLM to optimize actions and add language annotations. The
optimized trajectory is executed, incorporating human feedback on failures. Successful examples are

(left), and the final abstracted example after ICAL (right).

M. Each example e ∈M represents an optimized trajectory ξoptimized with generalizable language
abstractions L. The objective is to ensure that M collectively encapsulates examples that, when used
in a VLMs context window, increase the likelihood of successful task execution in the new domain,
while also containing knowledge that is transferable across similar tasks and contexts. This can be
encapsulated as:

max
M E[R|M, I, ot, D],
(1)

where R is the return or the cumulative reward acquired by performing actions based on the instruction
I, observation ot, and in-context example memory set M. Rather than using reinforcement learning
to optimize prompt examples through trial and error—which would lead to a challenging search
problem that myopically focuses on improving rewards for the current scene—we leverage VLMs’
knowledge for abstraction, which we elicit through prompting.

Overview

Figure 2 shows an overview of ICAL. Each iteration starts with a noisy trajectory. ICAL abstracts
it in two phases: (1) abstraction phase (Fabstract), where a VLM corrects errors and enriches the
sequence with language comments (Section 3.2). During this phase, a VLM identifies and corrects
errors within the sequence, as well as enriches it with natural language comments. (2) The human-
in-the-loop phase, denoted Fhitl, during which the sequence is executed within the environment
and its abstraction is guided by human feedback conveyed in natural language (Section 3.3). Upon
the successful execution of the trajectory, it is archived within a continually growing repository of
examples. These examples serve as contextual references for the agent both during its learning phase
and during inference for unseen instructions and environments.

3.2
VLM-driven Abstraction Generation

We address the challenge of learning from a diverse set of noisy trajectories ξnoisy
=
{o0, a0, . . . , oT , aT }, which may be sub-optimal due to several factors: demonstrations by human
non-experts, errors in inferring actions from visual passive demonstrations, and generated paths that
include exploration or failures. Please see Section 4.1 for details on noisy trajectory collection.

Abstracting a noisy trajectory, ξnoisy, involves transforming it into a more optimized sequence,
ξoptimized, and formulating relevant language abstractions, L, as shown in Figure 2. The abstraction
function, Fabstract, modifies ξnoisy by correcting actions and generating language abstractions that
encapsulate general knowledge and task-specific insights. It is defined as:

Fabstract : (ξnoisy, I, {e1, . . . , ek}) →(ξoptimized, L)
(2)

where ξnoisy is the initial noisy trajectory, I is the task instruction, and {e1, . . . , ek} are the top-k
previous successful in-context examples. The output consists of the optimized trajectory ξoptimized
and language abstractions L.

Corrections during abstraction include action adjustments and generating annotations (L) for ab-
stracting subgoals, causal relationships, state changes, and reasoning steps. These annotations are
produced by prompting the VLM to output a specified type of abstraction. We prompt the VLM
abstraction function, Fabstract (GPT4V in this work), to produce the abstractions detailed below. For
the complete prompts, please refer to the Appendix.

1. Task and Causal Abstractions: Task and causal abstractions pinpoint the essential principles or
actions required to achieve a goal and explain how elements are interconnected through cause and
effect. Task and causal abstractions have been shown to be helpful in improving LLM generaliza-
tion [56], and play a strong role in human communication and learning [75, 24]. We prompt the VLM
to add annotations of task and causal abstractions in the form of natural language comments. For
example, it might add a note explaining unnecessary actions, such as "Since the box is already open,
there is no need to close it after placing the watches inside, ensuring the task is completed efficiently."

2. State Changes: Understanding how one’s actions will affect the form and conditions of elements in
a scene is crucial for decision-making [4]. The VLM is prompted to identify and predict state changes
that occur during the demonstration. For instance, an annotation might note the bowl becoming clean,
clearly indicating an expected state transition.

3. Task Decomposition and Subgoals: Breaking down a complex task into intermediate steps and
subgoals is crucial for managing extended and variable sequences of lower-level actions. These
temporal abstractions are important for human reasoning [6] and have been shown to improve LLM
outputs [81]. We prompt the VLM to add 1) a step-by-step plan detailing the demonstration, and 2) a
natural language summary of the actions.

4. State Abstraction: Useful representations do not simply mirror every aspect of the world; instead,
they selectively capture a manageable subset of details relevant to a specific purpose [31]. We focus
on identifying and including only those state variables that are relevant to the task at hand. This is
achieved by (1) selecting parts of the state that were directly interacted with by the agent during
the demonstration, and (2) prompting the VLM to suggest additional state variables not explicitly
included in the demonstrations but potentially relevant to understanding the task.

3.3
Abstraction Verification with a Human-in-the-loop

In this phase, ICAL verifies the generated abstractions with a human-in-the-loop. This involves
executing the optimized trajectory, ξoptimized within the actual task environment, under the watchful
guidance of a live human observer. The procedure is:

1. Execution of optimized trajectory: The agent attempts to perform the task by following the
optimized sequence of actions ξoptimized from the abstraction phase.

2. Monitoring and Intervention: As the agent executes ξoptimized, a human observer monitors the
process. If an action at fails, denoted by F(at) = 1, the observer intervenes by providing natural
language feedback H(at, ot). This feedback is context-specific, addressing the observed failure
directly (e.g., explaining that the Toaster is currently full and can only toast one slice of bread). We
provide additional details on the human-in-the-loop in the Appendix Section S5.1.3.

3. Feedback Integration and Trajectory Revision: Upon receiving feedback H(at, ot), the VLM
is provided with this input alongside the current state of ξoptimized and any existing language
annotations L. The VLM is prompted to revise ξoptimized to address the failure, to update existing
annotations L based on the feedback, and to add new annotations that capture insights from the
feedback.

This process can be represented by an update function:

Ξupdate(ξoptimized, H(at, ot), L, I, {e1, ..., ek}) →ξ′
optimized, L′
(3)

where Ξupdate denotes the update function that takes the current trajectory ξoptimized, human feed-
back H(at, ot), and current annotations L, and outputs the revised trajectory ξ′
optimized and updated
annotations L′. For the complete prompts, please refer to the Appendix.

4. Environment Reset and Retrial: Following a failure and subsequent feedback, the environment
is reset to a suitable state for retrying the task. The agent then attempts the task again, utilizing the
newly revised trajectory ξ′
optimized.

5. Success Criteria and Feedback Limit: This interactive phase continues until the human observer
deems the task execution successful, or until a predefined maximum number of feedback iterations,
Nfeedbacks, has been reached.

6. Saving example: If successful, we store the revised trajectory ξoptimized and language annotations
L to the memory set M. If unsuccessful after Nfeedbacks iterations, we do not store the example and
move to the next demonstration. We experiment with relabeling partially successful demonstrations
in Section S4.5 of the appendix.

Retrieval Augmented Generation at Deployment

Figure 3:
After the ICAL examples have
been learned, ICAL is deployed for new tasks
and environments using retrieval-augmented
generation.

Given the learned example set M and a new instruc-
tion I, we prompt the VLM to carry out the instruc-
tion by producing action sequences {a0, ..., aT } ∈A
from an action API that describes the skills set A
(e.g., go_to(X), pickup(X)), by retrieving the top
K examples from M to include in the prompt based
on their textual and visual similarity with the current
scene. The aggregated similarity score s for each
example e reads:

s = λI · sI + λtextual · stextual + λvisual · svisual,
(4)

where sI, stextual, and svisual are the similarity scores
for the input text instruction, textual state, and visual
state, respectively, computed via cosine similarity
using embeddings from OpenAI’s text-embedding-
ada-002 model and CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The coefficients λI, λtextual, and λvisual are weighting
hyperparameters chosen in each domain by a held out validation set.

The VLM prompt contains the new instruction I, the current webpage image for web agents or 12
video frames for ego4D annotated with set-of-marks [84], a textual state description xt describing

the objects and their attributes for embodied agents and HTML elements for web agents, the action
API A, and the retrieved set of in-context examples e1, ..., ek ∈M. An illustration of this process is
shown in Figure 3. The deployment prompt is provided in the Appendix.

Implementation details We use GPT-4-1106-preview [1] for text generation,
unless
otherwise stated,
and text-embedding-ada-002 [29] for text embeddings.
We use
gpt-4-1106-vision-preview [1] for the text and image generation model. We use k = 5 for
example retrieval. We use a temperature of 0 for TEACh and Ego4D, and 0.2 for VisualWebArena.

Experiments

We test ICAL for task planning in TEACh [63] and VisualWebArena [37] and for action forecasting
in Ego4D [28] benchmarks.

4.1
Environments

TEACh [63] The TEACh dataset comprises over 3,000 dialogue-based instructions for household
tasks in AI2-THOR [40]. We use the Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD) tasks where agents convert
dialogue instructions into action sequences, such as MAKE COFFEE. It includes training and
validation splits (seen and unseen), the latter featuring new environments and instructions. Agents
receive egocentric image inputs ot and perform actions like pickup(X) and turn_left(). Task
success is contingent on fulfilling all instruction conditions. Utilizing HELPER’s [68] perception,
navigation, and manipulation modules, the system relies on RGB images, depth maps, object masks,
and egomotion for 3D mapping and object recognition. We remove domain-specific checks from
HELPER’s modules to allow ICAL to learn them independently. Noisy Trajectories. We use
250 noisy trajectories from TEACh, omitting action labels but retaining language instructions and
corresponding RGB videos. To label actions from RGB video, we trained an inverse dynamics model
using a transformer encoder-decoder based on the DETR architecture [7] from a seperate 300 TEACh
episodes. Model predictions and human errors, like unnecessary movements, cause action noise in
these demonstrations. 122 examples were successfully abstracted by ICAL.

VisualWebArena [37] VisualWebArena consists of 910 episodes across various web tasks (Classi-
fieds, Shopping, Reddit) requiring visual comprehension and reasoning. Instructions may include
text and reference images, like adding an item seen in an image to a wish list. Agents operate with
instructions I, current webpage images, and an API for actions like click(X), executing tasks to
fulfill instruction conditions. Noisy Trajectories. From VisualWebArena, 30 human demonstrations
and 62 model trajectories from few-shot GPT4V were abstracted using ICAL. The process led to an
example set of 92 for evaluation.

Ego4D [28] This task involves anticipating actions from Ego4D RGB egocentric videos in daily
scenarios. Models select from 115 verbs and 478 nouns for predicting actions. We evaluate using
200 unseen videos from ego4D validation, applying edit distance as a performance metric. Input to
models includes sequences of video frames annotated with set-of-marks [84] tracking [12] and label
masks. The supervised baseline [28] (243 video hrs of Ego4D V2) uses a SlowFast backbone with a
Transformer aggregator. Noisy Trajectories. Due to the passive nature of this task, ICAL proceeds
without human-in-the-loop verification during ICAL (only Section 3.2, VLM-driven Abstraction
Generation). ICAL successfully abstracted 92/100 demonstrations taken from the Ego4D validation
set (8 failed due to GPT filters) for evaluation.

4.2
ICAL beats written & unchanged demonstrations in household instruction following

Table 1 presents our findings on the TEACh unseen validation set, assessing performance on new
instructions, houses, and objects. ICAL and baselines use HELPER’s navigation and manipulation
modules [68]. We compare with these baselines: 1. Hand-written examples from HELPER, the
SOTA on the TEACh benchmark, with 19 expert-written examples for retrieval-augmented prompting.
2. Zero-shot chain of thought, prompting the LLM to output step-by-step. 3. Raw Visual Demos,
retrieving unchanged demonstrations labeled with the inverse dynamics model. 4. Raw Kinesthetic
Demos, retrieving unchanged demonstrations with true actions. Our metrics are: 1. Task success
rate (SR), the % of tasks completed successfully. 2. Goal condition success rate (GC), the % partial
fulfillment rate across sessions.

---Page Break---
As shown in Figure 4, ICAL revises noisy trajectories, enabling more successful tasks completed
on training tasks than mimicking raw trajectories, with increases of 42 and 86 successful tasks for
kinesthetic and visual demonstrations, respectively. This shows how ICAL not only adds useful
abstractions but also corrects errors in the passive video demos, improving success in the original
demo environment. Please see the Appendix Section S4.3 for additional analysis.

Figure 4: ICAL enables greater success on
training tasks. Tasks successfully completed
by ICAL over number of interactions when
using the ICAL method with kinesthetic or vi-
sual demonstrations, and when replaying the
kinesthetic or visual demonstrations directly.

As shown in Table 1, on unseen tasks, ICAL out-
performs unprocessed demonstrations as in-context
examples, achieving a 17.9% absolute improvement
in SR over raw demos with predicted actions and
8.6% over those annotated with true actions. This
underscores the effectiveness of our abstractions in
improving the quality of examples for improved in-
context learning, unlike previous works that primarily
save and retrieve successful action plans or trajecto-
ries without abstractions [68, 76, 44].

Additionally, we surpass the handwritten examples
of the previous SOTA HELPER [68] by 12.6% in GC
and 0.6% in SR, and by 2.2% (relative 26.5%) using
estimated perception , demonstrating our method’s
efficacy with less expert intervention, leveraging
only visual demos and non-expert feedback. Unlike
HELPER, which requires domain experts to write
48-107 lines of text for each example, ICAL does not
rely on such extensive input from experts. Instead, it
allows non-experts to provide up to five natural lan-
guage feedback corrections to the agent, significantly
reducing the required effort and expertise per example.

ICAL obtains state-of-the-art performance on visual web tasks

We evaluate our agent with learned ICAL examples on the VisualWebArena evaluation set. We
partition this into episodes ‘seen’ by our model during learning, and those ‘unseen’ during learning.

Table 2 presents the results on VisualWebArena. Our model, ICAL, outperforms the previous state-
of-the-art [37], which uses GPT4V with few-shot, hand-designed examples and set-of-marks image
prompting [84]. ICAL achieves an absolute 8.4% (relative 58.7%) improvement in average success
rate over GPT4V and shows a 23.8% relative improvement in average success rate over GPT4o.

4.4
ICAL outperforms few-shot VLMs on egocentric video action forecasting

We test ICAL on video action forecasting without using human-in-the-loop abstraction verification
due to the passive nature of the task. As shown in Table 3, ICAL demonstrates superior few-shot
performance on Ego4D action anticipation compared to hand-written few-shot GPT4V that uses
chain of thought [81], improving by 6.4 noun and 1.7 action edit distance. ICAL also remains
competitive with the fully supervised baseline [28] in noun and action prediction despite using 639x
less in-domain training data. We find GPT4V video processing to have the least improvements for
verb action prediction, possibly due to its limited video understanding capabilities.

4.5
ICAL shows continual improvement with more examples

ICAL shows continual improvements in TEACh validation unseen success rate with more examples
learned, as shown in Figure 5. This is in contrast to the unchanged visual demos used for seeding
ICAL learning, which show only marginal improvements. Importantly, throughout learning, ICAL
does not need to worry about forgetting previously learned knowledge since the agent is expanding a
memory of examples and testing with a frozen VLM via in-context learning. Also noteworthy, our
method benefits from even a small amount of examples learned, with an improvement of an absolute
14.7% success rate over zero-shot chain-of-thought [39] prompting and 6.8% over the unchanged
demonstrations (with 10x less data) with just 10 abstracted demonstrations, showing the efficiency of
our method.

Efficient learning systems benefit greatly
from leveraging past knowledge, allowing
them to reduce the need for human inter-
vention and environment interactions as
they continue to process new data. Our
agent becomes increasingly efficient over
time, requiring less human feedback and
fewer environment interactions as it pro-
cesses more examples. By retrieving past
successful abstractions during the VLM-
abstraction making and human-in-the-loop
phases, it uses previously stored knowledge
to help abstract new examples. As shown
in Figure 6, for the second half of exam-
ples processed, the model requires signifi-
cantly fewer environment steps (436±88 vs.
267±43, p=0.0143) and human feedbacks
(0.74±0.17 vs. 0.21±0.08, p=0.0089) per
example. This demonstrates that retriev-
ing abstracted examples during abstraction
learning reduces both human effort and environment interaction over time. Consequently, using
previously stored ICAL examples not only improves test performance but also accelerates learning
for future examples.

Fine-tuning helps

Figure 6: ICAL improves learning effi-
ciency as more examples are added to mem-
ory. First half (blue) versus second half (orange)
of ICAL learning across tasks (left) and for each
task type separately (right) in TEACh. The second
half of ICAL learning requires significantly fewer
environment steps (436±88 vs. 267±43, p=0.0143)
and human feedbacks per episode (0.74±0.17 vs.
0.21±0.08, p=0.0089). This indicates that retriev-
ing ICAL examples during learning is beneficial,
reducing both human effort and environment inter-
action over time.

We finetune the GPT3.5-turbo-1106 model on the
learned ICAL examples in TEACh using LoRA [32]
in the AzureAI interface (see the Appendix Sec-
tion S5.4 for details).
The training data include
the 122 successfully abstracted examples by ICAL,
which we randomly split into 99 training samples and
23 validation samples. This leads to an improvement
of 11.4% task success and 15.7% goal-condition suc-
cess for the GPT3.5 model. Combining the finetuned
model with retrieval-augmented generation using the
ICAL examples led to an additional improvement of
0.7% task success and 4.9% goal-condition success
over using retrieval-augmented generation without
finetuning: our top-performing agent. This demon-
strates that consolidating the ICAL learned abstrac-
tions with weight fine-tuning helps performance.

4.8
Ablations
show each component of ICAL is important

We ablate the components of ICAL in TEACh in
Table 1. We conclude:

1. The abstraction phase significantly helps for refin-
ing the trajectories and adding generalizable knowl-
edge. We observe a decrease in 5.7% success rate and
4.4% in goal condition success rate when removing
the abstraction phase.
2. The human-in-the-loop phase is important for
fixing errors and incorporating feedback from the
user. We observe a decrease in 5.2% success rate and
8.3% in goal condition success rate when removing
the human-in-the-loop phase.
3. Our examples demonstrate scalability with larger
LLMs. GPT-4 showed a 6.6% absolute increase in
task success and a 14.3% absolute rise in goal condition success compared to GPT-3.5.
4. ICAL can be combined with advanced prompting and sampling methods. We test this using
re-ranking [78], where the model generates three diverse outputs from different retrieved examples
(e.g., top 1-5, 6-10, ...), self-evaluates, and selects the highest scoring output. Improvements are
modest but notable: 0.2% in task success and 2.5% in goal condition success.

5
Conclusion

We presented ICAL, a method that improves in-context learning by learning to abstract noisy demon-
strations into actionable insightful plans, that when used as in-context examples improve performance
of VLM agents over in-context learning from raw examples. ICAL proposes abstracting in-context
examples as a general form of quick learning from a handful of demonstrations and human-feedback.
It also reduces the need for expert examples, and enables more efficient learning. Tested in TEACh,
VisualWebArena, and Ego4D, ICAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating adaptabil-
ity to new tasks and environments. There are several limitations and future research directions for
ICAL. While ICAL can handle noisy demos, ICAL may not be able to handle extremely misleading
demonstrations or feedback, and relies on a fixed action API which may restrict adaptability in
dynamic environments. Additionally, GPT4V’s visual grounding deficiencies [90, 82, 55, 9] cannot
always be overcome by in-context learning, and more research is needed to address this.

Overview

The structure of this Appendix is as follows:

• Section S2 contains negative potential impacts.
• Section S4 contains additional experiments.
• Section S5 contains additional methods details.
• Section S6 contains additional details on the evaluation environments.

S2
Potential Negative Impact

The work introduced by ICAL for AI agents carries potential risks including the perpetuation of
biases, privacy infringement, user dependency, economic displacement, security vulnerabilities, and
the emergence of unintended behaviors due to technical limitations. Mitigating these risks necessitates
the development of mechanisms for bias correction, privacy preservation, ethical guidelines, and
security protocols. Engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders is imperative to ensure that the
deployment of these technologies aligns with societal values and contributes positively to the realm
of human-AI collaboration, fostering advancements that are both innovative and responsible.

ICAL relation to dAgger

S3.0.1
Relation of Abstraction Verification to DAgger

The human-in-the-loop phase of ICAL bears a conceptual resemblance to the Dataset Aggregation
(DAgger) algorithm [67], as both methods involve iterative refinement of an agent’s policy through
interaction with expert feedback. However, ICAL extends this framework by incorporating natu-
ral language feedback, updating both actions and abstractions, and utilizing retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with an explicit memory of optimized examples for policy improvement.

In DAgger, the agent collects data by executing its current policy and then queries an expert to obtain
the correct action for each encountered state. Specifically, at iteration t, the agent observes a state st
and takes an action at = πt(st) according to its policy πt. The expert provides the optimal action a∗
t ,
and the agent aggregates this data into a dataset D:

D = D ∪{(st, a∗
t )}.
(5)

The policy is then updated by minimizing a loss function over D:

πt+1 = arg min
π

X

(si,a∗
i )∈D
L(π(si), a∗
i ).
(6)

Similarly, in ICAL’s human-in-the-loop phase Fhitl, the agent refines its behavior based on human
feedback. When the agent executes an optimized trajectory ξoptimized and encounters a failure at action
at, a human observer provides natural language feedback H(at, ot) concerning the action at and the
observation ot. The agent integrates this feedback to update both the trajectory and the associated
language abstractions:

(ξ′
optimized, L′) = Ξupdate(ξoptimized, H(at, ot), L, I, {e1, . . . , ek}),
(7)

where L represents the current language annotations, I is the task instruction, and {e1, . . . , ek} are
retrieved examples from memory. This updated trajectory ξ′
optimized and abstractions L′ are then added
to an explicit memory E, enhancing the agent’s policy through enriched context:

E = E ∪{(ξ′
optimized, L′)}.
(8)

The agent’s policy πICAL is implicitly updated by conditioning on this memory during action genera-
tion:
πICAL(st, E) = VLM(st, E),
(9)
where VLM denotes the Vision-Language Model used for in-context learning.

---Page Break---
The similarities between ICAL and DAgger lie in their iterative approach to policy refinement using
expert feedback. However, ICAL offers several key benefits:

Natural Language Feedback: Unlike DAgger, which requires the expert to provide explicit action
corrections a∗
t , ICAL accepts natural language feedback H(at, ot). This allows the human to convey
richer information, including explanations, suggestions, and contextual details that can address not
only the immediate failure but also underlying misconceptions.

Revision of Actions and Abstractions: ICAL updates both the action sequence and the associated
language abstractions L. By refining the abstractions, the agent enhances its understanding of task
structures, causal relationships, and state changes, which promotes better generalization to new tasks
and environments.

Policy Improvement via Retrieval-Augmented Generation: ICAL maintains an explicit memory
E of optimized examples and abstractions. During deployment, the agent retrieves relevant examples
from E based on similarity measures and uses them as context for action generation. This retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG) approach allows the agent to leverage past experiences effectively,
adapting its policy without explicit parameter updates.

In contrast, DAgger relies solely on aggregating state-action pairs and updating the policy through
supervised learning, which may not capture higher-level task structures or facilitate transfer to
new domains. ICAL’s ability to process natural language feedback and to update both actions and
abstractions provides a more flexible and powerful framework for policy refinement, aligning more
closely with human learning processes. ICAL extends the traditional imitation learning paradigm
represented by DAgger, enabling more efficient and generalizable learning from human feedback.

Additional Experiments

S4.1
Learning efficiency broken down by task type

In Section 4.6 of the main paper, we showed how ICAL enables fewer environment interactions and
human feedbacks per example. We provide the learning efficiency between the first and second half
of demonstrations processed broken down by task type in Figure S1.

Figure S1: First half (blue) versus second half (orange) of ICAL learning across tasks (left) and for each task
type separately (right) in TEACh.

S4.2
Experimenting with different types of in-context examples in VisualWebArena

We experiment with an alternate way to provide the ICAL in-context examples to the VLM. Instead
of retrieving a single time step, we give the full trajectory of observations, abstractions, and actions
in textual format (no images provided). We run this on a reduced subset of 239 VisualWebArena

tasks. The results are presented in Table S1. We find that providing the full trajectory increases seen
success rate, but does not improve unseen success rate. In our final evaluation, we utilize the retrieval
of a single time step with image input, since expanding the context length through the full trajectory
adds to the cost without significantly improving the success rate on unseen tasks.

S4.3
TEACh results on ICAL learning using trajectories with ground truth action labels and
GPT3.5

We present tasks successfully completed for each task type in Table S2, comparing ICAL that uses
visual demonstrations and kinesthetic demonstrations.

We see that using GPT3.5 for ICAL significantly reduces the number of successful tasks by over half
compared to using GPT4 (52 versus 122 tasks successfully completed). We show in Section S4.5 of
the main paper how relabeling unsuccessful tasks can help improve performance when using weaker
models, such as GPT 3.5.

S4.4
TEACh validation accuracy by task type

We present ICAL agent performance after learning on the TEACh validation set for each task type in
Table S3.

S4.5
Relabeling unsuccessful examples improves ICAL when using weaker models

Instead of removing unsuccessful examples, we can instead relabel the examples by querying an LLM
to generate a new task instruction, step-by-step plan, and summary for the partial task completion.
In Table S4, we show performance of ICAL with and without relabeling. Relabeling improves
performance when using a weaker model, GPT3.5 during ICAL learning, by an absolute 3.4% in
success and 0.5% in GC.

Running ICAL from RGB-only input

We run ICAL from RGB inputs. We use the perception, navigation, and manipulation modules from
HELPER [68], which uses SOLQ [20] for object detection and ZeoDepth [5] for depth estimation.
HELPER initializes objects with default attributes based on the domain, and uses domain-specific pre-
condition checks and error correction. However, we wish to automate the learning of these modules,
and thus remove them. Additionally, HELPER initializes a memory of examples hand-written by a
domain expert. We replace these with our ICAL examples. For inferring attributes of the objects in
the abstracted state, we apply CogVLM [77], an open-source visual language model, on the detected
object crops, which we found to work best compared to other models for object attribute detection on
a separate dataset of cropped object images (see Appendix).

As shown in Table S5, we find that our ICAL agent obtains performance close to that of HELPER,
lagging behind 1.7% success and 3.2% goal condition success, despite not hand-designing object
attributes, pre-condition checks, error correction, and in-context examples. Additionally, when using
the hand-written HELPER examples with the ICAL execution modules, we find that the ICAL
examples outperform the HELPER examples by 2.2% in task success and by 1.3% in goal-condition
success, despite the ICAL examples being obtained without hand-writing from a domain-expert.
Additionally, when using the perception of ODIN [33], which utilizes multi-view images and a 3D
bottleneck for semantic segmentation, ICAL obtains performance on-par with that of HELPER.

S4.7
Benchmarking open-source VLMs for attribute detection in TEACh

In household instruction following, ICAL benefits from accurate object and attribute detection from
sensory input for state inference. For benchmarking object attribute detection in TEACh, we build a
dataset of 2581 object crops of clean viewpoints of the object by having the agent pick up the object
and centering the object in view. We build a second dataset of 661 from random viewpoints of the
object in the TEACh training set with different objects varying in their "dirty" and "cooked" attributes.
Clean viewpoints are always centered, unoccluded, and posed, while the random viewpoints are often
occluded and show the object from different angles. Example crops for the datasets for a ’dirty plate’
is shown in Figure S2. We test the following models: OPENCLIP CLIP-VIT-BIGG-14-LAION2B-
39B-B160K[13], OpenAI CLIP clip-vit-base-patch32[65], X-VLM[87], Llava 1.5[48], cogVLM[77],

Additional Methods Details

S5.1
In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL) Algorithm

We present the method for In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL) for a single trajectory in Algo-
rithm S1. Given a noisy trajectory, the method proceeds by first abstracting the trajectory through a
function Fabstract, which leverages a LLM or VLM to correct errors or inefficiencies in the trajectory
and generates language abstractions that capture the essence of the task, including subgoals, causal
relationships, and state changes. This phase does not require interaction with the environment or
humans.

Initialization sets up for the Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) phase by resetting the feedback count and
success flag. The method then enters a feedback loop where the optimized trajectory is executed
in the environment. If the task execution is successful, the loop breaks, and the method proceeds
to update the example set with the abstracted trajectory and its associated language abstractions.
Otherwise, human feedback is solicited at the point of failure to revise the trajectory and language

abstractions further, utilizing the VLM again. This feedback loop continues until either the task is
successfully executed or a predefined maximum number of feedback iterations is reached.

S5.1.1
Noisy Trajectories

We collect a noisy sequence of observations and actions, denoted as ξnoisy = o0, a0, . . . , oT , aT ,
which represents a trajectory for the language-defined task we aim for our agent to learn and adapt to.

The trajectory sequences can come from a variety of sources, including unlabeled video sequences.
We can also accommodate sub-optimal or unsuccessful attempts. In our work, we identify three
scenarios in which a given sequence, ξnoisy, might be inefficient or incorrect, and using them directly
as in-context examples for our LLM/VLM agents could result in poor performance:

• Human Non-experts: We gather demonstrations from humans without domain-specific
expertise. Specifically, these demonstrations o0, a0, . . . , oT , aT are collected from human
participants who are provided with a textual instruction I and an RGB image at each time
step, and are instructed to choose actions a ∈A to complete the instruction. These humans
commit errors, choose sub-optimal actions, and may not complete the task to its fullest
extent. For instance, an episode within TEACh [63] has a participant who picks up a knife
and then looks up and down before placing the knife down again, a sub-optimal action
sequence not required by the instruction [58].

• Visual Passive Demonstrations: Here, the agent is given a sequence of observations
ξ = {o0, o1, . . . , oT } that lack corresponding action labels. We collect these visual demon-
strations for TEACh only. We use the TEACh human demonstrations as described in the
previous text and take the egocentric RGB images without actions as the observation se-
quence. To infer the actions executed in these demonstrations, an inverse dynamics model is
applied to consecutive pair of frames Fidm(ot, ot+1), which predicts the action at respon-
sible for the state transition ot →ot+1. Along with sub-optimal human trajectories, the
inverse dynamics may make prediction errors. We trained a transformer encoder-decoder
model based on the DETR [7] architecture on 300 TEACh episodes (see Section S5.3 for
more details).

• Agent Trajectories: In Visual Web Arena [37], we obtain additional demonstrations
sourced from deploying our in-context VLM on new tasks. Specifically, we first run our
ICAL process on 30 human demonstrations collected by non-experts. We run the ICAL
process to abstract the 30 human demonstrations and then deploy our ICAL agent using the
learned examples as in-context examples. Using this ICAL agent, we collect an additional
62 new trajectories on Visual Web Arena tasks and continue to run the ICAL learning on
these new trajectories collected by the model.

S5.1.2
Abstraction phase implementation details

We present our prompt template for the VLM abstraction generation phase in Listing S5.

22


---Page Break---
TEACh.
We iterate through each Python program demonstration labeled with the inverse dynamics
model. Given the noisy Python program, instruction, action API, and object state, the abstraction
phase proceeds by prompting the LLM to 1) revise the the code for maximal efficiency and fix
mistakes in the code (abstracted trajectory), 2) provide a summary of the functionality of the script
(Task Decomposition & Subgoals), 3) provide a step-by-step plan of the steps of the script (Task
Decomposition & Subgoals), 4) Add object attribute state changes to the Python program (State
Changes), and 5) add abstraction comments (Task and Causal Abstractions). For state changes, we
parameterize the state changes in TEACh, allowing the LLM to add a change_state() function to
the actions to indicate a change in state of the objects the agent is interacting with. Each step uses
retrieved examples of successful examples previously saved in memory.

VisualWebArena.
We perform the abstraction phase for each individual action taken at (e.g.,
click(element), hover(element)) in each noisy trajectory ξnoisy obtained in VisualWebArena. Specifi-
cally, for each action in ξnoisy, we first prompt the VLM to optionally revise the action (optimized
trajectory), and output a summary and step-by-step reasoning for the chosen action (Task Decomposi-
tion & Subgoals), given the instruction, image observation, textual state description, previous actions
taken, and proposed trajectory action for the current time step. Next, we prompt the VLM to output
a a predicted next state (State Changes), given the instruction, current and next image observation,
current and next textual state, and the action taken at. We next prompt the VLM to output the
most relevant state elements for the task instruction (State Abstraction), given the instruction, image
observation, and textual state.

Finally, we prompt the VLM to output a set of abstraction comments, given the full sequence of
abstracted actions, task decomposition and subgoals, state changes, and abstracted state descriptions.

Ego4D.
We perform the abstraction phase for each full demonstration, consisting of 20 predicted
future times steps of actions. We give the VLM 3 video frames annotated with set-of-marks, the GT
actions, and the actions in the video, and prompt the VLM to annotate the four types of abstractions
for each example.

S5.1.3
Human-in-the-loop phase implementation details

We present our prompt template for the human-in-the-loop phase revisions in Listing S6.

TEACh.
The TEACh simulator enables fine-grained analysis of task progress. During the human-
in-the-loop phase, we formulate this task progress into natural language feedback for failed actions
(e.g., “The Toaster is full right now.” or missed task steps (e.g., “The Pillow needs to be put onto a
Sofa”). The natural language feedback, along with the instruction, object state, action API, and failed
actions/code, are given to the LLM to revise the program and abstractions.

VisualWebArena.
For 20 tasks for each website related to the tasks in the demonstrations collected,
we develop an interface to provide natural language corrections to the model based on the predicted
next action by the model. The humans are tasked to intervene and provide feedback when they deem
an action predicted by the model sub-optimal. When an action is proposed, the humans are given the
ability to accept the action or reject the action if it is sub-optimal. If sub-optimal, the humans can
type in natural language feedback which will be sent to the VLM to revise the action and abstractions.
We provide an example of the previous outputs, human feedback, and revised outputs in Listing S1.

Ego4D.
Due to the passive nature of the Ego4D task, where there is no agent executing the actions
predicted, no human in the loop phase is implemented. Ego4D only uses the abstraction phase.

S5.1.4
Relation of Abstraction Verification to DAgger

The human-in-the-loop phase of ICAL bears a conceptual resemblance to the Dataset Aggregation
(DAgger) algorithm [67], as both methods involve iterative refinement of an agent’s policy through
interaction with expert feedback. However, ICAL extends this framework by incorporating natu-
ral language feedback, updating both actions and abstractions, and utilizing retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with an explicit memory of optimized examples for policy improvement.

In DAgger, the agent collects data by executing its current policy and then queries an expert to obtain
the correct action for each encountered state. Specifically, at iteration t, the agent observes a state st
and takes an action at = πt(st) according to its policy πt. The expert provides the optimal action a∗
t ,
and the agent aggregates this data into a dataset D:
D = D ∪{(st, a∗
t )}.
(10)
The policy is then updated by minimizing a loss function over D:

πt+1 = arg min
π

X

(si,a∗
i )∈D
L(π(si), a∗
i ).
(11)

Similarly, in ICAL’s human-in-the-loop phase Fhitl, the agent refines its behavior based on human
feedback. When the agent executes an optimized trajectory ξoptimized and encounters a failure at action
at, a human observer provides natural language feedback H(at, ot) concerning the action at and the
observation ot. The agent integrates this feedback to update both the trajectory and the associated
language abstractions:

(ξ′
optimized, L′) = Ξupdate(ξoptimized, H(at, ot), L, I, {e1, . . . , ek}),
(12)

where L represents the current language annotations, I is the task instruction, and {e1, . . . , ek} are
retrieved examples from memory. This updated trajectory ξ′
optimized and abstractions L′ are then added
to an explicit memory E, enhancing the agent’s policy through enriched context:

E = E ∪{(ξ′
optimized, L′)}.
(13)

The agent’s policy πICAL is implicitly updated by conditioning on this memory during action genera-
tion:
πICAL(st, E) = VLM(st, E),
(14)

where VLM denotes the Vision-Language Model used for in-context learning.

The similarities between ICAL and DAgger lie in their iterative approach to policy refinement using
expert feedback. However, ICAL offers several key benefits:

Natural Language Feedback: Unlike DAgger, which requires the expert to provide explicit action
corrections a∗
t , ICAL accepts natural language feedback H(at, ot). This allows the human to convey
richer information, including explanations, suggestions, and contextual details that can address not
only the immediate failure but also underlying misconceptions.

Revision of Actions and Abstractions: ICAL updates both the action sequence and the associated
language abstractions L. By refining the abstractions, the agent enhances its understanding of task
structures, causal relationships, and state changes, which promotes better generalization to new tasks
and environments.

Policy Improvement via Retrieval-Augmented Generation: ICAL maintains an explicit memory
E of optimized examples and abstractions. During deployment, the agent retrieves relevant examples
from E based on similarity measures and uses them as context for action generation. This retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG) approach allows the agent to leverage past experiences effectively,
adapting its policy without explicit parameter updates.

In contrast, DAgger relies solely on aggregating state-action pairs and updating the policy through
supervised learning, which may not capture higher-level task structures or facilitate transfer to
new domains. ICAL’s ability to process natural language feedback and to update both actions and
abstractions provides a more flexible and powerful framework for policy refinement, aligning more
closely with human learning processes. ICAL extends the traditional imitation learning paradigm
represented by DAgger, enabling more efficient and generalizable learning from human feedback.

Inverse Dynamics Model

Backbone. Given an input image pair ximages ∈R2×3×H0×W0 (2 frames and 3 color channels), we
use a CNN to produce lower-resolution activation maps f ∈R2×C×H×W , where H0 and W0 denote
the original height and width, respectively, and H and W represent the dimensions of the resulting
feature map.

Transformer Encoder. The spatial features are input into a transformer encoder, where they undergo
self-attention. We reshape the spatial dimensions into a single dimension, resulting in a feature

map with dimensions d × HW. Each layer of the encoder consists of a multi-head self-attention
mechanism and a feed-forward network. Fixed spatial positional encodings and learned frame
encodings are added to the inputs at each attention layer. The transformer encoder comprises six
self-attention layers, utilizes eight heads, has an embedding size of 384, and contains six encoder
layers.

Transformer Decoder. The decoder incorporates cross-attention mechanisms for both object and
action queries with respect to the encoder features. It processes N queries simultaneously across
its layers. The embeddings, comprising action queries and object queries, add learned positional
encodings at the input of each attention layer. Each layer of the decoder includes cross-attention
from the queries to the encoder features, self-attention among the query features, and a feed-forward
network. The transformer decoder consists of six self-attention layers, employs eight heads, has an
embedding size of 384, and includes six encoder layers.

After the decoder, we use a feed-forward network to reduce each embedding from dimension d to a
scalar value. These scalar values for actions and objects are concatenated, creating final action logits
for each action and each object. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss for both actions and
objects, such as ’pickup’ and ’apple’. Additionally, we introduce an extra query for ’no object’ to
accommodate actions that do not involve manipulating an object (e.g., move_forward()).

Dataset. We use a random subset of 649 training episodes from the TEACh training dataset and 181
validation episodes from the TEACh validation seen dataset, which do not overlap with the episodes
used for the ICAL example learning. We use Each episode contains a trajectory of observations
and actions {o0, a0, . . . , oT , aT }. We use each pair of observations (ot, ot+1), and the action at
responsible for the state transition ot →ot+1, as training samples for the network.

Implementation details. We use a learning rate of 2e −5, batch size of 64, a step learning rate
scheduler with γ = 0.1 and step size = 30 epochs. We use early stopping based on validation loss
and train for 45 epochs. We use cross entropy loss with a manual class weight rescaling based on
frequencies in the training set. Training and model implementation is done in PyTorch.

Applying Inverse Dynamics Model on held-out demonstrations. On the held out 250 TEACh episodes
used for ICAL example learning, we feed each pair of observations to the trained inverse dynamics
model to predict actions. We convert the sequence of predicted actions into a Python program based
on the ICAL action API for TEACh. This involves converting each action into a Python function
and aggregating contiguous navigation actions (move_forward(), turn_left()) into a single go_to()
function in the program. An example of the predicted Python program is shown in Listing S2. We
also provide the fully revised program after running ICAL learning on the predicted program in
Listing S3.

LLM finetuning details

We use the examples obtained from the ICAL method applied in TEACh, a total of 122 examples.
We split the dataset randomly into 99 training samples and 23 validation samples. Input tokens for
training consist of each example (instruction, object state, and API) with the prompt template used
for zero-shot prompting. Output tokens consist of the Python program with abstraction comments for
each example The mean input token length per sample is 3145.17, while the mean output token length
per sample is 432.82. We use the Azure OpenAI Service for fine-tuning, which uses the next-token
prediction objective and LoRA [32] for parameter-efficient finetuning of gpt-35-turbo-1106.

Additional implementation details

S6.1
TEACh

The TEACh dataset builds on the Ai2thor simulation environment [40]. At each time step the agent
may choose from the following actions: Forward(), Backward(), Turn Left(), Turn Right(), Look Up(),
Look Down(), Strafe Left(), Strafe Right(), Pickup(X), Place(X), Open(X), Close(X), ToggleOn(X),
ToggleOff(X), Slice(X), and Pour(X), where X refers an object specified via a relative coordinate
(x, y) on the egocentric RGB frame. Navigation actions move the agent in discrete steps. We rotate in
the yaw direction by 90 degrees, and rotate in the pitch direction by 30 degrees. The RGB and depth
sensors are at a resolution of 480x480, a field of view of 90 degrees, and lie at a height of 0.9015
meters. The agent’s coordinates are parameterized by a single (x, y, z) coordinate triplet with x and
z corresponding to movement in the horizontal plane and y reserved for the vertical direction. The
TEACh benchmark allows a maximum of 1000 steps and 30 API failures per episode.

S6.1.1
Planning at test time

Given a new environment and instruction, ICAL first maps out the scene to build a navigation map
and detect objects and their attributes (see next sections). ICAL then retrieves the top-k examples
relevant to the instruction and object state (see Section 3.4). ICAL then obtains the abstracted object
state to give to the LLM (see Section S5.1.2). ICAL then prompts the LLM, given the instruction,
abstracted object state, and retrieved in-context examples, to output Python code to carry out the new
instruction in the environment. If code execution failures occur, we re-prompt the LLM with the
execution error and ask the LLM to revise the code.

S6.1.2
ICAL differences with HELPER

In TEACh, we build on HELPER [68] for program execution. Here, we give an account of HELPER.
HELPER prompts an LLM, namely GPT-4 [1], to generate plans as Python programs. It assumes that
the agent has access to a set of action skills S (e.g., go_to(X), pickup(X), etc.). We use a reduced
set of these skills (e.g., we remove the cook(), clean(), and toast() primitives as we wish for our
model to learn these). HELPER generates code that is decomposed into these action skills. Instead of

30


---Page Break---
demoposing them into action primitives, we run the Python code generated from the LLM directly
(i.e., using the ’exec’ function in Python). Each action skill comes with a set of pre-engineered
pre-condition checks, which we also remove. HELPER maintains a 3D semantic map for navigation
and keeping track of objects (see next sections).

S6.1.3
Obstacle map

ICAL maintains a 2D overhead occupancy map of its environment ∈RH×W that it updates at each
time step from the input RGB-D stream. The map is used for exploration and navigation in the
environment. At every time step t, we unproject the input depth maps using intrinsic and extrinsic
information of the camera to obtain a 3D occupancy map registered to the coordinate frame of the
agent, similar to earlier navigation agents [8]. The 2D overhead maps of obstacles and free space
are computed by projecting the 3D occupancy along the height direction at multiple height levels
and summing. For each input RGB image, we run a SOLQ object segmentor [20] (pretrained on
COCO [46] then finetuned on TEACh rooms) to localize each of 116 semantic object categories.
For failure detection, we use a simple matching approach from [57] to compare RGB pixel values
before and after taking an action. When using ground truth perception, we use ground truth semantic
segmentation, depth maps, object attributes, and action failure detection.

S6.1.4
Object location and state tracking

We maintain an object memory as a list of object detection 3D centroids and their predicted semantic
labels {[(X, Y, Z)i, ℓi ∈{1...N}], i = 1..K}, where K is the number of objects detected thus far.
The object centroids are expressed with respect to the coordinate system of the agent, and, similar to
the semantic maps, updated over time using egomotion. We track previously detected objects by their
3D centroid C ∈R3. We estimate the centroid by taking the 3D point corresponding to the median
depth within the segmentation mask and bring it to a common coordinate frame. We do a simple
form of non-maximum suppression on the object memory, by comparing the euclidean distance of
centroids in the memory to new detected centroids of the same category, and keep the one with the
highest score if they fall within a distance threshold.

For each object in the object memory, we maintain an object state dictionary with a pre-defined list of
attributes. These attributes include: category label, centroid location, holding, detection score, can
use, sliced, toasted, clean, cooked. For the attributes, these are initialized by sending the detected
object crops in the abstracted state, defined by the detector mask, to the VLM model, and asking it
"Is this {category} {word1} or {word2}? Provide only your answer, either "{word1}" or "{word2}",
and taking the answer as the output attribute.

S6.2
VisualWebArena

The VisualWebArena [37] builds on Web Arena [92] contains 910 evaluation instructions with three
interactive websites: Classifieds, Reddit, and Shopping. At each time step, the agent obtains a Set
of Marks annotated image and and the webpage content, in a textual format listing the button text
with their set of marks ID. The set of marks bounding boxes and textual state are extracted from the
HTML code for the current webpage. At each time step, the agent must select an action to carry out
the instruction. The instruction includes a natural language description and potentially one or more
reference images. The action space is as follows:

• click [elem] Click on element elem.

• hover [elem] Hover on element elem.

• type [elem] [text] Type text on element elem.

Additional details on ICAL agent deployment in VisualWebArena

At each time step, we retrieve the top-5 examples and prompt the model with the 5 in-context
examples. Each in-context example consists of the image input, abstracted textual state, summary,
step-by-step reasoning, predicted next state, abstraction comments, and predicted action. We use the
Set of Marks (SoM) [84] representation for image inputs, implemented in VisualWebArena by [37].

Ego4D

Ego4D is a daily life activity video dataset of hundreds of scenarios. We focus on the long-term action
anticipation task to predict the future user actions given an RGB egocentric video. Models must
choose from 115 verbs and a set of 478 nouns for action predictions. For evaluation, we take 100 seen
validation videos that come from the same videos used for ICAL example learning but at a different,
unseen location, and a separate 200 completely unseen validation videos for evaluation. We follow
previous work and use edit distance as a metric, which is computed as the Damerau-Levenshtein
distance over sequences of predictions of verbs, nouns and actions. The goal of this measure is to
assess performance in a way which is robust to some error in the predicted order of future actions. All
GPT4V evaluations give image inputs annotated with DEVA tracking masks [12] with Set-of-Marks
labels [84]. For in-context examples to GPT4V, we concatenate 3 uniformly spaced video frames and
give it as a single image input. For the input video to GPT4V, we take 12 video frames uniformly
spaced and provide 4 images each with 3 concatenated frames. The supervised baseline uses a
SlowFast backbone with a Transformer aggregator and trains on Ego4D V2 (243 video hrs) [28].

Noisy Trajectories

100 demonstrations from validation set were abstracted using ICAL. Due to the passive nature of this
task, we perform ICAL without the abstraction verification with a human-in-the-loop phase, and only
perform the VLM-driven Abstraction Generation (Section 3.2). 92 demonstrations (8 failed due to
GPT4V filters) were successfully abstracted by ICAL for an example set size of 92 for evaluation.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction outline the proposed method (ICAL), its objec-
tives, the types of abstractions it handles, and the benchmarks used for evaluation, all of
which are detailed further in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations in the conclusion and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

38


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide anonymized code and detail all implementation in our main paper
and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

39


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide a link to anonymized code which has README instructions for
running our models and experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all data splits and hyperparameters in the main paper and Appendix.
We additional provide all data splits in our code release.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Due to the deterministic nature of our models and existing resource constraints,
we do not to report error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

40


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide compute resources used for training and evaluation in the Ap-
pendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics guidelines, ensuring that our research
and practices meet the ethical standards set forth by NeurIPS.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we include a section on societal impacts of the work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

41


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will add a safeguard agreement to our github repository when the code is
publicly released.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We are the original creators of the assets used and give credit to previous work
when building upon others’ code or using external code or data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

42


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our accessible website (anonymized) offers easy access to our results and
code. Additionally, we provide anonymized code that is well-documented with README
files for setting up the models and environments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not use crowdsourcing or human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not use crowdsourcing or human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

43


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
