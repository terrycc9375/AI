Abstract

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a large-scale foundation model that has
revolutionized segmentation methodology. Despite its impressive generalization
ability, the segmentation accuracy of SAM on images with intricate structures is
often unsatisfactory. Recent works have proposed lightweight fine-tuning using
high-quality annotated data to improve accuracy on such images. However, here
we provide extensive empirical evidence that this strategy leads to forgetting how
to “segment anything”: these models lose the original generalization abilities of
SAM in the sense that they perform worse for segmentation tasks not represented
in the annotated fine-tuning set. To improve performance without forgetting, we
introduce a novel framework that combines high-quality annotated data with a
large unlabeled dataset. The framework relies on two methodological innova-
tions. First, we quantify the uncertainty in the SAM pseudo labels associated
with the unlabeled data and leverage it to perform uncertainty-aware fine-tuning.
Second, we encode the type of segmentation task associated with each training
example using a task prompt to reduce ambiguity. We evaluated the proposed
Segmentation with Uncertainty Model (SUM) on a diverse test set consisting of 14
public benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, our method
consistently surpasses SAM by 3-6 points in mean IoU and 4-7 in mean bound-
ary IoU across point-prompt interactive segmentation rounds. Code is available

Introduction

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) [1] is a ground-breaking vision foundation model to perform
interactive binary segmentation, where the goal is to identify the pixels belonging to a target region
in an input image. The task is interactive, because the model accepts prompts from the user, which
specify the desired target region. These prompts are typically in the form of a set of points that should
be included or excluded from the target region, or a box or mask that encompasses it.

SAM is trained via a boot-strapping training procedure called a data engine on massive dataset
of unlabeled images. The key idea is to leverage model-generated pseudo-labels to annotate the
unlabeled data and use the pseudo-labels to further train the model. SAM is notable for its impressive
general-purpose capabilities, allowing it to segment a wide range of objects, parts, and visual
structures. Yet, the model encounters difficulties in achieving high-quality segmentation of intricate
structures and often produces imprecise segmentation boundaries. This is problematic for applications
such as image editing and automatic image annotation [2, 3], where accurate fine-grained predictions
are essential.

Our analysis in Appendix I reveals that inaccuracies within pseudo-labels are substantial, especially
in boundary regions. It has been reported in [1] that simply scaling up the amount of pseudo-labeled
data by 10x only achieves marginal improvement (around 0.5 mIoU). To improve segmentation

Figure 1: SUM improves SAM without forgetting to “segment anything.” Performance compari-
son between the Segment Anything Model (SAM), HQ-SAM model fine-tuned on the HQ-Seg-44K
dataset, and the proposed Segment with Uncertainty Model (SUM) fine-tuned using a high-quality
annotated dataset and unlabeled data. Each row corresponds to held-out datasets focusing on different
segmentation tasks (SegTask). Left: Both HQ-SAM and SUM show qualitative improvements over
SAM, particularly in salient-object segmentation of complex structures (top row). HQ-SAM, however,
struggles with background entities (middle row) and part segmentation (bottom row), often erro-
neously prioritizing objects in the foreground or entire objects. Right: SUM consistently outperforms
SAM and HQ-SAM in quantitative comparisons, achieving the highest mean boundary IoU across
diverse evaluation sets and interactive segmentation rounds. We adhere to the same point prompt
sampling evaluation strategy as SAM [1] (Appendix B.3). More examples are in Appendix H.2, H.3.

quality, recent works [4, 5] suggest fine-tuning SAM exclusively with data paired with high-quality
human annotation. A key challenge is that the size of those datasets is usually relatively small,
and the diversity of images and annotations they contain is limited. Consequently, the model
may overfit the characteristics of the fine-tuning dataset, which degrades its performance in other
situations (e.g., segmentation tasks different from the fine-tuning dataset). Currently, the most
common strategy to mitigate this is lightweight finetuning, which only updates a small subset of
model parameters [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, our experiments find that the overfitting problem still
persists, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 and Section 4.2.

In this paper, our goal is to investigate how to better learn from pseudo-labels, with the help of
high-quality human-annotated data. We then apply these insights to improve the accuracy of
SAM without compromising its generalization. Our proposed framework, the Segmentation with
Uncertainty Model (SUM), performs fine-tuning in a manner that is aware of the regions where
model-generated pseudo-labels have questionable accuracy. This is achieved by explicitly estimating
pseudo-label uncertainty in the unlabeled training data, in the form of an uncertainty map generated
by a specialized module. The uncertainty map is then incorporated into a novel uncertainty-aware
training loss, which reduces the influence of pseudo-label regions that are expected to be inaccurate.
The framework has an additional advantage when training interactive-segmentation models. During
training, user prompts are typically generated randomly based on the available labels. Our framework
additionally enables uncertainty-aware prompt sampling, which avoids producing misleading prompt
locations.

Our framework also addresses an additional challenge in fine-tuning segmentation foundation models.
Human annotations usually correspond to specific segmentation tasks. For instance, the HQ-Seg-
44K [4] used by previous fine-tuning approaches [4] focuses on salient-object segmentation, where
the target regions may include multiple entities in a complex arrangement. In contrast, current
general-purpose interactive segmentation models, such as SAM, are mainly trained for entity or part
segmentation, where target regions are associated with individual entities or object parts, respectively.
To take this into account, we propose a novel task prompt, which informs the model of the desired

segmentation task during training. This resolves ambiguities between the human and model-generated
labels, and can also be leveraged to specify the desired segmentation task during inference.

To evaluate SUM, we performed systematic experiments with diverse segmentation datasets, resulting
in the following insights. (1) Existing fine-tuning approaches forget to segment anything. After
fine-tuning on HQ-Seg-44K, they outperform SAM on salient-object segmentation but underperform
on held-out datasets where annotations are associated with entities or object parts (Fig. 1 and Sec-
tion 4.2). (2) Including unlabeled data associated with SAM pseudo-labels in the fine-tuning dataset
prevents forgetting, but also yields a limited gain in performance if noise inherent in pseudo-labels
is not effectively managed (see Section 4.3). (3) SUM is able to effectively leverage the labeled
and unlabeled data to achieve superior performance (see Section 4.2 and Appendix G.1). This is
demonstrated in controlled experiments using publicly available fine-tuning datasets, as well as on
a large-scale internal dataset. An ablation study (see Section 4.3) shows that the different method-
ological innovations (uncertainty-based loss, uncertainty-based prompting, and task prompting) all
contribute to this gain in performance.

Related Work

Segmentation Foundation Models
Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, which
includes semantic segmentation [9, 10, 11, 12], instance segmentation [13, 14], panoptic segmenta-
tion [15, 16], and interactive segmentation [17, 18, 19, 20]. Inspired by the breakthroughs of language
foundation models [21, 22, 23, 24], the field has recently witnessed the emergence of large-scale
segmentation models pre-trained on massive datasets, which demonstrate remarkable generalization
capabilities. Painter [25] and SegGPT [26] proposed robust in-context learning frameworks enabling
segmentation of images given image-mask prompts. Recently, SEEM [27] introduced a multi-modal
reference-prompted general segmentation model. Our work builds on the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) [1], a ground-breaking foundational model for interactive segmentation. SAM is trained
leveraging a boot-strapping training procedure called a data engine, which encompasses multiple
phases with different degrees of human supervision, culminating in a fully-automated stage where
the pseudo-labels are generated automatically from the model.

Fine-tuning Segmentation Foundation Models
Different methods have been proposed to extend
SAM, and other foundation models, in different ways, such as increasing inference speed [28, 29],
performing all-purpose matching [30] or personalized segmentation [31], increasing granularity [32],
enabling language-informed segmentation guidance [33], and adapting to specific domains (e.g.,
medical imaging [34, 35, 6, 7, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], agriculture [8], remote sensing [42], shadow
detection [43, 44, 45], or water leakage [46]).

Our goal is to enhance SAM’s accuracy while maintaining its generalizability. HQ-SAM [4] pursues
a similar goal, but primarily focuses on minimal architectural adaptations for light-weight fine-tuning
on high-quality human-annotated data. Here, we focus on an effective framework for leveraging
limited human-annotated data and diverse unlabeled data.

Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation
Semi-supervised semantic segmentation [47, 48, 49, 50]
also aims to leverage unlabeled data when labeled data is limited. However, the purpose is usually to
enhance the performance of a model on a specific task. In this work, we aim to instead leverage the
unlabeled data to preserve the generalization ability of a foundation model for diverse segmentation
tasks (e.g. part, object, background), which may not be represented in the labeled data. The majority
of semi-supervised approaches enforce consistency between predictions corresponding to augmented
versions of an unlabeled image. This is achieved through various specialized architectures such
as teacher-student networks [51, 52, 53], parallel networks [54, 55], or incorporating additional
representation heads [56]. In contrast, our proposed method seeks to improve the pseudo-labels based
on the data engine of SAM, requiring minimal modifications to the existing architecture. Combining
these two types of approaches is an interesting direction for future investigation.

Uncertainty-aware Segmentation
Uncertainty-aware segmentation has been explored for semi-
supervised settings (e.g. U2PL [51]), and domain-adaptive segmentation [57, 58, 59]. These methods
typically employ prediction confidence [51, 57] or discrepancy among multiple prediction heads [59,
58] to quantify uncertainty. Our approach differs fundamentally from previous approaches in both

the generation of uncertainty maps and the utilization of uncertainty maps. SAM undergoes multiple
rounds of self-training, which leads to the accumulation and overfitting of errors in pseudo-labels [60].
During our evaluation, the model frequently predicts incorrect regions with high confidence, and
different heads agree on these erroneous areas. Experiments detailed in Section 4.2 show that previous
approaches are ineffective in our context. Our main insight is to use external supervision to identify
and correct systematic biases that accumulate during training. Further discussion can be found in
Appendix E.2.

Method

3.1
Preliminary Background: Segment Anything Model (SAM)

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) [1] consists of three modules: an image encoder based on
a large vision transformer, a lightweight prompt encoder for geometric inputs (e.g., points, boxes,
mask indicating the target in interactive segmentation), and a lightweight mask decoder. The decoder
combines the outputs of both encoders to produce a predicted segmentation mask.

During training, the model is provided interactive prompts iteratively. The first prompt is obtained by
randomly selecting a point or bounding box from the target mask. Then, subsequent point prompts
are randomly sampled within the error region, which is the discrepancies between the target mask
and prior model prediction. At each training step, the model receives the preceding mask prediction
as an additional input.

3.2
Segment with Uncertainty Model (SUM)

The Segment with Uncertainty Model (SUM) is a fine-tuning framework to improve the segmentation
quality of an existing foundational segmentation model, which builds upon the Segment Anything
Model (SAM). A diagram illustrating the framework is provided in Fig. 2. The framework assumes
the availability of a human-labeled set with high-quality labels (e.g. HQ-Seg-44K), and a large,
diverse unlabeled set (e.g. SA-1B [1]). These datasets are used to fine-tune SAM via interactive
segmentation training. Training is performed with human annotations for the labeled data and with
SAM-generated pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. These pseudo-labels are produced in accordance
with SAM’s automatic mask generation pipeline (for more details, see Appendix B).

SUM contains several novel elements designed to improve the fine-tuning process. The pseudo-
labels generated by SAM are inaccurate, which is problematic for training. SUM addresses this
by exploiting the insight that this inaccuracy is systematic and predictable. Uncertainty maps are
leveraged to modify the fine-tuning cost function and the generation of training prompts for the
unlabeled examples to make them uncertainty aware, as explained in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. The
uncertainty maps are produced by an uncertainty-quantification module described in Section 3.2.3.
Additionally, SUM incorporates a task prompt, described in Section 3.2.4, which allows us to specify
the desired segmentation task.

3.2.1
Uncertainty-aware Loss

SUM combines human-annotated and unlabeled data, utilizing different training losses for each. For
the human-annotated data, SUM minimizes the same training loss as SAM: a linear combination of
focal loss [61] and Dice loss [62]. For the unlabeled data, we propose to utilize uncertainty-aware
versions of both losses instead, which are then combined in the same way as SAM. The goal is
to down-weight the influence of uncertain areas in the pseudo-labels and increase the influence of
regions with high confidence.

The uncertainty-aware focal loss lUAfocal is obtained by incorporating pixel-specific weights to the
standard focal loss [61]. Let ˆyi denote the binary pseudo-label corresponding to the ith pixel in an
input image, pi the corresponding probability predicted by the model, and ui the corresponding entry
of the uncertainty map obtained from the SUM uncertainty-quantification module (see Section 3.2.3).
The uncertainty is between 0 (highly certain) and 1 (highly uncertain). The contribution of each pixel
to the focal loss lfocal(pi, ˆyi) is weighted by ci = 1 −ui, which can be interpreted as the certainty

Figure 2: Segment with Uncertainty Model (SUM) framework. The diagram describes the
proposed SUM framework, which utilizes both human-annotated and unlabeled data to fine-tune a
foundation model for interactive segmentation. Top: When processing human-annotated examples,
interactive prompts are sampled based on the binary-mask labels and fed iteratively into the model
along with the image. Since this binary mask depends on the type of segmentation task desired
by the user, SUM incorporates a task prompt that specifies the task relevant to each annotation
(1 for salient-object segmentation and 2 for entity segmentation). Bottom: For unlabeled images,
the iterative prompts are sampled based on model-generated binary pseudo-labels, which may be
inaccurate. SUM includes an uncertainty-quantification module that processes the pseudo-labels,
generating an uncertainty map. This map is leveraged within an uncertainty-aware loss function used
for training, and also informs how the interactive prompts are sampled. For all unlabeled data, the
task prompt is set to 0. Components highlighted in red represent our novel contributions, whereas the
remaining components adhere to the SAM framework.

3.2.2
Uncertainty-aware Prompt Sampling

SUM applies the same prompt-sampling strategy as SAM for the human-annotated data during
interactive training. The first prompt is obtained by selecting a point or bounding box at random from
the target mask containing the positive segmentation labels. Then, subsequent positive point prompts

5


---Page Break---
are selected from regions in the target mask not present in the predicted mask, and negative point
prompts are selected from regions in the predicted mask not present in the target mask. When the target
mask is inaccurate, which is often the case when it relies on pseudo-labels, this is problematic because
the point prompts may be completely incorrect. To address this, SUM leverages the uncertainty maps
generated by the uncertainty-quantification module (see Section 3.2.3) to perform uncertainty-aware
prompt sampling. Let R denote the region used by SAM for prompt sampling.1 Uncertainty-aware
sampling selects each pixel i in R with probability Pi = ci/ Pn
j=1 cj, where ci is defined above as
the certainty associated with the pixel. This strategy ensures that prompts are sampled mostly from
regions with high confidence.

3.2.3
Generation of Uncertainty Maps

In this section, we describe how uncertainty quantification is performed within the SUM framework,
detailing the generation of uncertainty maps associated with pseudo-labels. For this purpose, SUM
uses a specialized mask-refinement module. The module receives the logits produced by the SAM
model2 as an input and outputs a refined prediction of the segmentation mask. The uncertainty
map is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the refined prediction and the sigmoid-
transformed probabilities of the SAM logits. The uncertainty value for the i-th pixel in the uncertainty
map ui is given by:

u = |σ(si) −σ(ri)|
(3)

where σ is the sigmoid function, si denotes the SAM logits for the i-th pixel, and ri denotes the
refined prediction for the i-th pixel. This yields values between 0 (no difference, indicating low
uncertainty) and 1 (large difference, indicating high uncertainty). This is illustrated in Fig. 3. The
mask-refinement module also receives as input a box prompt encompassing the pseudo-label and the
point prompt used to generate the pseudo-labels.

(3) The uncertainty map equals the absolute difference between the SAM and refined predictions.
Additional visual examples of the uncertainty map are presented in Appendix Fig. 10.

The mask-refinement module is implemented by fine-tuning SAM’s decoder and prompt encoder.
To be clear, these fine-tuned components are exclusively used to generate uncertainty maps before
training SUM. We train the mask-refinement module to refine the SAM pseudo-label masks using
the corresponding high-quality labels in the high-quality human-annotated dataset. During training,
we feed the SAM pseudo-label logits to the mask-refinement module in the same way that SAM
incorporates previous mask predictions in its interactive segmentation training protocol.

Appendix D provides an in-depth description of the design of the mask-refinement module, including
quantitative and human-subject evaluations of the resulting segmentation maps, the relationship
between uncertainty and pseudo-label accuracy, alongside a comparative analysis of model variants.

Although it is possible to replace SAM pseudo-labels with refined masks in a naive manner, we
empirically find that it less effective than uncertainty-aware training, as reported in Table 2. This
suggests that potential errors in mask refinement (see Appendix Fig. 9) may impact performance.

region in the predicted mask not present in the target mask are taken as negative prompts.

3.2.4
Task Prompt

Segmentation datasets often focus on different segmentations tasks, resulting in dramatic and system-
atic differences between their labels. For example, the HQ-Seg-44K [4] dataset targets salient-object
segmentation, where a segmentation mask may include multiple entities in a complex arrangement.
In contrast, the pseudo-labels produced by SAM for the SA-1B dataset mostly correspond to entity
segmentation (where masks are associated with individual entities) or part segmentation (where
masks indicate parts of objects). This is problematic for joint training, as it introduces a high degree
of ambiguity regarding the segmentation mask that the model should predict after the initial prompt.

To resolve this ambiguity, SUM includes a task prompt to accompany the first point or box prompt,
indicating the segmentation task associated with each training example. In practice, we identify the
task based on the dataset associated with each example. We assign 0 to examples from the unlabeled
dataset, 1 to examples from human-annotated datasets focused on salient-object segmentation, and 2
to examples from human-annotated datasets focused on entity segmentation. See Appendix H.1 for
an illustration. More categories can be added to account for additional segmentation tasks (e.g., 3 for
part segmentation). The task prompt is implemented via an embedding layer, which acts as a lookup
table mapping each discrete task identifier to a unique high-dimensional vector embedding learned
during training. This task embedding is combined via element-wise addition with the embedding
produced by the SAM image encoder, as illustrated by Fig. 2.

Experiments

4.1
Experiment Settings

Training Sets We utilize multiple training sets built using the following datasets:

• SA-250K: An unlabeled subset extracted from SA-1B dataset [1] containing 250,000 images.
• HQSeg-44K [4]: A human-annotated set of 44,320 images with high-quality salient-object masks.
• EntitySeg Training Set [63]: A human-annotated set of 31,913 images, each with an average of
20 entity masks, detailing both foreground and background.
• Internal Dataset: A human-annotated set containing 252,798 images with salient-object masks,
60,798 images with entity masks, and 153,046 images focused on human parsing. More details are
provided in Appendix C.

Based on these datasets, we define three fine-tuning (FT) sets with varying budgets of human-
annotated data: (1) FT-Small: SA-250K and HQSeg-44K, enabling a fair comparison with existing
fine-tuning methods such as HQ-SAM [4]; (2) FT-Medium: SA-250K, HQSeg-44K and EntitySeg;
(3) SA-250K and the internal dataset.

Evaluation Sets All the models are evaluated on the same collection of test sets, designed to assess
performance on three different segmentation tasks:

• Salient Object: COIFT [64], validation sets of DIS [65] and ThinObject5K [65], HR-SOD [66],
VOCEVAL [67], and BIG [67]. These datasets contain object-centric images with salient objects
and binary masks. The training sets in DIS-VD and ThinObject5K are included in the HQSeg-44K
dataset. COIFT, HRSOD, VOCEVAL, and BIG are used for zero-shot evaluation.
• Entity: Three EntitySeg [63] validation sets with 454, 459 and 401 images. These sets feature
complex scene images with multiple entities ranging from foreground instances to background
regions (e.g., sky, road).
• Part: Three human/clothing parsing datasets: the validation set of Fashionpedia [68] containing
1,148 images (861 of which have subpart masks), the first 1,000 images of the validation sets of
Multi-Human Parsing [69] and Easyportrait [70]. We also include the first 1,000 images of the
validation set of Paco [71], which contains a wider variety of object types.

Evaluation 1) Metrics: We use standard metrics to evaluate segmentation quality: mean Intersection
over Union (mIoU) and mean boundary IoU (mBIoU). We aggregate these metrics via averaging for
the test datasets in each category. Also, an overall average is derived by aggregating results from
all test datasets. 2) Test prompts: Unless specified otherwise, we generate test prompts using the

7


---Page Break---
center point sampling technique described in SAM [1]. We also report box-prompt segmentation
results in Appendix G. 3) Comparison to single-output model: SAM and SUM generate multiple
masks when a single prompt is provided. For evaluation, we generally select the output mask that
most closely aligns with the provided ground truth. However, when comparing it to HQ-SAM, which
produces a single output, we use a single output fixed in advance.

Baselines We compare the proposed method SUM against the following baselines: (1) Human
annotation only, a method where fine-tuning is exclusively performed with human-labeled data; and
(2) Vanilla, where fine-tuning is performed on unlabeled and human-annotated data following the
standard SAM training protocol, without discriminating between human and SAM pseudo labels.

Implementation Details: SUM is implemented by fine-tuning a SAM model based on a ViT-H
backbone. The experiments were done adhering to SAM’s configuration for loss weighting. Key
training parameters, including learning rate, duration, hyperparameters, and schedules for both
human-annotated and unlabeled data, are detailed in Appendix B. Although the SUM framework
introduces additional steps to generate uncertainty maps, these steps remain manageable within
practical constraints. A detailed discussion on training complexity and computational overhead is
provided in Appendix B.2.

Comparing SUM with SoTA Methods

Comparison with HQ-SAM
Fig. 4 evaluates and compares different fine-tuning strategies, which
are all constrained to utilize the same lightweight fine-tuning scheme and architecture as HQ-SAM [4]
(NeurIPS 2023) for a fair comparison. We compare (1) the proposed SUM method; (2) the original
HQ-SAM, fine-tuned following the Human-Annotation-Only baseline approach (i.e., fine-tuning
exclusively on HQ-Seg-44k); and (3) the vanilla baseline, which utilizes all of FT-Small. Evaluation
is carried out over several rounds of interactive segmentation. HQ-SAM excels in salient-object
segmentation unsurprisingly, as it is fine-tuned on a dataset associated with this segmentation task, but
its performance is worse than the other models for entity and part segmentation (and in fact also worse
than SAM, as shown in Figure 1). Conversely, the vanilla approach, which uses unlabeled data and
SAM pseudo labels, performs worse than HQ-SAM on salient-object segmentation. SUM, utilizing
the same HQ-SAM lightweight structure, achieves similar performance to HQ-SAM on salient-object
segmentation while clearly outperforming all other models on entity and part segmentation. Detailed
dataset-wise comparisons are provided in Appendix G.3.

Comparison with Other Light-weight Fine-tuning Strategies
The left subfigure of Fig. 5 il-
lustrates the comparison of SUM fine-tuned on the FT-Small against various strategies applied
to fine-tune SAM on the human-annotated HQSeg-44k dataset: Decoder+Prompt-Encoder FT:
fine-tuning only the decoder and prompt encoder, Adapter FT: fine-tuning only the Adapter [72]
plugged into the image encoder and LoRA FT: fine-tuning SAM with LoRA [73] in the same way as
SAMed [35]. Our results suggest that fine-tuning SAM exclusively on a specific human-annotated
dataset can easily result in overfitting, regardless of the fine-tuning strategy. Conversely, SUM
enhances the overall performance and mostly retains SAM’s generalization capabilities.

Comparison with Semi-supervised Methods
To assess SUM’s performance relative to other meth-
ods utilizing unlabeled data, we adapt AugSeg [49], a SoTA semi-supervised semantic segmentation
method, to the interactive segmentation pipeline. AugSeg employs a teacher-student framework. For

the human-annotated data, we employ SAM’s training procedure to train the student network, with
both point and box prompts. For the unlabeled data, we apply a consistency loss based on predictions
from two augmented versions of the same image, processed by the student and teacher networks.
Interactive segmentation requires prompt sampled from target labels. We utilize model-generated
pseudo-labels to generate the prompts for unlabeled data in two different ways: 1) AugSeg Mixed-
Prompt employs a combination of point and box prompts, and 2) AugSeg Box-Prompt uses only
box prompts. We provide more implementation details and discussion in Appendix E. As depicted
in the right subfigure of Fig. 5, SUM clearly outperforms both versions, achieving a mIoU of 72.8,
compared to 68.8 for AugSeg Mixed-Prompt, 67.0 for AugSeg Box-Prompt.

The choice of uncertainty quantification is critical for the effectiveness of pseudo-label utilization.
To understand how ours compares with existing uncertainty quantification approaches, we further
evaluate two variants: (1) SUM Confidence-Uncer, which uses logit confidence of SAM prediction to
quantify pseudo-label uncertainty, similar to U2PL [51] (CVPR 2022); (2) SUM Discrepancy-Uncer,
which quantifies uncertainty using the discrepancy between multiple predictions for a target mask,
similar to Zheng et al. [58]’s work (IJCV 2021). Results in the right sub-figure of Fig. 5 indicate that
these variants underperform ours significantly. We also tested an improved U2PL incorporating the
same uncertainty map as SUM and task prompt training, but it still underperforms SUM. Further
details are in Appendix E. We provide 3-point-prompt interactive segmentation comparison in Table 1.
The performance of SUM on part segmentation improves, which is not explicitly represented in the
human annotations. This demonstrates SUM’s capability to enhance accuracy across general tasks.

Performance of SUM under Various Annotation Budgets
In Appendix G.1, we evaluate our
proposed model (SUM) when fine-tuned under various annotation budgets, utilizing the FT-Medium
and FT-Large datasets. SUM achieves consistent improvements regardless of the fine-tuning budgets.

Performance of SUM on Additional Evaluation Sets
To further validate the generalization of
our proposed methods, we have expanded our evaluation by testing SUM and SAM on 8 additional
evaluation sets that include a variety of image types. For reproducibility, SUM is fine-tuned on the
public dataset FT-Medium. As shown in Appendix G.6, SUM consistently outperforms SAM.

Ablation on Uncertainty-aware Training and Task Prompt
Table 2 compares the Vanilla baseline
and the following ablated versions of SUM on public dataset FT-Medium to ensure reproducibility: 1)
Mask Refinement: This variant uses the refined masks produced by the mask-refinement module of
SUM as pseudo labels for the unlabeled images in SA-250K, and is otherwise the same as the Vanilla
baseline. 2) SUM w/o Task Prompt: SUM without task prompts but with uncertainty-aware loss
and sampling. 3) SUM Continuous TP: This is a variant of SUM where the task prompt is utilized
continuously in all rounds of interactive segmentation during training and inference (as opposed to
just in the first round, as in SUM).

The results demonstrate the advantage of uncertainty-aware training over direct mask refinement.
SUM w/o Task Prompt outperforms Mask Refinement, especially for part segmentation, which is
the segmentation task that is not included in the human-annotated labels. Both models outperform
Vanilla, indicating that mask refinement provides an advantage over a naive combination of unlabeled
and labeled data. Additional experiments analyzing mask refinement are reported in Appendix D.

SUM is superior to SUM without Task Prompt across all segmentation tasks for a single-point
prompt, but both models are essentially equivalent for 3 prompts. This suggests that task prompting
is very useful when there is more ambiguity as to which mask is desired by the user. In fact, SUM
Continuous TP underperforms SUM for 3-point prompts, suggesting that persistent task prompting
may be counterproductive as semantic ambiguity decreases.

Additional Ablation In Appendix F.2, we compare SUM to a version of SUM without uncertainty-
aware sampling. In Appendix Table 6, we provide a comprehensive comparison between SAM and
SUM implemented with different backbones, including ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H. Our model consistently
outperforms SAM across different model backbones for all mask types and interactive rounds.
The improvement is most significant for single-point prompt segmentation of salient objects. In
Appendix F.1, we compare SUM and different variants of SUM via different lightweight fine-tuning
methods.

Discussion and Future Work

Fine-tuning foundation models effectively is an important challenge. Our work suggests that a key
consideration is how to account for varying degrees of diversity and label quality in the available data.
Specifically, we show that in the case of segmentation, incorporating a diverse unlabeled dataset can
be effective in preserving the generalization ability of the original foundation model, as long as they
are utilized in an uncertainty-aware manner.

As detailed in Appendix D, our methods have limitations: the quality of mask refinement in SUM
is dependent on the initial performance of the SAM model. This suggests that leveraging SUM
to improve pseudo-label quality in the training data could lead to further improvement. Our work
suggests some possible avenues for future research to improve the training of foundation models.
The uncertainty maps generated by SUM can potentially be used to improve pseudo-label filtering in
foundation-model data engines. In fact, a human study reported in Appendix I found that filtering
approaches utilized in SAM are unable to accurately discern pseudo labels with inaccurate boundaries.
Finally, the efficacy of the proposed task prompts suggests that it may be possible to develop automatic
label-generation schemes to produce pseudo-labels associated with more diverse tasks.

Broader Impacts

We want to comment on potential societal outcomes associated with this work. The training of large-
scale foundation models incurs carbon emissions, which contributes to global warming and raises
concerns about environmental sustainability within the AI research community. Additionally, the
black-box characteristics of these deep-learning models may result in unintended biases in practical
applications. Nonetheless, we hope these effects may be offset to some extent when the models
are applied in domains such as medical image segmentation. We believe that advancements in
accurate segmentation foundation models have positive societal implications across a variety of fields,
including medicine, autonomous driving, and creative content generation.

Implementation Details

B.1
Training

In this section, we present comprehensive training details for our proposed Segmentation with
Uncertainty Model (SUM), including loss functions, optimization strategy, interactive-segmentation
training pipeline, and the selection and use of human-labeled and unlabeled data.

Training Resources
The original SAM [1] model was trained using 256 A100 GPUs. For fine-
tuning, we default to 40 Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs for fine-tuning, contingent on the availability of

18


---Page Break---
these GPUs. Regarding the SUM model deployed in the HQ-SAM framework [4], we adhere to the
HQ-SAM configuration, utilizing 8 GPUs to ensure a fair comparison.

Losses
For the human-annotated data, SUM minimizes the same training loss as SAM: a linear
combination of focal loss [61] and Dice loss [62] with the same ratio of 20:1. For the unlabeled data,
we propose to instead utilize uncertainty-aware versions of both losses, which are then combined in
the same way. The hyperparameter θ in the uncertainty-aware Dice loss is set to 0.6. We study the
effect of varying this hyperparameter in Appendix F.5.

Following SAM, we train the IoU prediction head by optimizing the mean-square-error between
the predicted IoU and the IoU of the predicted mask compared to the target mask. This is then
incorporated into the mask loss, applying a scaling factor of 1.0.

Training Procedure
Following SAM [1], we use the AdamW [74] optimizer. The learning rate
is set at 1 × 10−5. Our fine-tuning process takes 6,000 iterations, which is equivalent to a single
SA-250K epoch, with a batch size of 40 images. To account for GPU memory constraints, we train
with a single image and up to 30 randomly sampled masks per GPU. Consistent with the SAM
framework [1], we apply a layer-wise learning rate decay of 0.8. We do not apply data-augmentation
techniques. SUM is initialized from an SAM ViT-H model. Training is distributed across 40 GPUs.

Interactive Segmentation Training
We conduct interactive training for 7 rounds. The initial round
randomly selects between a bounding box or a point prompt with equal probability. This is followed
by a sequence of five rounds, where point prompts are sampled as follows. ‘Positive’ prompts are
selected from regions within the target mask that are absent in the predicted mask, while ‘negative’
prompts are selected from areas included in the predicted mask but not in the target mask. In line
with the SAM framework, we incorporate an additional round without additional prompts after the
final stage.

Utilization of Human-labeled and Unlabeled Data
We adjust the data sampling strategy to form
the training batches, according to the relative frequency of human-annotated data and unlabeled data.
For FT-Small and FT-Medium we include one human-annotated image for every unlabeled image. In
the case of FT-Large, where human-labeled data surpass unlabeled data, we include one unlabeled
image for every two human-labeled images.

Pseudo-label Generation
In the fully automatic stage of SAM’s data engine [1], the model is
provided with prompts of a 32×32 regular grid of points. The model then predicts a set of masks for
each point. The masks are then filtered to discard low-quality ones. Specifically, there are three filters
in SAM:

• The masks are selected based on the model’s predicted IoU score, setting a minimum
threshold of 88.0.

• For maintaining mask stability, SAM evaluated pairs of binary masks derived from the same
soft mask but thresholded at slightly different values. A mask was retained only if the IoU
between the binary masks, created by thresholding the logits at 0 and then at -1 and +1, was
95.0 or higher.

• Lastly, to eliminate non-informative masks, SAM excluded any mask that occupied 95% or
more of the total image area.

Although the filtering mechanisms succeed in eliminating a significant portion of low-quality masks,
their effectiveness is constrained when it comes to further distinguishing the accuracy of mask
boundaries among the remaining masks. This limitation is evidenced by our human study detailed in
Appendix I.1, which assesses the boundary precision of the filtered masks.

B.2
Training Complexity and Computational Overhead

While the SUM framework adds steps to obtain uncertainty maps, they remain manageable within
practical constraints, as detailed below.

19


---Page Break---
• Training the Uncertainty Map Generation Module: Training the uncertainty map genera-
tion module is relatively efficient on the human-labeled samples. It involves tuning a small
number of parameters and can be completed within 4 hours using 8 A100 GPUs.

• Generating Uncertainty Map for the Unlabeled Image: The computational overhead
introduced by the SUM framework is minimal. The process of generating pseudo labels
and uncertainty maps for unlabeled data utilizes the existing SAM encoder, thereby sharing
the primary computational workload. Beyond pseudo-label generation, the additional time
required to produce refined masks using a lightweight decoder is negligible compared to
the time taken by the image encoder. ViT-H image encoder in SAM has 632M parameters
while the prompt-based decoder only has 3.87M parameters. As per the reference [75], on
an RTX4090, the decoder adds only approximately 2% more computational time compared
to the encoder.

• Fine-Tuning the SAM Model: Once the uncertainty map is generated, the fine-tuning SAM
model using the uncertainty map is similar to the standard training used in SAM.

• Iterative Point Prompt Sampling: This method is used in standard SAM training as well,
and replacing the original uniform sampling with weighted (uncertainty-aware) sampling
results in a negligible training burden. Sampling a point from a 1024x1024 candidate pool
using both methods can be completed within 0.006-0.009 seconds (average of 1000 runs) on
the CPU of a MacBook.

• Task Prompt: The task prompt, a learnable single vector, is combined via element-wise
addition with the embeddings from the SAM image encoder and is used only in the first
round of interactive segmentation. The element-wise addition of two tensors is relatively
fast.

• Uncertainty-aware Loss Computation: This involves thresholding and a weighted loss
computation, which requires a similar running time to the original loss.

• Inference Phase: Uncertainty maps are utilized only during training. Once our model is
trained, inference operates similarly to the SAM model, without additional computational
burden. This results in negligible computational overhead.

B.3
Evaluation

Interactive Segmentation Evaluation
Evaluation is carried out using six interactive segmentation
rounds. The initial prompt may be either a bounding box or a point. Given that point-based prompts
are standard for interactive segmentation evaluations (as utilized in both SAM and HQ-SAM) our
analysis predominantly concentrates on them.

Point-prompt Sampling Method during Evaluation
Our point-prompt sampling during inference
follows the one in SAM [1]. The initial point is deterministically chosen as the one farthest from
the object’s boundary. Subsequent points are selected similarly, as the farthest from the boundary
of the error region between the ground-truth segmentation mask and the model prediction. It was
first introduced by Xu et al. [76] and has become the norm in literature for evaluating interactive
segmentation. It ensures consistency by deterministically selecting the initial point to be farthest
from the object boundary. Subsequent points are placed farthest from the error region’s boundary,
which varies depending on the discrepancies between the ground truth and prior model predictions.
While the initial point is consistent across all models, subsequent points are model-specific, in light
of distinct error patterns.

In order to generate more challenging prompts, in certain experiments we perform boundary sampling
instead. We utilize morphological operations for the precise identification of boundary points within a
specified proximity to the mask’s edge. In our specific configuration, this distance is set to 10 pixels.

Comparison to Single-output Model
Given the possibility of semantic ambiguity when only a
limited number of prompts is provided, we generally opt for a fair comparison strategy: in cases
where several output masks are generated, we select the one that most closely aligns with the provided
ground truth. However, this approach is not applicable in comparisons involving HQ-SAM, which, by
design, produces a deterministic single output. To maintain fairness and consistency when comparing
with HQ-SAM, we only utilize a single output from all other methods (which is fixed beforehand),

20


---Page Break---
even if they have the capability to produce multiple outputs. The single output is set equal to
the estimate corresponding to the fourth output token, following HQ-SAM. We include additional
comparisons between models using deterministic single outputs in Appendix G.5.

Additional Dataset Information

C.1
Training Sets

HQ-Seg-44k
HQ-Seg-44k [4] comprises 44,320 highly precise image mask annotations for the
salient object segmentation task. It was built by merging 6 pre-existing datasets: DIS [65] (train set),
ThinObject-5K [64] (train set), FSS [77], ECSSD [78], MSRA-10K [79], and DUT-OMRON [80].

EntitySeg [63] Train Set
This dataset is a large-scale and high-quality dataset for entity seg-
mentation [81]. It encompasses a diverse array of image domains and entities, enriched with a
vast collection of high-resolution images and superior-quality mask annotations. Additionally, It is
designed to be open-world and not restricted to predefined classes.

Internal Dataset
We collected a high-quality human annotated internal dataset containing 252,798
images with salient-object masks, 60,798 images with entity masks, and 153,046 images focused
on part segmentation, primarily for human parsing and portrait. Each annotation in this dataset has
been meticulously carried out by human annotators. The salient-object masks encompass a wide
range of categories, such as people, vehicles, street signs, animals, household items, kitchenware,
food, furniture, electronics, and personal accessories. The entity masks include both foreground
elements (like people, vehicles, animals) and background components (including sky, road, grass,
water, clouds, and mountains). The part segmentation masks predominantly focus on body parts,
various clothing items, and accessories.

C.2
Evaluation Sets

• Salient Object: We utilize COIFT [64], the validation sets of DIS [65] and ThinOb-
ject5K [65], HR-SOD [66], VOCEVAL [67], and BIG [67]. These datasets contain object-
centric images with salient objects and binary masks. The training sets in DIS-VD and
ThinObject5K are included in the HQSeg-44K dataset. COIFT, HRSOD, VOCEVAL, and
BIG are used for zero-shot evaluation.

• Entity: Three EntitySeg [63] validation sets with 454, 459 and 401 images. These sets
feature complex scene images with multiple entities ranging from foreground instances to
background regions (e.g. sky, road).

• Part: Fashionpedia [68] is a large-scale dataset that contains a comprehensive ontology of
fashion elements. We include the main evaluation set (containing 1148 images) with part
segmentation annotation and a subset with even more fine-grained subpart masks (containing
861 images). We also include 1000 images from each of the Paco, LVIS, Multi-Human
Parsing, and Easyportrait datasets. Paco [71] is an extensive detection dataset that enriches
the traditional scope of object detection by incorporating detailed annotations for object
parts and attributes. The Multi-Human Parsing [69] dataset aims to partition a crowd scene
image into semantically consistent regions belonging to the body parts or clothes items
while differentiating different identities. Easyportrait [70] is a large-scale image dataset for
portrait segmentation and face parsing.

D
Mask-refinement Module

D.1
Design

We built the mask refinement module to identify systematic biases in the SAM pseudo labels before
SUM training. The module is trained by finetuning a separate SAM model with mask-prompt
segmentation on the human-annotated dataset. We limit fine-tuning to the decoder and prompt
encoder, keeping the image encoder fixed, to prevent overfitting. In the final architecture, we only
require the fine-tuned decoder and the prompt encoder, as the encoder is the same as the one in SAM.

21


---Page Break---
D.2
Training

The training data for the mask-refinement module is obtained by generating pseudo masks by applying
SAM to human-annotated datasets. This provides the prompt-target pairings necessary for our fine-
tuning process. These pseudo masks are generated using a single point prompt from each ground
truth mask, mirroring the conditions under which SAM pseudo labels are produced. To address
semantic ambiguity, the mask prompt is set to be the SAM mask output that is most aligned with the
human annotation. We exclude pairs where the IoU between the SAM-generated pseudo label and
the ground truth is below a threshold (set to 0.7). Additionally, we apply the same sample filtering
technique as in SAM during mask generation to ensure mask quality (see Appendix B in SAM [1]).
Fine-tuning is conducted on the prompt-target pairs, as shown in Fig. 6. The mask-refinement module
also receives as input a box prompt encompassing the pseudo label mask, and the point prompt used
to generate the pseudo labels. We empirically found that including isolated box or point prompts is
counterproductive, so they were excluded (see Fig. 7). prompt.

Figure 6: Training of the mask-refinement module: The mask-refinement module is implemented
by fine-tuning the decoder and prompt encoder of SAM. By leveraging SAM’s automatic mask
generation, we acquire initial pseudo labels and corresponding image embeddings. Subsequently,
these pseudo labels undergo a refinement process to produce the refined prediction. During training
the prediction is fit using high-quality, human-annotated.

D.3
Evaluation

The mask-refinement module refines SAM predictions via mask-prompt segmentation. Fig. 7 shows
a comparison between SAM, our proposed mask-refinement module and three versions of HQ-SAM:

• HQ-SAM – Original HQ-SAM model that uses distorted ground truth as the mask prompt
during training.

• HQ-SAM MP – Same as HQ-SAM but without incorporating separate box or point prompts
during training.

• HQ-SAM MP w SAM pseudo label – Same as HQ-SAM MP but using SAM-generated
pseudo labels as the mask prompt in place of the distorted ground truth, the approach taken
by the original HQ-SAM.

For a fair comparison, all model variants were fine-tuned using only the HQSeg-44K [4] dataset,
which contains human-annotated masks associated to the salient object segmentation task. The
SAM pseudo labels are generated using using a single point prompt sampled from the ground truth
segmentation mask. The proposed mask-refinement module clearly outperforms the alternatives,
which overfit the salient-object segmentation task.

Fig. 8 presents an ablation analysis of the mask-refinement module, comparing the following ablated
models fine-tuned using only the HQSeg-44K [4] :

• Without Filtering – Proposed mask-refinement module without pseudo-label filtering,
which disregards pairs with an IoU below a set threshold.

• With Synthetic Label – Utilizes synthetic labels as mask prompt in training.

suffers from overfitting to specific tasks. HQ-SAM MP, which limits HQ-SAM to mask-prompt
segmentation tasks while omitting individual box or point prompts during training achieves better
generalization. Additional incorporation of SAM-generated pseudo labels yields improved results.
Our mask-refinement module achieves the best performance.

• With MAE Encoder – Employs an encoder pretrained with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)
weights.
• With Encoder Adapter – Incorporates a lightweight adapter into the image encoder.

The ablation results show that the proposed design clearly outperforms the ablated alternatives,
particularly in terms of generalization to other segmentation tasks.

Table 3 presents the outcomes of utilizing the same mask-refinement module featured in Fig 7 and 8
to refine SAM predictions that were generated using a one-box prompt. The results demonstrate that
our approach is also capable of refining pseudo labels generated by box prompts.

In Fig.9, we present a scatter plot that compares the boundary IoU of SAM predictions (produced
using a single-point prompt) before and after refinement masks using the HRSOD dataset. For the
majority of examples, mask-refinement module enhances the quality of the SAM prediction. However,
in some cases the refined outputs are worse than the original prediction. Motivated in part by this,
we propose leveraging the refined prediction via uncertainty-aware training instead. To evaluate the
correlation between certainty (1-uncertainty) and SAM pseudo-label accuracy: we used the HRSOD
dataset and set a threshold of 0.6 on the certainty, to identify regions high and low certainty areas.
Results show that high-certainty regions have a superior accuracy (acc: 98%) over the uncertain ones
(acc: 28.5%). When the threshold is 0.8, the accuracy in high-certainty regions increases to 99.2%,
indicating a positive correlation between certainty and pseudo-label accuracy.

E.1
Implementation Details

AugSeg
AugSeg [49] employs a teacher-student framework. Following SAM [1], we use the
AdamW [74] optimizer. The learning rate is set at 1 × 10−5.

For the human-annotated data, we employ SAM’s training procedure to train the student network,
with both point and box prompts. We conduct interactive segmentation for 7 rounds. We minimize
the same training loss as SAM: a linear combination of focal loss [61] and Dice loss [62] with the
same ratio of 20:1.

For the unlabeled data, we apply a consistency loss based on predictions from two augmented versions
of the same image, processed by the student and teacher networks. We binarize the prediction from
the teacher network as the target, focal loss and Dice loss are added between the prediction from the
teacher network and student network with a weight ratio of 20:1. We found that this works better than
directly computing the KL divergence or mean square errors between two predictions. We follow the
augmentation process in [49]. Interactive segmentation requires prompts sampled from target labels.
We utilize model-generated pseudo-labels to generate the prompts for unlabeled data in two different
ways:

• AugSeg Mixed-Prompt, which employs a combination of the point and box prompts. In
scenarios where only a single prompt is employed, it may be either a point or a box prompt.
Conversely, when multiple prompts are utilized, they may either be a mix of point and box
prompts or exclusively point prompts;

• AugSeg Box-Prompt, which exclusively employs box prompts, applicable solely in single
prompt scenarios.

In scenarios where a single prompt (either point or box) is provided, SAM is designed to yield three
outputs to accommodate ambiguity associated with the target mask. To incorporate consistency loss
between two sets of predictions, we explored two approaches:

• AugSeg Mixed-Prompt This is the default setting, where we select the most similar pre-
diction to the pseudo-label from each set, and add consistency loss between these two
predictions. This approach aligns with the SAM training protocol, where only the prediction
most closely matches the target mask is considered for loss calculation.

• AugSeg Mixed-Prompt(multi-consistency) This variant computes the consistency loss
between corresponding predictions from both sets, as determined by the same output token.
Given that there are three output tokens (each for one output) for single-prompt scenarios,
this results in three separate consistency losses.

In addition to sampling prompts from the pseudo-label, we employ a uniform prompt sampling
strategy, denoted as AugSeg Uniform Point-Prompt. This approach is akin to the automatic mask
generation process utilized in SAM. Specifically, we provide the model with a regular grid of points
as prompts. For each point, the model predicts a set of masks potentially representing valid objects.
We then compute the consistency loss between the corresponding predictions from both sets, as
determined by the same output token. Such a non-discriminatory approach is feasible exclusively
in single prompt scenarios, given the absence of target masks for interactive prompt sampling.
However, employing this strategy has resulted in significantly inferior outcomes in our experiments.
One plausible explanation could be the absence of filtering mechanisms similar to those in SAM’s
pseudo-label generation process, resulting in the retention of plenty low-quality predictions serving
as regularization targets.

In the Table 4, we report the single-point prompt mean IoU comparison of different model variants
fine-tuned on FT-Small. This shows that adding multiple consistency losses actually hurts the model
performance.

For multi-prompt scenarios, we sample interactive prompts for both teacher and student networks
based on SAM pseudo-labels.

all other strategies. Note that AugSeg Box-Prompt is not applicable as explained in Appendix E.

U2PL
Besides the standard loss function for both labeled and unlabeled examples, U2PL [51] also
employs a contrastive loss to regularize the encoder’s image embeddings based on the uncertainty of
pseudo labels.

The original U2PL method relies on the confidence of model prediction logits for uncertainty
quantification. However, our experiments show that this approach does not perform well with the
segmentation foundation model. A possible explanation is that the foundation model, trained on a
substantial volume of labeled and unlabeled data, begins with relatively high initial quality. This
contrasts sharply with semi-supervised settings, where both data and labels are limited. To ensure a
fair comparison, we adopt the same uncertainty map as used in SUM for the U2PL. Additionally,
we incorporate task prompts into the U2PL framework. Following SAM [1], our training loss
incorporates both pseudo and human labels, with an added contrastive loss as specified in the original
paper.

Following SAM [1], we use the AdamW [74] optimizer. The learning rate is set at 1 × 10−5.

For the human-annotated data, we employ SAM’s training procedure to train the student network,
with both point and box prompts. We conduct interactive segmentation for 7 rounds. We minimize
the same training loss as SAM: a linear combination of focal loss [61] and Dice loss [62] with the
same ratio of 20:1. In addition to the standard SAM loss, we also incorporate a contrastive loss in
the embedding space for the pseudo-labeled data, we search the loss weight and find setting the
contrastive loss weight to be 1 gets the best performance.

However, U2PL performance falls short of that achieved by SUM. This suggests that merely adding
uncertainty to the image embedding space, while continuing to train the prediction space with noisy
pseudo labels, is less effective. We additionally provide the three-point prompt comparison results plot
corresponding to Table 1 in Fig 11. From this, we observe that AugSeg’s performance is comparable
to that of Vanilla, while SUM surpasses both in terms of these metrics.

SUM Discrepancy-Uncertainty
In this variant of the SUM model (SUM Discrepancy-Uncertainty),
we adopt methodologies previously established for domain adaptive segmentation by Araslanov et
al. [59] and Zheng et al. [58]. This involves generating two distinct predictions for a specified target
mask and using the discrepancy between these predictions to quantify uncertainty.

We evaluated two different architectures: a conventional teacher-student framework, as described by
Araslanov and Roth [59], and a dual-decoder structure based on the work of Zheng et al. [58]. In the
latter, a single encoder feeds into two separate decoders that each produce a prediction. To clarify the
target mask for prediction, we employed a bounding box derived from the pseudo label as a prompt.
Our experimental results indicate that the teacher-student framework generally outperforms the dual-
decoder setup. Nonetheless, neither approach matches the efficacy of our proposed method, which
involves training a specialized mask refinement module utilizing high-quality human annotations.

E.2
Discussion

Semi-supervised Segmentation
Directly integrating AugSeg within the interactive segmentation
framework did not outperform the performance of directly utilizing SAM pseudo-labels as targets (i.e.
the Vanilla baseline). We identify several potential avenues for enhancing semi-supervised methods
in interactive segmentation scenarios:

• Designing better semi-supervised methods for interactive segmentation necessitates a better
framework for prompt sampling. Generating prompts from model-generated pseudo-labels
for unlabeled data is crucial. Here, the concept of uncertainty-aware prompt sampling, as
introduced in SUM, shows potentials to improve model performance by avoiding producing
misleading prompt locations.
• Moreover, the occasional inaccuracies in the output of the teacher network, which provides
a guiding target mask for the student network’s training, suggest that incorporating an
uncertainty-aware component into the loss function could further refine performance.
• Our approach follows SAM, where consistency is enforced between the model’s predictions
and the pseudo-labels. The intuition is that the model should yield consistent outcomes in
line with the pseudo-labels, despite variations in the sampling locations of the prompts from
these pseudo-labels. This is orthogonal to augmentation-based semi-supervised strategies.
Exploring the potential combination between the augmentation-based semi-supervised
strategies and our proposed approach presents a compelling avenue for future research.

Uncertainty-aware Segmentation
Our approach differs fundamentally from previous approaches
of uncertainty-aware segmentation in both 1) the generation of uncertainty maps and 2) the utilization
of these uncertainty maps, as detailed below. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript.

The uncertainty-aware fine-tuning strategies generate uncertainty via model prediction logit values [51,
57], or use prediction differences from different heads to generate uncertainty [59, 58]. They are
designed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation or semi-supervised semantic segmentation,
where labels or data are scarce, and segmentation quality is typically low. These methods are also
specific to the limited task. In contrast, our proposed strategy is designed for the interactive binary
segmentation foundation model, which has not been tackled by the previous method.

• Uncertainty Map Generation: Our main insight is to utilize external supervision to
detect and correct systematic biases that accumulate during training. This design logic is
fundamentally different from relying on the model self-training itself, as most previous
models [51, 57]. SAM undergoes several rounds of self-training, leading to the accumulation
and overfitting of errors in pseudo-labels. In our evaluation, the model frequently predicts
erroneous regions with high confidence, and different heads concur on these incorrect areas
due to the memorization of label noise [60]. Therefore, previous methods [51, 57, 59, 58] to
generate uncertainty maps, do not capture this uncertainty effectively. To further improve
segmentation quality, it is logical to integrate a form of scalable external supervision. This
serves to identify and address the systematic biases that have accumulated during the training
of foundation models. Our investigation into the design of mask-refinement models is an
initial endeavor in this regard, and we are optimistic about future advancements in this field.
• Utilization of the Uncertainty Map: Our method is the first to introduce uncertainty-
aware prompt sampling for training interactive segmentation models, representing a novel
contribution to the field. In contrast, the semantic segmentation tasks addressed in [51, 57]
do not involve prompt sampling. Additionally, we have tailored the uncertainty-aware focal
and Dice loss to train the binary segmentation foundation model. They are not proposed
in [51, 57].

28


---Page Break---
Quantitative comparison with previous methods: As reported in Table 1, the proposed SUM method
outperforms existing methods based on uncertainty quantification [57, 58], "SUM Confidence-Uncer"
corresponds to [57], and "SUM Discrepancy-Uncer" corresponds to [58]. Table 1 also provides a
comparison with UP2L [51], an uncertainty-aware semi-supervised segmentation method that uses
uncertainty maps in the feature space via contrastive learning, which also performs worse than SUM
(see also Figure 5).

Continual Learning for Segmentation
We also want to comment on how our setting differs
from the typical frameworks of continual learning in segmentation. Most of the papers on continual
learning for segmentation are designed for class-incremental segmentation. However, in our case, it
is not clear how to adopt such an idea for the binary mask segmentation case, where the aim is to not
forget different segmentation tasks. Notably, several seminal studies within this domain focus on
model weight distillation, creating a loss function that minimizes the discrepancy between predictions
from previous and current models. This concept parallels the pseudo-labeling approach utilized in
the SAM paper, which aims to maintain the prediction to be similar to pseudo-labels associated with
different tasks.

Furthermore, some techniques strive to preserve previously learned knowledge by distilling inter-
mediate feature maps. However, our experiments indicate that despite employing strategies like
freezing the image encoder or using minimally light-weight fine-tuning methods such as HQ-SAM,
task-specific knowledge degradation, or forgetting, still occurs in segmentation tasks.

the decoder, the prompt encoder and the Adapter [72] plugged in the image encoder, (2) using
the same lightweight fine-tuning scheme and architecture as HQ-SAM, (3) fine-tuning the whole
SAM (the default setting). We observe that all variants of SUM outperform SAM on salient-object
segmentation and retain the performance on entity and part segmentation. Besides, full fine-tuning
clearly outperforms the other models.

All the ablation experiments are carried out on the public dataset FT-Medium to ensure reproducibility.

Uncertainty-aware Sampling

Fig. 13 compares SUM to a version of SUM without uncertainty-aware sampling on two evaluation
datasets (DIS-VD and ThinkObject5K val datasets), which contain objects with intricate structures.
When evaluating, we provide prompts located close to the object boundaries, which are more
challenging for the models. We observe that SUM with uncertainty-aware sampling has much better
performance.

We compare SUM to a version of SUM without uncertainty-aware sampling during training for
one-point segmentation in Table 5. When evaluating, we provide prompts located close to the object
boundaries, which are more challenging for the models (see Appendix B.3). We observe that SUM
fine-tuned with uncertainty-aware sampling has much better performance, especially for datasets

Threshold for the Uncertainty-aware Dice Loss

In Fig. 16, we present an ablation study of the uncertainty-aware Dice loss threshold, denoted by θ. A
smaller θ implies greater reliance on the pseudo labels. Our findings indicate that overly low values
of θ adversely affect the model’s performance in salient object and entity segmentation due to the
effects of pseudo label noise. On the contrary, excessively high θ values may prevent the model from
effectively leveraging part segmentation masks from the pseudo labels.

Additional Quantitative Results

G.1
Performance of SUM under Various Annotation Budgets

In this section we evaluate our proposed model (SUM) when fine-tuned under various annotation
budgets, utilizing the FT-Medium and FT-Large datasets. We focus on point prompts and mean IoU.
Additional results for box-prompt and mean Boundary IoU are provided in Appendix G.2. More
granular dataset-wise results are reported in Appendix G.4.

FT-Medium
Fig. 17 shows a comparison between the Human-Annotation-Only baseline fine-tuned
on HQ-Seg-44k and EntitySeg train set, SUM fine-tuned on FT-Medium (including SA-250K) and
SAM. The Human-Annotation-Only baseline and SUM outperform SAM on the segmentation tasks
associated with the human-annotated data (salient-object and entity segmentation). Although the
Human-Annotation-Only baseline suffers a dramatic decrease in performance on part segmentation,
the performance of SUM on part segmentation actually improves with respect to SAM by 3 points
in mean IoU. This is notable because part segmentation is not explicitly represented in the human
annotations, demonstrating SUM’s capability to enhance accuracy across general tasks.

training sets. Fine-tuning only using human annotations improves performance for the tasks associated
with the annotations (salient-object and entity segmentation), but deteriorates it dramatically for part
segmentation.

FT-Large
Fig. 18 compares the Human-Annotation-Only baseline fine-tuned on the large-scale
human-annotated internal train set, SUM, and the Vanilla baseline fine-tuned on FT-Large (including
SA-250K). Human-Annotation-Only and SUM outperform Vanilla on salient-object segmentation.
The three models perform similarly on entity segmentation. SUM is clearly superior in part segmen-
tation. This shows the advantages of leveraging unlabeled data via SUM, even when the available
human-annotated dataset is large-scale and diverse.

performance for the tasks associated with the annotations (salient-object and entity segmentation),
but deteriorates it for part segmentation in the case of one prompt. Since the box prompt has less
semantic ambiguity compared to point prompts, the decrease is not as dramatic.

Dataset-wise Comparison with HQ-SAM

Here, we provide the dataset-wise performance comparison of HQ-SAM (fine-tuned on HQ-Seg-44k)
with Vanilla and SUM fine-tuned using the same lightweight scheme as HQ-SAM on FT-Small
(HQ-Seg-44k and SA-250k).

We provide interactive segmentation results where the first prompt is a point in Table 10 (single-
point-prompt segmentation) and Table 11 (six-point-prompt segmentation).

We provide interactive segmentation results where the first prompt is a box in Table 12 (single-box-
prompt segmentation) and Table 13 (starting with a box prompt followed by five point prompts).

Table 10: Single-point-prompt evaluation. This table shows the comparison of HQ-SAM (fine-tuned
on HQ-Seg-44k) with Vanilla and SUM fine-tuned using the same lightweight scheme as HQ-SAM.
SUM is superior in all the tasks.

Table 13: Six rounds interactive segmentation evaluation with initial box prompt. This table
shows the comparison of HQ-SAM (fine-tuned on HQ-Seg-44k) with Vanilla and SUM fine-tuned
using the same lightweight scheme as HQ-SAM. SUM matches HQ-SAM and outperforms Vanilla in
salient-object segmentation, and is superior in entity and part segmentation.

Dataset-wise Comparison with SAM

Here, we provide the dataset-wise performance comparison of SAM with SUM fine-tuned in a full
parameter fine-tuning manner on different train sets: FT-Small, FT-Medium, and FT-Large.

We provide interactive segmentation results where the first prompt is a point in Table 14 (single-point-
prompt segmentation), Table 15 (five-point-prompt segmentation) and Table 16 (six-point-prompt
segmentation).

We provide interactive segmentation results where the first prompt is a box in Table 17 (single-
box-prompt segmentation) and Table 18 (Prompts: a box as first prompt and following 5 point
prompts).

Table 14: Single-point-prompt evaluation Comparison of SAM with SUM fine-tuned on FT-Small,
FT-Medium, and FT-Large. SUM achieves consistent overall improvement compared to SAM, it
improves more when more human-annotated data is included.

SUM vs SAM under the Single Output Evaluation Setting

In this section, we provide a single output evaluation of SAM and SUM fine-tuned on different
train sets (FT-Small, FT-Medium, and FT-Large). We provide the IoU evaluation in Fig. 28 and
boundary IoU evaluation in Fig. 29. In this setting, only one output is provided when a single prompt
is provided, as specified in Appendix B.3.

Results on Additional Evaluation Sets

We organize our evaluation tasks in the experiment according to the hierarchical level of granularity,
covering various levels (part, entity, multiple instances). Each task is evaluated using several
diverse datasets designed to encompass a wide range of images and subtasks. For instance, our part
segmentation evaluation utilizes five diverse datasets: Fashionpedia, Fashionpedia Subpart, Paco,
Multi-Human Parsing, and Portrait. The first two include a comprehensive ontology of fashion
elements and different levels of part granularity. Paco covers 75 object classes and the last two focus
on different human-specific part segmentation subtasks.

To further strengthen the robustness of our proposed methods, we have extended our evaluation
by testing SUM and SAM on additional image types. For reproducibility, SUM is fine-tuned on
the Public dataset FT-Medium. We selected 7 datasets from the evaluation sets used in SAM to
complement our existing 14 public evaluation sets. Additionally, we have included part one of a
synthetic dataset, GTAV [82]. These additional evaluation sets encompass various image types e.g.
driving, synthetic, egocentric, irregular shapes, paintings, underwater animals, drones, and underwater
trash.

The mIoU comparison results, reported in the Table 19, confirm that SUM consistently outperforms
SAM.

fine-tuned following the Human-Annotation-Only baseline approach (i.e. fine-tuning exclusively on
HQ-Seg-44k). Fig. 40, Fig. 43, and Fig. 42 show different examples. Additionally, we show several
examples for the part segmentation task in Fig. 43.

Human Evaluation

I.1
SAM Pseudo Label Quality

In this section, we report a comprehensive human evaluation on a subset of the SA-1B dataset,
consisting of 20,000 randomly selected masks. The evaluation protocol involves a series of questions
designed to assess the quality of the segmentation masks in terms of coverage, boundary precision,
and object part identification.

The criteria for evaluation are defined as follows:

• Coverage: This criterion determines whether a mask accurately encompasses the target object
or region within an image. It is deemed ‘correct’ if the mask captures the entire object or region
without fragmentation or inclusion of adjacent non-target entities. While exact adherence to the
object’s edges is not mandatory, the mask must include all components of the object or specified
area. For objects that are part of a larger entity, correct coverage is achieved when the mask fully
encloses the object’s subset. The coverage is labeled as ‘undecided’ if the object’s boundaries are
indiscernible, such as in conditions of poor visibility or when edges are occluded.
• Boundary: This aspect examines how well a mask’s edges align with the actual boundary of the
target entity. A boundary is considered ‘accurate’ if the mask’s periphery matches the entity’s
contours throughout. Conversely, a boundary is ‘inaccurate’ if there is a noticeable discrepancy
between the mask’s edges and the entity’s true outline, irrespective of overall coverage adequacy.
Similar to coverage, the boundary is rated as ‘undecided’ when the true edges of the entity are not
clearly distinguishable, which may occur in conditions of low visibility or obstruction.
• Part: Human participants respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to determine if the masked region represents
a portion of another object. The term ‘part’ specifically refers to a segmented region that is a
constituent of a larger object. In contrast, standalone entities such as a person, animal, or car are
not considered ‘parts.’ Similar to the previous two categories, we also provide ‘undecided’ option
in case it is not clearly distinguishable.

Figure 44: Human evaluation of SAM pseudo label quality. We conducted a human evaluation
on randomly selected 20,000 masks in the SA-1B dataset. While the overall coverage of the object
masks is satisfactory, the boundaries are predominantly of poor quality.

Fig. 44 shows some key findings:

1. Approximately 55.6% of the pseudo labels were identified with boundary inaccuracies.
2. About 81.2% of the labels were adjudged to have accurate coverage.
3. 52.7% were classified as part masks.

This analysis yields valuable insights, indicating that while the overall coverage of the object masks is
satisfactory, the boundaries are predominantly of poor quality. Consequently, refining masks emerges
as a viable approach to enhance mask quality without necessitating significant alterations to the
original pseudo labels in many cases.

In addition, we studied the sample filtering metrics used in SAM. SAM utilizes two key metrics,
Predicted IoU and Stability Score, for pseudo label filtering. For a more detailed description of the

63


---Page Break---
two metrics, please refer to Appendix B (automatic mask generation details) in [1]. Here, our analysis
is specifically focused on examining the role of the filtering metrics in further discerning the quality
of pseudo labels that have already been subjected to an initial filtering phase.

Fig. 45 and Fig. 46 show the results. For boundary accuracy, the Predicted IoU did not show significant
variance between accurate and inaccurate classifications (p-value = 0.548), unlike the Stability Score
(p-value = 0.00087). In terms of coverage accuracy, both Predicted IoU (p-value = 0.037) and
Stability Score (p-value = 5.83e-06) displayed significant differences between correct and incorrect
categorizations. However, the observed overlap in both metrics across quality categories suggests
limitations in their discriminative ability to accurately assess boundary accuracy and coverage after
the initial filtering.

Figure 47: This figure presents the outcomes of a human evaluation comparing segmentation masks.
A total of 2,000 mask pairs, randomly selected from the SA-1B dataset, were assessed for boundary
accuracy and coverage. Participants were tasked with determining the accuracy of mask boundaries
and the adequacy of target area coverage, choosing between the SAM Pseudo Label and Ours
Refined for each metric, or indicating if both labels were satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The results
demonstrate a clear preference for masks refined by our module, highlighting improvements in
boundary quality without compromising the comprehensive coverage of the original SAM masks.
Semantic correspondence between the original and refined masks was also verified.

Mask-refinement Module

We tested whether the proposed mask-refinement module improves the quality of SAM pseudo labels
via human evaluation. Participants were presented with the task of comparing segmentation masks
generated by the SAM pseudo label approach against those refined by our mask-refinement module.
We randomly selected 2,000 mask pairs from the SA-1B dataset to undergo comparison. To ensure a
fair comparison, we randomized the listing order of the two segmentation masks for each pair. The
evaluation was focused on two key quality metrics:

• Boundary Accuracy: Participants were asked to assess the accuracy of the mask’s boundary
in relation to the true outline of the target object. The options provided for the judgment
included: (i) SAM Pseudo Label, indicating that the original SAM-generated mask had more
accurate boundaries, (ii) Ours Refined, denoting more accurate boundary of our refined
mask, and (iii) Both Labels are Bad or Both Labels are Good, to reflect situations where
neither or both approaches were satisfactory.
• Coverage: For the coverage metric, participants evaluated the extent to which the mask
encompasses the intended target area without including extraneous regions or omitting
portions of the object. The same response options were provided as for the boundary
accuracy assessment.
• Semantic Correspondence: Participants reviewed whether the masks align in terms of their
semantic categories. For instance, a part mask in one should correspond to a part mask in the
other; similarly, an instance mask should not encompass multiple entities if its counterpart
does not.

Fig. 47 presents the human evaluation results, which demonstrate the improved accuracy in boundary
quality of our refined masks over the original SAM pseudo labels. Our approach also preserves
the extensive coverage of the SAM model’s masks. Additionally, there is a confirmed semantic
correspondence between the pseudo and refined masks.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we provide the context and the experiments to support the main claims of the
paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we provide discussions on the limitations of the proposed method in the main
paper section 5 and further discussion in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

68


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: the paper does not include theoretical results

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we provide detailed descriptions of the implementations, including the dataset,
and training resources, optimization functions etc in Section 4.1 and Appendix B

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

69


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: all the public dataset are available according to separate licenses as detailed in
Appendix A.1. Some internal dataset is not licensed to be public. Some parts of the code are
made available.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we provide detailed descriptions of the settings of the experiment both in the
main paper and the Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: we follow the common practices of the segmentation domain and the previous
papers, which do not provide the error bar due to extensive computational requirements.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

70


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide such information in the Appendix B.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we have reviewed the Code of Ethics and fully obey it.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide that in the Appendix A.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

71


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: we currently do not release the model.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we provide the license and the requirements in the Appendix A.1.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [No]
Justification: no new assets are introduced.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
