Figure 1: Conceptual Illustration of GSDF. Rendering and reconstruction tasks have traditionally
involved trade-offs in neural representation methods. While 3D-GS achieves high-fidelity view-
dependent rendering, it often compromises on geometric accuracy. Recent approaches [13, 10] use
explicit regularization to align Gaussian primitives near surfaces, but this can reduce model capacity
for high-fidelity visuals. Our GSDF introduces a dual-branch framework with specialized GS- and
SDF-branches for rendering and geometry tasks. We propose three mutual guidances (detailed in
Sec. 3.2) to enhance the quality of both tasks.

Abstract

Representing 3D scenes from multiview images remains a core challenge in com-
puter vision and graphics, requiring both reliable rendering and reconstruction,
which often conflicts due to the mismatched prioritization of image quality over pre-
cise underlying scene geometry. Although both neural implicit surfaces and explicit
Gaussian primitives have advanced with neural rendering techniques, current meth-
ods impose strict constraints on density fields or primitive shapes, which enhances
the affinity for geometric reconstruction at the sacrifice of rendering quality. To
address this dilemma, we introduce GSDF, a dual-branch architecture combining
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). Our ap-
proach leverages mutual guidance and joint supervision during the training process
to mutually enhance reconstruction and rendering. Specifically, our method guides
the Gaussian primitives to locate near potential surfaces and accelerates the SDF
convergence. This implicit mutual guidance ensures robustness and accuracy in
both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method boosts the SDF optimization process to reconstruct more detailed geometry,
while reducing floaters and blurry edge artifacts in rendering by aligning Gaussian
primitives with the underlying geometry.

Introduction

Recent advancements in neural scene representations have showcased superior rendering capabilities
[23, 24, 17], these advancements have sparked significant interest in neural surface reconstruction [39,
31, 19, 32, 10, 13]. They seek to develop unified representations, which simultaneously support high-
fidelity rendering and accurate geometric reconstruction, to better support downstream applications
such as robotics [16, 27], physical simulations [35, 8], and XR applications [36, 15].

Although both neural implicit surfaces and explicit Gaussian primitives have advanced with neural
rendering techniques, current methods often suffer from a mismatched prioritization between appear-
ance and geometry. Imposing regularization or constraints on the unified representation may boost
one task, while unavoidably deteriorating the performance of the other. Recent approaches [10, 5],
have explored using flat Gaussian primitives for surface modeling. Enforcing binary opacity [10] and
jointly learned NeuS models [5] to regularize attributes have led to degraded rendering quality due to
primitive constraints. However, works such as Adaptive Shell [34], Binary Occupancy Field [26], and
Scaffold-GS [21] have demonstrated that incorporating geometry guidance significantly enhances
rendering quality by producing well-regularized spatial structures with hybrid representations.

Building on these insights, we propose a synchronously optimized dual-branch system, addressing
rendering and reconstruction with hybrid representations, to bypass the conflicts and further achieve
mutual enhancements, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Our method leverages mutual guidance and joint
supervision to balance rendering and reconstruction without compromising their intrinsic advantages.
Specifically, our system features a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) branch for rendering and a Signed
Distance Field (SDF) branch for surface reconstruction. The key innovations of our approach include:
(1) Utilizing rasterized depth from the GS-branch to guide ray sampling in the SDF-branch, enhancing
volume rendering efficiency and avoiding local minima. (2) Applying SDF-guidance for density
control in 3DGS, directing the growth of 3D Gaussians in near-surface regions and pruning elsewhere.
(3) Aligning geometry properties (depth and normal) estimated from both branches. This unified
system overcomes the limitations inherent in each method due to differences in rendering techniques
(rasterization vs. dense ray sampling) and scene representation (discrete primitives vs. continuous
fields). Moreover, our framework is designed to accommodate future advancements in each branch.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our dual-branch design allows: 1) The GS-branch to generate
structured primitives closely aligned with the surface, reducing floaters and improving detail and
edge quality in view synthesis. 2) Accelerated convergence in the SDF-branch, resulting in superior
geometric accuracy and enhanced surface details. Our results confirm that an integrated blend of both
reconstruction and rendering is achievable, enhancing overall robustness and performance.

Advanced Neural Rendering Techniques.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [23] have achieved
remarkable photorealistic rendering with view-dependent effects. They use Multi-Layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) to map 3D spatial locations to color and density, which are then aggregated into pixel colors
through neural volumetric rendering. This approach excels in novel view synthesis but is slow due to
the need for extensive point sampling along each ray and the global MLP architecture’s scalability
limitations. Recent research [24, 37, 4, 9] has shifted the learning burden to locally optimized
spatial features, enhancing scalability. Alternative methods like rasterizing geometric primitives (e.g.,
point clouds) [2, 41] offer efficiency and flexibility but struggle with discontinuities and outliers.
Augmenting points with neural features and incorporating volumetric rendering [38] improves quality
but adds computational overhead. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [17] revolutionized neural
rendering by using anisotropic 3D Gaussians as primitives, sorted by depth and rasterized onto a
2D screen with α-blending. This method achieves high-quality, detailed results at real-time frame
rates. Scaffold-GS [21] enhanced 3DGS by introducing a hierarchical structure that aligns anchors
with scene geometry, improving rendering quality and memory efficiency. However, these methods
prioritize view synthesis over accurate scene geometry, often resulting in fuzzy volumetric density
fields that hinder the extraction of high-quality surfaces

Neural Surface Reconstruction.
The success of neural rendering has sparked significant interest in
neural surface reconstruction [25, 39, 31, 19, 32, 40]. These methods typically use coordinate-based
networks to encode scene geometry through occupancy fields or Signed Distance Field (SDF) values.

Figure 2: Overview of Dual-branch Guidance. Our dual-branch framework includes a GS-branch
for rendering and an SDF-branch for learning neural surfaces. This design preserves the efficiency and
fidelity of Gaussian primitive for rendering [17, 21] while accurately approximating scene surfaces
from an SDF field adapted from NeuS [31]. Specifically: (1) The GS-branch renders depth maps to
guide SDF-branch ray sampling, querying absolute SDF values |s| and sampling points within 2k|s|
(e.g., k = 4). (2) Predicted SDF values guide GS-branch density control, growing Gaussians near
surfaces and pruning deviated ones. (3) Mutual geometry consistency is enforced by comparing depth
and normal maps from both branches, ensuring coherent alignment between Gaussians and surfaces.

While MLPs with volume rendering produce smooth and complete surfaces, they often lack high-
fidelity details and are slow to optimize. Recent works [19, 34, 26] have leveraged multi-resolution
hashed feature grids from iNGP [24] to enhance representation power, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Hybrid approaches combining surface and volume rendering [30, 34, 26] have also emerged
to maintain rendering speed and quality. More recently, methods have explored integrating 3D
Gaussian Splatting for surface learning. For example, SuGaR [10] aligns 3D Gaussians with potential
surfaces by approximating them to 2D planar primitives with binary opacity. Similarly, 2D Gaussian
Splatting [13] replaces 3D Gaussians with 2D Gaussians for more accurate ray-splat intersection
and regularizes depth maps to enforce a more condensed Gaussian primitive distribution. Another
approach [7] optimizes Gaussian surfels constrained by a normal prior from a pre-trained monocular
estimator, enhancing surface representation. The concurrent work NeuSG [5] jointly optimizes 3D
Gaussian Splatting with NeuS [31] by encouraging flat 3D Gaussians as well, with normals aligned
with NeuS predictions. 3DGSR [22] also aligns the geometry from 3DGS with a SDF field. Despite
advances in neural surface reconstruction, a fidelity gap persists due to the explicit regularization of
Gaussian primitives, which hampers rendering quality compared to 3DGS. Our method optimizes
primitives aligned with surfaces using geometric clues, enhancing structural integrity without losing
representational power.

Method

We present a dual-branch framework with GS- and SDF-branches, jointly optimized to provide
mutual guidance, as shown in Fig. 2. Our approach aligns Gaussian primitives with surfaces using
geometric clues rather than constraining their shapes, enhancing both structure and representational
power. These improved primitives yield more accurate and detailed scene surfaces.

In Sec.3.1, we briefly review neural rendering methods[17, 21] and neural implicit surface representa-
tions [31, 19]. Sec.3.2 details our framework and the three proposed mutual guidance techniques.
Sec.3.3 outlines our training strategy and loss design.

Preliminary

3D Gaussian Splatting.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [17] represents scenes using 3D Gaussian
primitives, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed with a tile-based rasterizer. Each
Gaussian is defined by its mean µ ∈R3 and covariance Σ ∈R3×3 with G(x) = e−1

2 (x−µ)T Σ−1(x−µ),
where x is a 3D position in the scene. The rasterizer efficiently sorts and α-blends Gaussians onto
the 2D image plane [43]. The adaptive control of Gaussians based on gradients is also critical for
improving scene representation accuracy, reducing redundancy, and refining Gaussians to better
match the underlying geometry and appearance.

Scaffold-GS [21] improves 3DGS by enhancing scene structure fidelity and robustness to view-
dependent effects. It uses a hierarchical 3D Gaussian representation, with anchor points encoding
local scene information and generating local neural Gaussians. Each anchor, optimized with a feature
vector, predicts the color, center, variance, and opacity of the neural Gaussians.

Neural Implicit SDFs.
NeuS [31] integrates signed distance functions (SDFs) with NeRF’s volu-
metric rendering, converting SDF values into volume densities to maintain geometric accuracy. SDF
values are converted to opacities using a logistic function αi = max

GSDF: Dual-branch for Rendering and Reconstruction

To bridge the gap between rendering and geometric accuracy, we propose a novel approach that
combines the strengths of Gaussian-based and SDF-based methods. By leveraging the high-quality
rendering capabilities of 3DGS and the precise geometric representation of SDFs, our method aims
to achieve superior results in both tasks.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, our dual-branch design integrates a GS-branch and an SDF-branch. We use
Scaffold-GS [21] and NeuS [31] with adapted hash-encoding implementation [11] as the backbones,
chosen for their effectiveness and simplicity. Importantly, our framework is versatile and can be
easily adapted to incorporate future advanced methods for each branch.

3.2.1
GS →SDF: Depth Guided Ray Sampling

To address the computational expenses of ray-sampling, techniques such as hierarchical sampling [23],
occupancy grids [20, 4, 24], early stopping [24], and proposal networks [3, 26] are widely used with
CUDA accelerations. When depth maps are available, either from sensors or monocular estimation,
samples can be strategically placed around surface regions, which is crucial for effective optimization
of the Signed Distance Field (SDF). Unlike neural implicit SDF-based methods that rely on their own
predicted SDF values for ray sampling [31, 19, 28], we employ the GS-branch to provide surface
proximity, avoiding the chicken-and-egg dilemma. Inspired by [37], where a more efficient branch
provides coarse geometry guidance, we leverage depth maps from the GS-branch to refine the ray
sampling range for the SDF-branch. While Gaussian primitives may be less precise, they are efficient
and flexible, offering sufficient geometric clues without significant overhead.

Concretely, for a ray emitted from a camera center ⃗o in the direction ⃗v, the depth value D from the
GS-branch is:

D =
X

i∈N
diσi

i−1
Y

j=1
(1 −σj),
(1)

where N is the number of 3D Gaussians encountered, σi is the opacity, and di is the distance from
the i-th Gaussian to the camera. For SDF-branch optimization, points are sampled around ⃗o + D · ⃗v.
The sampling range adapts based on predicted SDF values s at various depths:

s = Fs(⃗o + D · ⃗v),
(2)

where Fs is a two-layer MLP predicting the SDF value at a given position. The sampling range is
defined as r = [⃗o + (D −k|s|) · ⃗v,⃗o + (D + k|s|) · ⃗v]. As shown in Fig. 2, inspired from NeRF’s

---Page Break---
hierarchical sampling strategy [23], we use coarse and fine ranges with k = 3 and k = 1, respectively,
we uniformly sample M points along the ray within each range.

3.2.2
SDF →GS: Geometry-aware Gaussian Density Control

Many previous and concurrent methods [13, 10, 7] have attempted to learn scene surfaces from
3DGS by flattening 3D Gaussians along the normal direction and enforcing nearly binary opacity,
treating them like surface primitives similar to mesh triangles. However, this approach often leads
to degraded rendering quality and incomplete surfaces. Our approach, instead of putting additional
regularization on the 3D Gaussian primitives, enhances the distribution of Gaussian primitives using
a geometry-aware density control strategy. Building on the original gradient-based density control,
we leverage the zero-level set of the SDF-branch to determine the proximity of Gaussian primitives
to the surface. By querying the SDF-branch with the positions of Gaussian primitives, we are able to
identify close-to-surface Gaussian primitives (i.e. with smaller absolute SDF values), allowing for
more precise control over the placement and density of Gaussians.

Growing Operator. For each Gaussian primitive at position c, we obtain its SDF value s = Fs(c)
from the SDF-branch. The growth criteria for Gaussians are then defined as:

ϵg = ∇g + ωgµ(s),
(3)

where ∇g is the averaged gradient of Gaussian primitives accumulated over K training iterations,
as in Scaffold-GS [21]. µ(s) = exp
 
−s2/(2σ2)

is a Gaussian function converting the SDF value
to a positive factor, decreasing monotonically with distance from the zero level set. ωg controls
the influence of geometric guidance. New Gaussian primitives are added if ϵg are greater than a
predefined τg.

Pruning Operator. Beyond the original opacity-based criteria, we prune Gaussian primitives far
from the surface, indicated by large SDF values. The pruning criteria are:

ϵp = σa −ωp(1 −µ(s)),
(4)

where σa is the aggregated opacity over K iterations. The weight ωp balances the contributions of
transparency and SDF. Primitives with ϵp less than a predefined τp are pruned.

3.2.3
GS ↔SDF: Mutual Geometry Supervision

To enhance both rendering and reconstruction outcomes, our framework incorporates mutual supervi-
sion between the two branches, using depth and normal maps as key geometric features to facilitate
this interconnection.

For the SDF-branch, a per-view depth map Ds is rendered using volumetric rendering principles,
and a normal map Ns is derived by rendering the gradients of the SDF volumetrically. For the
GS-branch, we compute a per-view depth map Dg following Eq. 1. The normal of each 3D Gaussian
is determined by the direction of its smallest scaling factor, as in [10, 5, 6]. To render the normal
map for each camera view, we accumulate the normals of the 3D Gaussians using α-blending
Ng = P

i∈N niσi
Qi−1
j=1(1 −σj), where ni is the estimated normal of the i-th 3D Gaussian.

This mutual geometry supervision ensures that the depth and normal maps from both branches are
consistently aligned. This consistent alignment is crucial for maintaining coherence between the
rendering and reconstruction processes, as it helps to prevent discrepancies that could lead to artifacts
and inaccuracies when performing mutual guidance. This consistency is especially important for
achieving high-quality results in complex scenes, where precise geometric alignment can significantly
enhance the visual and structural integrity of the output.

3.3
Training Strategy and Loss Design

The GS-branch is supervised by rendering losses L1 and LSSIM, which measure the difference between
the rendered RGB images and ground truth images, and a volume regularization term Lvol as in [21].
The complete loss function for GS-branch is:

Lg = λ1L1 + (1 −λ1)LSSIM + λvolLvol,
(5)

5


---Page Break---
where λ1 and λvol are weighting coefficients. Similarly, the SDF-branch is supervised by the L1
rendering loss, supplemented with Eikonal and curvature penalties to ensure accurate geometry
reconstruction. The loss function for the SDF-branch is:

Ls = L1 + λeikLeik + λcurvLcurv,
(6)

where Leik represents the Eikonal loss, ensuring that the gradients of the predicted SDF field are
normalized, and Lcurv denotes the curvature loss, promoting surface smoothness as described in [19,
28]. The coefficients λeik and λcurv balance the influence of these loss terms.

The mutual geometry supervision includes depth and normal consistency losses applied to both
branches. For unbounded scenes with distant backgrounds, we only apply the mutual geometric
supervision to foreground regions, as these geometries are more reliable and of primary interest [11].
The mutual loss is formulated as:

Lmutual = λdLd + λnLn = λd∥Dgs −Ds∥+ λn


1 −|Ngs · Ns|

∥Ngs∥∥Ns∥


,
(7)

where Ld and Ln represent the depth and normal discrepancies between the two branches, and λd
and λn balance their importance. Finally, the total loss for joint learning is defined as:

L = Lg + Ls + Lmutual.
(8)

The hyper-parameter settings are detailed in the supplementary material.

Experimental Setup

Datasets. We evaluated results using 26 real-world and synthetic scenes from various datasets: 7 from
Mip-NeRF360 [3], 2 from DeepBlending [12], 2 from Tanks&Temples [18], and 15 from DTU [14],
featuring a wide range of indoor, outdoor, and object-centric scenarios.

Implementation Details. We implemented our dual-branch model based on 1) Scaffold-GS [21] and
2) an enhanced version of NeuS [31] with a hash-grid variant [11], following the practice of [19]. The
hash grid resolution spans from 25 to 211 with 16 levels, each entry having a feature dimension of 4
and a maximum of 221 entries per level. The coarsest 4 layers were activated initially for the DTU [1],
and 8 layers for other datasets, with finer levels added every 2k iterations. We trained the GS-branch
for 15k iterations, followed by joint training of both branches for 30k iterations. The SDF-branch was
warmed up for 2k iterations on the DTU and 5k on other datasets without depth-guided ray sampling.
Note that our system is adaptable with various existing or future rendering and reconstruction models.

Evaluations. We evaluated our method against state-of-the-art rendering and reconstruction ap-
proaches. For rendering comparison, we compared with Scaffold-GS [21], 3D-GS [17], NeuS [31],
2D-GS [13], and SuGaR [10] using PSNR, SSIM [33], and LPIPS [42] for quantitative comparisons.
We trained 3D-GS and Scaffold-GS for 45k iterations to align with our configurations. For reconstruc-
tion, we compared with NeuS [31], Instant-NSR [11] (our representative SDF-branch), SuGaR [10]
and 2D-GS [13]. We use Chamfer distance for quantitative evaluation. For all datasets, we used 1/8
of the images as test sets and the other 7/8 as training sets. All experiments were conducted on a
single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G memory.

GS [21] show that GSDF consistently outperformed these methods across all four datasets, showcasing
improvements in all metrics. Notably, the prominent improvements in the LPIPS metric indicate
that our method effectively captures high-frequency scene details and renders perceptually superior
results compared to baselines.

Enchanced Detail and Fidelity. Notably, our method excelled in achieving high rendering quality in
texture-less areas, as showcased in Fig.3, which is aligned with our design motivation for geometry-
aware density control. Specifically, in texture-less areas where vanilla 3D Gaussians struggled due to
small accumulated gradients, our method overcame this limitation by growing anchors in surface
regions which brings enhanced accuracy and scene details.

Robustness with Noisy Gaussians. To test the robustness, we experimented with randomly initialized
Gaussian primitives on 2D-GS, Scaffold-GS, and our method. Quantitative results in Table 2 highlight
the advantages of our geometric guidance, demonstrating superior performance and stability even
with random input. Further visual results are provided in the supplementary material.

Reconstruction Comparisons

We quantitatively evaluated the reconstruction ability on the DTU dataset, where our method achieved
the best Chamfer distance as shown in Table 1.

Enhanced Geometry Accuracy and Completeness. As illustrated in Fig.4, our method reconstructed
more complete and detailed meshes compared to baseline methods. Our approach effectively bypassed
local minima, preventing holes in the meshes. Notably, our method outperformed Instant-NSR,
delivering smooth, continuous meshes with well-preserved high-frequency details. In contrast,
meshes extracted from SuGaR [10] were non-manifold with broken topological relationships. 2D-
GS [13] extracts mesh from fused depth, which leads to over-smooth geometry.

Accerelated Convergence and Rendering. Benefited from the GS-branch, our method optimized
the SDF field significantly faster in terms of training iterations than previous methods with accurate
sample placements, which often required slow and exhaustive training and rendering. For instance,
NeuS [31] required about 8 hours of optimization on a single GPU for the DTU dataset, whereas our
method achieved comparable or better results within just 2 hours on a single GPU.

4.3
Ablation Studies

In this section, we examine the effectiveness of each individual module. Quantitative metrics and
qualitative visualizations are provided in Table 3 and Fig. 5.

Depth-Guided Ray Sampling. To evaluate the effectiveness of our depth-guided ray sampling
detailed in Sec 3.2, we conducted an ablation on depth-guided ray sampling using the original
stratified ray sampling approach [23]. The results show that this ablated setting produced overly
smoothed surfaces, failing to capture finer geometry details such as the heater and doors (Fig. 5,
column 2, patches 2 & 3). The resulting less accurate SDF also impacted rendering quality, making
details like the sticker on the wall appear more blurred compared to our full model.

Geometry-aware Gaussian Density Control. We replaced our geometry-aware Gaussian density
control with the pruning and growing strategy from Scaffold-GS [21] to evaluate its efficacy. As
shown in Fig. 5 (3rd column), this change led to missed details like the sticker on the wall (patch
4) due to small accumulated gradients on the texture-less surface. The reconstruction results also
showed the absence of thin objects such as table legs and the chandelier (patch 1), highlighting the
limitations of the vanilla strategy.

Mutual Geometric Supervision. Lastly, we ablated the proposed mutual geometric supervision by
setting both λd and λn to 0 (Eq. 7). This resulted in a significant decay in surface quality and omission
of details in rendering. These findings indicate that neural rendering is more tolerant of deviations
than neural surface reconstruction. Without explicitly aligning Gaussians with SDF-derived geometry
during optimization, the two branches can diverge, leading to sub-optimal results for both.

4.4
Limitations and Future Works

Currently, our method is not tailored to handle challenging scenes with reflections and intense
lighting variations, such as those found in indoor environments. However, we have observed that
employing more structured and surface-aligned Gaussian primitives holds promise in capturing
such view-dependent appearance changes with improved scene geometry. Our framework requires
more memory usage because it simultaneously considers two representations. Furthermore, the
performance of our SDF-branch significantly lags behind the GS-branch, leading to extended training
durations compared to Scaffold-GS [21] only. Hence, improving the efficiency of the MLP-based

SDF-branch is a crucial direction for future research. Still, training time is not the highest priority
compared to inference, where primitives are stored and can be accessed efficiently.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduced a dual-branch framework that leverages the strengths of both 3D-GS
and SDF, showcasing its potential to achieve both enhanced rendering and reconstruction quality.
The inherent differences in two representations, rendering approaches, and supervision loss pose a
challenge to the seamless integration. We therefore integrate a bidirectional mutual guidance approach
during the training to circumvent these restrictions. Three types of guidance have been introduced
and validated in our framework, namely: 1) depth guided sampling (GS→SDF), 2) geometry-
aware Gaussian density control (SDF→GS); and 3) mutual geometry supervision (GS↔SDF). Our
extensive results demonstrate the efficiency and joint performance improvement on both tasks. As
the two branches maintain their original architectures, we keep their efficiency during inference,
allowing room for potential enhancements by substituting each branch with more advanced models
in the future. We envision our model benefiting applications demanding high-quality rendering and
geometry, including embodied environments, physical simulation, and immersive VR experiences.

Supplementary Material

The following sections are organized as follows: 1) The first section elaborates on the implementa-
tion details of GSDF, covering hyper-parameters and curvature loss. 2) We then show additional
experimental results. 3) Lastly, we also delve into limitations and future directions. More results and
video demos can be found in supplementary webpage.

A.1
Implementation details

A.1.1
Configurations.

Below, we enumerate the hyper-parameters used in our experiments:

• The variance σ2 for the Gaussian function in Eq. 3 and 4 is set to 0.005.
• For the rendering loss discussed in Sec. 3.3, we set λ1 = 0.2 and λvol = 0.01, in consistency
with the configurations specified in Scaffold-GS [21].
• For the SDF-branch, we set λeik = 0.1 and implement an adaptive scheme for λcurv.
Specifically, λcurv increases linearly from 0 to 1 (0.5 on DTU) over the first 2000 iterations,
after which it remains at 0.05 (0.01 on DTU) for subsequent iterations. This strategy is based
on our observation that increasing the weight of the curvature loss significantly encourages
the convergence of the SDF to a geometric outline.
• For the mutual geometry loss, we typically assign λd = 0.5 and λn = 0.01.

A.1.2
Curvature Loss.

While Instant-NSR [11] derives the curvature loss from a discrete Laplacian, we follow a more robust
and explicit method as described in PermutoSDF [28]. For any given point, we randomly perturb it
within the tangent plane orthogonal to its normal. The curvature loss is then measured by the cosine
similarity of normals between the original point and its perturbed counterpart. Note that, we applied
the same curvature loss for both Instant-NSR and GSDF.

A.2
More experiments

A.2.1
Reconstruction with 500k iterations.

As discussed in Sec. 4, optimizing the SDF is a time-intensive process. While our GS-branch assists
in the convergence of the SDF-branch, we conjecture that further improvements could be made
through additional iterations. Hence, we train our method for 500k iterations. As shown in Fig.6, our
method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to Instant-NSR [11] (our SDF-branch)
with the same training iterations.

A.2.2
Rendering comparison with random initialization.

In Sec. 3.2, we discussed how the SDF-branch can improve the rendering quality of the GS-branch.
This enhancement is particularly noticeable when Gaussian primitives are randomly initialized, as
shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

A.2.3
Per-scene Results.

We list the per-scene quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance) used in our
rendering and reconstruction evaluation in Sec. 4 for all considered methods, as shown from Tab. 4 to
Tab. 6.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We introduce GSDF, a dual-branch structure combining the strengths of 3D-GS
and SDF, for improving both rendering and reconstruction. Please see our abstract and
introduction for further details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our framework still struggles with the dilemma like most SDF-based recon-
struction methods. Please see the limitation section (Sec. 4.4) for further details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the method and experiment sections, we provide a detailed discussion and
substantial evidence to demonstrate each result.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: GSDF is a robust framework that comprises a GS-branch dedicated to rendering
and an SDF-branch focusing on learning neural surfaces. By leveraging the mutual guidance
between these two branches, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
rendering and reconstruction tasks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

19


---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We will release the code after acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the Experimental Setup section (Sec. 4.1) and Implementation details section
(Sec. A.1), we provide comprehensive details, including the data splits and hyperparameters
used in our experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The experimental result for redering and reconstruction tasks from dense
views are very stable, the standard deviation is negligible, so we follow the previous work’s
practice and not report the error bar.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Experiment section (Sec. 4), We provide sufficient information on the
computer resources, including the type of compute workers GPU and training time.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and are committed to
strictly adhering to its guidelines.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Neural rendering and surface reconstruction are crucial tasks with important
downstream applications in areas like robotics, physical simulations, and augmented reality.
We believe our GSDF system has the potential to advance progress in this domain and
support the development of these applications.

21


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no such risks in the rendering and reconstruction tasks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the Experimental Setup section (Sec. 4.1), we cite each used code package
and public datasets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

22


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We plan to release the code upon acceptance of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve any crowdsourcing or research with human
subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve any crowdsourcing or research with human
subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

23


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
