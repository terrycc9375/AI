existing 3D detectors and our OneDet3D. These models are jointly training on the indoor datasets
SUN RGB-D (SUN), ScanNet, and outdoor datasets KITTI, nuScenes (nuS). We also evaluate the
cross-domain performance on the indoor S3DIS and outdoor Waymo datasets. The center of the

indoor detectors are plotted in red, outdoor detectors are in green, and detectors that aim for different

diverse 3D scenes (a larger polygon area) with only one set of parameters and the same architecture.

Abstract

The current trend in computer vision is to utilize one universal model to address all
various tasks. Achieving such a universal model inevitably requires incorporating
multi-domain data for joint training to learn across multiple problem scenarios. In
point cloud based 3D object detection, however, such multi-domain joint training is
highly challenging, because large domain gaps among point clouds from different
datasets lead to the severe domain-interference problem. In this paper, we pro-
pose OneDet3D, a universal one-for-all model that addresses 3D detection across
different domains, including diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, within the same
framework and only one set of parameters. We propose the domain-aware parti-
tioning in scatter and context, guided by a routing mechanism, to address the data
interference issue, and further incorporate the text modality for a language-guided
classification to unify the multi-dataset label spaces and mitigate the category inter-
ference issue. The fully sparse structure and anchor-free head further accommodate
point clouds with significant scale disparities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the strong universal ability of OneDet3D to utilize only one trained model for
addressing almost all 3D object detection tasks (Fig. 1).

training on multi-domain point cloud data.

3D point cloud based object detec-
tion aims to predict the oriented 3D
bounding boxes and the correspond-
ing semantic category tags for the
real scenes given a point set. Unlike
mature 2D detectors [29, 14, 38, 4],
which once trained, can generally con-
duct inference on different types of
images in various scenes and envi-
ronments, current 3D detectors still
follow a single-dataset training-and-
testing paradigm, i.e., point clouds
used during inference should be from
the totally same domain as that used
during training. Whether indoor [25,
51, 44, 39] or outdoor [45, 16, 35, 32],
existing point cloud based 3D detectors can only be trained on datasets from one specific domain, then
be tested on the same domain data. Such restriction of training and testing on a single dataset severely
hampers the generalization ability of 3D detectors, resulting in a significant lag in the progress of 3D
detection compared to 2D in terms of universality.

To address this issue, multi-domain joint training (i.e., multi-dataset joint training) should be intro-
duced into point cloud based 3D object detection, to allow 3D detectors to learn from point clouds of
different domains through large-scale joint training. In this way, a 3D detector, once trained, can well
generalize across various domains of point clouds. The ultimate goal is to obtain a 3D detector that
can support unified 3D object detection across different domains with only one set of parameters,
thereby achieving the target of universal 3D object detection.

The motivation of multi-domain joint training is to learn universal 3D knowledge by leveraging point
clouds from different sources and domains, thereby establishing a general representation from 3D
data to 3D spatial positions. Through this, a model independent of point cloud source, collection, and
domain can be achieved. With common 3D knowledge from diverse point clouds, it can effectively
serve as a universal 3D detector and function as a 3D foundation model. However, achieving this
is highly challenging and difficult. As can be seen in Fig. 1, due to the significant domain gaps
(e.g., point cloud ranges, scenes, object sizes, sparsity, etc.), existing 3D detectors fail to support this.
Specifically, current 3D detectors can be generally divided into point-based and voxel-based ones.
For point-based 3D detectors (the upper part of Fig. 2a) [25, 51, 21], it is difficult to apply the same
sampling and grouping technique for different domain data. For voxel-based 3D detectors (the lower
part of Fig. 2a) [45, 47, 17, 41], which usually require converting from sparse to dense features for
3D box prediction, the scale differences between indoor and outdoor point clouds make it difficult to
represent them using dense features of the same size. This consequently limits existing models to
learning domain-specific knowledge, restricting their ability to acquire generalized 3D knowledge.

In this paper, we propose OneDet3D, a unified point cloud based 3D detector with only one set of
parameters through multi-domain joint training. As in Fig. 2b, we employ 3D sparse convolution for
feature extraction, which is more robust to domain gaps compared to point-based feature extractors [26,
27], making it well-suited for adapting to point clouds from different domains. Subsequently, we
utilize an anchor-free detection head, where objects are represented by center points [38, 47, 30],
enabling direct compatibility with sparse convolution and avoiding the constraints of fixed-size dense
features. Such a fully sparse structure, together with the anchor-free detection head using center point
representation, provides an effective architecture for multi-domain joint training.

Based on the model architecture, during multi-domain joint training, the domain-interference issue
should be further addressed. This issue primarily comprises two aspects: data-level interference
caused by differences in point clouds themselves, and category-level interference caused by label
conflict among categories across different domains. To mitigate the data-level interference, we
employ domain-aware partitioning, which partitions parameters where the interference problem
mainly exists to be domain-specific and keeps the vast majority shared among different domains. The
data-level interference can thus be effectively prevented without increasing the model complexity

too much. Specifically, we partition re-scaling in normalization layers to maintain the consistency of
the data scatter, and parameters about context learning for reducing the effect of range disparities.
They are guided by a domain router implemented by a domain classifier. To alleviate category-level
interference, we employ language-guided classification, leveraging the text modality to alleviate
conflict issues. We utilize a combination of fully connected layers and sparse convolution for
class-specific and class-agnostic classification to ensure compatibility with the anchor-free head.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We propose OneDet3D, a multi-domain point cloud joint training model for universal 3D object
detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3D detector that supports point clouds
from domains in both indoor and outdoor simultaneously with only one set of parameters.
• We propose the domain-aware partitioning in scatter and global context, guided by the domain
routing mechanism. In this way, the data-level interference issue caused by point cloud disparities
can be alleviated during multi-dataset joint training.
• We integrate the text modality into the anchor-free head classification. Through employing both
fully connected layers and 3D sparse convolution for the dual-level of class-agnostic and class-
specific classification, the issue of category-level interference can be mitigated.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the one-for-all ability of our OneDet3D. OneDet3D possesses the
strong generalization ability in both category and scene, thus effectively achieving the goal of universal
3D object detection. In the close-vocabulary setting, it achieves comparable performance using only
one set of parameters. In the open-vocabulary setting, it obtains more than 7% performance.

Related Work

3D object detection aims to predict category tags and oriented 3D bounding boxes for the scene. We
primarily discuss methods where point clouds serve as the input. Current 3D detectors can be generally
categorized into point-based and voxel-based methods. Point-based methods [25, 51, 21, 34] usually
extract point-wise features, then perform clustering and classification for detection. Voxel-based
methods [30, 39, 32, 9, 31, 47, 33] usually extract voxel-wise features using 3D sparse convolution,
then convert them into dense 3D features for 3D box prediction. Considering the disparities in point
clouds, existing 3D detection methods are also separated into indoor 3D detectors [25, 51, 30, 39]
and outdoor ones [45, 35, 32, 9, 31, 5, 33], where totally different model architectures are utilized
for each. Recently, [41] proposes a unified model architecture for both indoor and outdoor 3D
detection. However, these methods still follow a single-dataset training-and-testing paradigm, and
cannot address 3D detection for point clouds from various domains with one set of parameters.

Multi-dataset training aims to involve multiple datasets from various domains in training, so that
the model can generalize in multi-domain data at the inference time. Since RGB images mainly differ
in content, while the structural differences in images themselves are not significant, multi-dataset
training has been widely studied in the field of 2D object detection [40, 52, 55, 24, 42]. In comparison,
substantial differences inherently exist in the point clouds themselves, making multi-dataset training
more challenging in the 3D object detection task. Some recent works [48, 43, 46] have studied
this problem. However, they only address multi-dataset training within either indoor or outdoor
scenes and cannot handle multiple datasets simultaneously from both indoor and outdoor scenes.
For example, [40] and [12] deal with multi-dataset training with RGB images, [20] and [48] focus
on outdoor-only multi-dataset training, where the discrepancies between different datasets are far
less than those between indoor and outdoor point clouds. OneDet3D demonstrates that despite these
substantial differences, 3D detection can still be addressed with a universal solution. This is a crucial
advancement for generalization in the 3D domain.

Preliminary

Given a point cloud x, 3D object detection aims to predict its label y, which consists of the category
tags and 3D bounding boxes. Multi-domain (i.e., multi-dataset) data are utilized during training.
Denote the domain as D and the total number of domains as N, the total training data can thus be
denoted as D = {Dn = {(x(n), y(n))}}N
n=1. The purpose of multi-domain joint training is to train a
unified model from all these domains, which can obtain the minimum prediction error on all different
domains D. The obtained 3D detector should also generalize well on new domains.

In 3D object detection, the following two-level interference exists among different domain point
clouds, making multi-domain joint training highly challenging:

Data-level interference. As in Tab. 1, it can be observed that sensors for collecting indoor and
outdoor point clouds exhibit fundamental differences, resulting in significant disparities in the range
covered by the point clouds, with differences exceeding 10 to nearly 20 times. This also leads
to substantial differences in object sizes and sparsity within the scenes. Because of such scale
differences, it is challenging to utilize the same point-wise clustering technique or feature map with
the fixed size during joint training for point clouds from different scenes. Even among datasets that
belong to the same category of indoor or outdoor point clouds, there are still slight differences in the
sensors used for collection. For instance, SUN RGB-D [36] points are from RGB-D camera captures,
while ScanNet points are reconstructed from RGB images. Distinction in the number of LiDAR
beams also leads to differences in point cloud sparsity. We thus propose domain-aware partitioning in
section 4.2, guided by the routing technique, to alleviate such data-level interference.

Category-level interference. Different datasets typically possess distinct label spaces. An object
classified as background in one dataset might be considered as foreground in another. Even for
the same category, different datasets sometimes employ different classification and definition ways,
such as the definition of the “car” category in outdoor datasets. Such dataset-specific taxonomy and
annotation inconsistencies pose challenges in unifying multiple label spaces. The category-level
differences thus result in the interference problem among multiple datasets during training. We
propose the language-guided classification in section 4.3 to mitigate such category-level interference.

Method

The overview of our OneDet3D is illustrated in Fig. 3. We utilize 3D sparse convolution for feature
extraction and anchor-free detection head for 3D box prediction. Based on it, we propose the domain-
aware partitioning during feature extraction to alleviate data-level interference, and propose the
language-guided classification in the anchor-free head to mitigate category-level interference.

4.1
Multi-Domain Joint Training

Architecture. We design the architecture of OneDet3D from the feature extractor and the detection
head aspects. For the feature extractor, we utilize 3D sparse convolution to extract voxel-wise features.
Compared to point-wise structures, voxel-wise features are more robust to domain gaps and less
sensitive to hyper-parameters, suitable for multi-domain training. Additionally, sparse convolution is
not only computationally efficient but also operates solely on points, thus not relying on fixed-size
feature maps. This enables to extract domain-invariant 3D features for multi-domain joint training.

For the detection head, we adopt the anchor-free way, where objects are represented by their center
points. It directly regards points from sparse convolutions as centers to represent objects, avoiding the
need for conversion from sparse to dense feature maps. We do not employ any pruning layers [13, 30].
Instead, we retain all points until the final stage for box prediction. This helps avoid the issue of
requiring different pruning strategies due to variations in point clouds. Such a fully sparse architecture
well accommodates point clouds from multiple domains thus serves for multi-domain training.

Joint training. During training, due to the disparities in object sizes across different point clouds,
the localization accuracy requirements vary greatly among datasets. Considering this, besides
classification, regression, and centerness prediction learning, we also introduce the 3D IoU prediction
learning to ensure that the box scores accurately represent their positional accuracy.

Figure 3: The overview of OneDet3D. It utilizes multi-domain point clouds for training. The
domain-aware partitioning in scatter and context avoids the data-level interference issue, and the
language-guided classification addresses the issue from category-level interference. Once trained,
OneDet3D has the one-for-all ability to generalize to unseen domains, categories, and diverse scenes.

For classification, we use soft focal loss as in [41]. For easier optimization, we utilize the IoU in the
BEV space, IoUBEV , as the soft target. Specifically, denote the binary target class label as c, the
predicted class probability as ˆp, the classification loss is:

Lcls = −ˆαt · |c · IoUBEV −ˆp|ξ · log(|1 −c −ˆp|)
(1)

where ˆαt = α·c·IoUBEV +(1−α)·(1−c·IoUBEV ). This classification loss can be viewed as using
the soft target IoUBEV in focal loss [19]. By employing IoUBEV , the network classification focuses
solely on the position on the horizontal plane, which helps improve the calibration of classification
scores. Here, we discard positional information in the height direction to prevent optimization from
becoming overly complex, which makes the network easier to converge during joint training.

For regression, we use the 3D IoU loss [53], optimizing with the usual 3D IoU. For both centerness
and IoU prediction, we utilize the binary cross entropy loss. The IoU prediction branch is also
supervised with the usual 3D IoU. Since different datasets vary in scale, we employ dataset-aware
sampling during joint training: sampling datasets first and then randomly selecting samples. Denote
network parameters as θ, the objective of network training can thus be formulated as:

4.2
Domain-Aware Partitioning

During multi-domain joint training, we first aim to mitigate the data-level interference caused by
differences in the inherent structure of point clouds. We identify two primary sources of interference.
First, due to significant differences between data, interference mainly arises in the normalization
layers, which adjust the scatter of data to maintain their consistency. Second, convolution mainly
focuses on local information, leading to interference in context learning across different domain point
clouds, where scale difference mainly exists. Therefore, we partition parameters about these two
aspects into domain-specific ones. We design a domain router to guide such domain-aware training.
In this way, the partitioned parameters are responsible for learning domain-equivalent knowledge,
while the majority of the model can avoid interference and learn domain-invariant 3D knowledge.
This allows multi-domain joint training to effectively acquire universal 3D representations.

Domain router. Given the input point cloud x(n), the domain router aims to guide its path for the
domain-aware partitioning. We utilize a domain classifier for the routing mechanism by classifying
its correct domain label n. To achieve this, we employ 3D sparse convolutions with kernel sizes of 3
and 1 for simple feature extraction, then utilize global average pooling (GAP) to obtain the feature of
the whole scene. After applying softmax, we obtain the domain probability {p(n)
d }N
n=1 and directly
use cross entropy loss for classification. Due to the large domain differences, this classification task is
relatively simple thus the domain router can converge rapidly. During inference, when encountering
unseen domain data, such domain probability can indicate its similarity to seen domains and provide
its data flowing path, enabling the model to generalize to unseen domains.

Scatter partitioning. The normalization layers conduct regularization for input data, thus reducing
hierarchical differences in data and making the network easier to train. Then normalization layers
conduct re-scaling to adjust the scatter of data. Considering the significant differences in different
domains, the same re-scaling operations will lead to disparities in the output data scatters. In this
situation, we partition scaling and shifting parameters after normalization for each domain data, so
that data scatter in different domains can be partitioned. All other convolution layers can be shared,
only scaling and shifting parameters being domain-specific and differing. For unseen domains at the
inference time, we introduce the domain probability from the domain router. Specifically, we keep
N sets of scaling and shifting parameters {γ(n)}N
n=1, {β(n)}N
n=1. Scatter partitioning can thus be
formulated as:

x =

N
X

n=1
p(n)
d
·

"
x −E(x)
p

Var(x) + ϵ
· γ(n) + β(n)
#

(3)

where we utilize x to denote the output of normalization layers. Through this, the network can apply
individualized re-scaling operations from different domains, resulting in domain-specific scatter thus
effectively mitigating the data-level interference. Only introducing N sets of scaling and shifting
parameters almost negligibly increases the model size.

Context partitioning. In addition, we separately learn global context information for different
domain data to prevent interference between them in terms of global context. Specifically, for features
f from the blocks in the feature extractor, we first apply a global average pooling layer to extract
the feature of the whole scene, then utilize a 3D sparse convolution to learn its context information.
According to previous work [41], global information mainly matters in indoor scenes. We thus
only impose context learning for indoor domains. The process of context partitioning can thus be
formulated as:
ˆf = f +
X

i∈indoor
p(i)
d · conv(i)(GAP(f))
(4)

where we utilize ˆf to denote the updated features with partitioned domain-aware global context.

4.3
Language-Guided Classification

We then aim to alleviate category-level interference among domains caused by label conflicts.
Different datasets inherently possess different label spaces, which leads to the problem of annotation
inconsistency. Moreover, at the inference time, unseen domains may involve a label space that
is different from those seen during training. Such a category-level difference results in different
definitions of the same object, leading to the conflict and interference problems during training.
To address this, we utilize language vocabulary embeddings from CLIP [28] for classification.
Specifically, we use the prompt "a photo of {name}" to extract language embeddings of the category
names from different datasets using CLIP. These language embeddings are then used as parameters
of the fully connected layer to perform the final classification, and are kept frozen during training.
Each dataset utilizes its own language embeddings, effectively mitigating such interference.

Due to the fully convolution architecture and the anchor-free head, the final classification is typically
achieved through 3D sparse convolutions. To incorporate language embeddings, we convert the sparse
features of points into dense features, and then use language embeddings for classification through
fully connected layers. However, this conversion from sparse to dense features, together with the
frozen language embeddings, poses obstacles to gradient backpropagation, making it difficult for the
network to converge. To address this, we introduce a class-agnostic classification branch that performs
only foreground-background binary classification. This branch is shared across different datasets
and implemented using 3D sparse convolution. In this way, a part of classification can be addressed
through 3D sparse convolution, making it easier to converge. The classification probabilities from
both branches are multiplied finally. The utilization of such shared class-agnostic classification across
domains also facilitates the model in learning general category knowledge in the 3D domain.

Open-vocabulary extension. Introducing language embeddings into classification enables our
OneDet3D to be easily extended to the open-vocabulary setting, benefiting from the generalization
ability of text to unseen categories. To further ensure category scalability, we follow [23] by first
performing large-scale vocabulary inference on 2D images using a pre-trained 2D open-vocabulary
detector [54], then projecting the obtained 2D boxes into 3D space to obtain 3D pseudo labels with an
expanded vocabulary. With such large-vocabulary pseudo labels for multi-domain joint training, the

generalization ability to novel categories can be boosted. The multi-dataset training manner makes it
possible to comprehensively utilize different types of data from various domains, thus is quite suitable
for the open-vocabulary setting. Through such open-vocabulary extension, OneDet3D can generalize
to unseen categories. As a result, OneDet3D can generalize across various domains, categories, and
scenes, thus can be considered to possess the capability of universal 3D object detection.

Experiments

In this section, we demonstrate the one-for-all ability of our OneDet3D through extensive experiments.
Close-vocabulary and open-vocabulary 3D object detection experiments are both conducted. We
mainly conduct multi-dataset joint training on SUN RGB-D [36], ScanNet [8], KITTI [11], and
nuScenes [2] datasets, and utilize S3DIS [1] and Waymo [37] for unseen domains in cross-dataset
experiments. We implement OneDet3D with mmdetection3D [7], and train it with the AdamW [22]
optimizer. We use the 0.01m voxel size for indoor datasets and the 0.05m voxel size for outdoor
ones. Besides this, other architecture-related hyper-parameters are all the same for different datasets.
During multi-dataset training, the attribute channel size is set to the least common multiple of the
attribute dimensions from the different datasets, which is 6-dim. The attributes of the point clouds
from different datasets are repeated accordingly to match this unified channel size.

5.1
Closed-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection

We first conduct multi-dataset joint training on all the above mentioned four datasets, and perform
closed-vocabulary inference. Specifically, for the SUN RGB-D dataset, we perform 3D detection
on 10 classes, for ScanNet it’s 18 classes, while for the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, we focus on
the performance of the “car” category. The results are listed in Tab. 2. It can be seen that even in
the traditional single-dataset training-and-testing paradigm, existing 3D detectors can only conduct
detection in a specific domain. Indoor 3D detectors can only operate on indoor point clouds, while the
majority of existing outdoor 3D detectors can only work on one of the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
because of their differences in sparsity and scenes. In comparison, our model can directly perform
training and inference on these different domain point clouds. After multi-dataset joint training,
OneDet3D can perform 3D detection on all domain point clouds with only one set of parameters.
The performance surpasses that of most existing methods trained and tested using single-dataset
training and inference. For instance, on the SUN RGB-D dataset, OneDet3D achieves the 65.0%

AP25, surpassing FCAF3D by 1.2%. On the outdoor KITTI dataset, OneDet3D performs comparably
to PV-RCNN, and on nuScenes, its AP surpasses existing methods such as VoxelNeXt and UVTR.
Moreover, after multi-domain joint training, the performance of OneDet3D exceeds its own from
single-dataset training. On the SUN RGB-D and KITTI datasets, multi-dataset joint training brings
a 1.8% improvement for both. This demonstrates that even with significant differences, OneDet3D
can learn universal 3D detection knowledge from these diverse point clouds. The necessity of
multi-domain joint training and the effectiveness of our OneDet3D can thus be demonstrated.

Comparison with more recent methods.
We further compare with some more recent
3D detectors and list the comparison in Tab. 3.
As can be seen, these recent methods target
at specific 3D scenes. They may outperform
OneDet3D in those particular datasets, but
AP tends to drop when the scene changes, es-
pecially when switching from outdoor to in-
door. After multi-dataset training, due to the
dataset-aware interference, AP on all datasets
degrade severely. In such multi-dataset sce-
narios, OneDet3D still achieves the best. Be-
sides, compared with Uni3D [48], which has
provided a unified model for outdoor point
clouds, OneDet3D provides a universal so-
lution for all point clouds. As can be seen,
even compared with these recent methods,
OneDet3D is still the first universal 3D detec-
tor that can generalize across various point clouds. The main reason is that the specific designs of
these detection heads, such as vote-based methods or BEV detection, are influenced by the structure
and content of point clouds and thus are only applicable to outdoor scenes. Additionally, these
methods lack designs to address multi-dataset interference, resulting in performance degradation
across all datasets during multi-dataset joint training. In contrast, the anchor-free detection head of
our OneDet3D is more versatile for both indoor and outdoor scenes. Furthermore, domain-aware
partitioning and language-guided classification can alleviate multi-dataset interference. Therefore,
our approach provides a more universal solution for 3D detection.

We then conduct open-vocabulary 3D object detection experiments with our OneDet3D. In our
experiments, we refer to the setting in CoDA, where SUN RGB-D involves 46 classes and ScanNet
involves 60 classes in total. Their top 10 classes are used as base categories. For multi-dataset
joint training, we combine the base categories from both datasets to form a union, resulting in a
total of 16 base categories, with the rest as novel categories. We reproduce the results of existing
methods under this new category division and list the comparison in Tab. 4. It’s worth noting that for
a fair comparison, we used exactly the same setting as CoDA, which utilizes a single-view image
setting in ScanNet, slightly different from the above closed-vocabulary setting. It can be seen that
the superiority of our method is more obvious here. On the SUN RGB-D dataset, we achieve the
APnovel improvement of over 5.94% compared to CoDA. On the ScanNet dataset, we achieve the

15.52% APnovel, surpassing CoDA by even more than 9%. This strongly demonstrates that our
OneDet3D not only generalizes well across domains but also exhibits strong generalization ability at
the category level. Compared to single-dataset training, multi-dataset training brings the over 1%
improvement. This is because the utilization of multiple datasets enables to learn richer knowledge
about categories. This experiment validates the universal ability of OneDet3D in terms of categories,
which demonstrates its basic capability for universal 3D object detection.

5.3
Cross-Domain 3D Object Detection

We further conduct cross-domain 3D detection experiments, with S3DIS and Waymo as new domains
for inference. The comparison results are listed in Tab. 5 and Tab. 6. It can be observed that on
S3DIS, in single-dataset training, our method already outperforms existing methods. This is because
our language-guided classification better alleviates category conflicts. The performance is slightly
better when trained on ScanNet because the ScanNet domain is more similar to S3DIS. After training
on both datasets, the cross-domain AP on S3DIS improves by more than 4%, indicating the model
ability to integrate information from both domain datasets. Furthermore, with the introduction of two
outdoor datasets, AP25 improves by 0.9%, with AP50 remaining stable. This demonstrates that our
OneDet3D can learn from such highly different domain point clouds for enhancement in cross-domain
3D detection. In outdoor point clouds, this is even more pronounced. KITTI is relatively similar to
Waymo but only contains small-scale point clouds, while nuScenes is larger-scale but exhibits a larger
domain gap. Training separately on these two datasets thus only yields limited cross-dataset AP3D
on Waymo. In comparison, through multi-dataset training, the model can utilize the characteristics of
both, resulting in a substantial 23.1% improvement. This demonstrates the generalization capability
of our method to unseen domains and further validates the necessity of multi-dataset training.

5.4
Ablation Study

We finally conduct ablation study in this subsection and list the results in Tab. 7 to evaluate our
designs. Here we conduct multi-dataset training on the SUN RGB-D and KITTI datasets, and
utilize S3DIS here for cross-domain evaluation. We also list the single-dataset training results as a
reference. As can be seen, although our model architecture allows for multi-dataset joint training,
directly multi-dataset training results in decreased AP on both seen and unseen domains, because
of the interference problem. After introducing scatter partitioning, which alleviates interference
among multiple domains during regularization, the model performance essentially matches and
slightly exceeds that of single-dataset training. Then, through context partitioning, the detector can

selectively learn the corresponding global context of different domain point clouds, leading to further
AP improvement. Especially for the indoor domain, the partitioning of global context learning enables
multi-domain joint training AP to surpass those of single-domain training. Finally, with language-
guided classification, the effect of category conflict can be mitigated. Since the category conflict
problem between SUN RGB-D and KITTI is not severe, the performance improvement on these two
datasets is relatively moderate. The about 0.5% AP improvement here is primarily because of the
common class-agnostic classification. In cross-dataset experiments on S3DIS, language embeddings
contribute to a more AP increase, more than 2% improvement. This is mainly because of the more
substantial overlap in categories between SUN RGB-D and S3DIS, making language embeddings
more effective for these two domains. Such the ablation study thus demonstrates the necessity of
these designs to address the interference issues for multi-dataset joint training.

We provide visualized results from our OneDet3D in Fig. 4. It can be seen that no matter for indoor
or outdoor point clouds from different domains, OneDet3D can perform 3D detection effectively
using only one set of parameters. This further demonstrates its effectiveness and universal ability.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose OneDet3D, a universal point cloud based 3D object detector that can
generalize across various domains, categories, and scenes with only one set of parameters. The
fully sparse structure and the anchor-free detection head serve as the basic model architecture. With
partitioning in scatter and context, together with the language-guided classification, the interference
caused by point clouds and categories can be alleviated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong
one-for-all ability of OneDet3D. For the first time, we implement various scenarios and requirements
of 3D object detection within a unified framework. This demonstrates that our OneDet3D has learned
general 3D representations through multi-domain joint training, thus basically realizing the demands
of universal 3D object detection and 3D foundation models. We believe that our research will
stimulate following research along the universal computer vision direction in the future.

Appendix

In the appendix, we include more dataset introduction and implementation details. We also conduct
more ablation studies to illustrate the reasonableness of our designs. More visualized examples are
provided to further demonstrate the effectiveness of our OneDet3D.

A
Datasets and Implementation Details

SUN RGB-D [36]. SUN RGB-D is a single-view indoor dataset with 5,285 training and 5,050
validation scenes, annotated with 10 classes and oriented 3D bounding boxes. The point clouds
within it are from converting RGB-D camera results. We utilize the 0.01m grid size for voxelization.
During training, we randomly flip the input data along the x axis, randomly sample 10,000 points,
and apply global translation, rotation, scaling for data augmentation. We utilize the AP25 and AP50
metrics for evaluation.

ScanNet [8]. The ScanNet V2 dataset contains 1,201 reconstructed training scans and 312 validation
scans, with 18 object categories for axis-aligned bounding boxes. The point clouds within it are
from reconstructing from a series of multi-view images. We also utilize the 0.01m grid size for
voxelization. During training, we randomly flip the input data along both the x and y axis, randomly
sample 10,000 points, and apply global translation, rotation, scaling for data augmentation. We utilize
the AP25 and AP50 metrics for evaluation. For the open-vocabulary setting, we adopt the same setting
as CoDA [3], dividing the large panoramic scene from the original ScanNet V2 into several smaller
point cloud scenes, each corresponding to a single-view image. There are 47,841 training samples
and 4,886 validation samples ultimately for the open-vocabulary setting.

KITTI [11]. The KITTI dataset consists of 7,481 LiDAR samples for its official training set, and
we split it into 3,712 training samples and 3,769 validation samples for training and evaluation. We
only utilize the "car" category for training and evaluation. During training, we also adopt van class
objects as car objects. The data augmentation operations are basically the same as previous outdoor
3D detectors like [9]. For the ground-truth sampling augmentation, we sample at most 20 cars from
the database. 18000 points are randomly sampled at the training time. The predicted car objects are
filtered at the threshold of 0.6 after inference. We utilize the AP70 metric under 40 recall positions on
the "car" category for evaluation.

nuScenes [2]. Compared to the KITTI dataset, the nuScenes dataset covers a larger range, with 360
degrees around the LiDAR instead of only the front view. Its point clouds are also more sparse (with
32-beam LiDAR compared to the KITTI 64 beams). We train on the 28,130 frames of samples in
the training set and evaluate on the 6,010 validation samples. We do not predict the velocities or
attributes of objects, to keep consistent with other datasets. We only utilize the "car" category for
training and evaluation. For the ground-truth sampling augmentation, we sample at most 5 cars from
the database. We utilize its official AP metric, averaging over match thresholds of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 meters.
We also utilize the KITTI AP metric for evaluation.

S3DIS [1]. S3DIS consists of 3D scans from 6 buildings, 5 object classes annotated with axis-aligned
bounding boxes. We use the official split and perform cross-dataset evaluation of our method on 68
rooms from Area 5. Its point clouds are also from reconstructing multi-view images. We utilize the
AP25 and AP50 metrics for evaluation.

Waymo [37]. We utilize the Waymo dataset for cross-dataset evaluation. We evaluate on its 39,987
samples of its validation set. We also only evaluate on the "car" category (i.e., the "vehicle" category).
We utilize the KITTI metric, AP70 under 40 recall positions in both 3D and BEV, for evaluation.

Implementation details. We implement OneDet3D with mmdetection3D [7]. We utilize the 3D
sparse convolution based ResNet50 [15] as backbone, together with FPN [18] for feature extraction.
We train the model with the AdamW [22] optimizer for 20 epochs. The initial learning rate is set
to 0.0001 and is updated in the cyclic manner. Point clouds from different datasets are sampled
uniformly. We remove the ground-truth sampling augmentation at the last 2 epochs.

More Ablation Study

Context partitioning. We discuss the design details about partitioning the learning of global context
and list such ablation study in Tab. 8. As can be seen, without the partitioning, the model can already
achieve the performance through multi-dataset training that is better than the single-dataset training
baseline, partially due to our design of scatter partitioning. If we apply context partitioning for both
indoor and outdoor point clouds, the 3D detection AP decreases on all datasets. Especially for the
outdoor KITTI dataset, APm decreases by 3.8%. This is because global information in outdoor
scenes tends to be disruptive, given the excessive background points and the fact that foreground
objects occupy only a small portion of the scene. In comparison, introducing context partitioning
only for indoor point clouds can lead to a more than 1% AP improvement, and the cross-dataset
AP improvement is 2.5%. This is because indoor scenes are smaller and the object distribution is
more crowded, making global context relatively more important thus contributing to performance
improvement. Therefore, the rationality of our context partitioning design is validated.

Language-guided classification. We then discuss the design details about our language-guided
classification and list the related 3D detection results in Tab. 9. The anchor-free detection head
typically employs 3D sparse convolution for final classification. However, this approach struggles
to address the category conflict issue among different domains. Especially during cross-dataset
evaluation, differences in category definitions across datasets and the potential new categories in new
domains can all restrict the model performance. Utilizing language embeddings as the classification
layer can help mitigate this issue, due to the generalization ability of the text modality. However,
directly using CLIP embeddings for classification results in a decrease in detection AP across all
datasets. This is because a frozen fully connected layer impedes gradient backpropagation in the fully
sparse convolution structure. Instead, when CLIP embeddings are trainable instead of frozen, the
achieved AP can be comparable to or slightly surpass that of 3D sparse convolution. However, in this
way, CLIP embeddings are not available at the inference time, and the model thus cannot generalize
to new domains, especially new categories during inference.

In comparison, what we utilize is the combination of 3D sparse convolution and frozen CLIP
embeddings. 3D sparse convolution is utilized for class-agnostic classification, and is shared among
all domains. The frozen CLIP embeddings are utilized for class-specific classification, and can benefit
the model with the help of the text modality. As a result, both detection AP from the indoor and
outdoor domains can be boosted. The cross-dataset AP on S3DIS increases the most, a 2% AP25
improvement, because the category conflict problem can be alleviated. The effectiveness of our
designs in language-guided classification is thus demonstrated.

Classification loss. We then analyze the choice of the loss function for classification, and list the
comparative results in Tab. 10. It can be observed that if we utilize focal loss for classification, which
is widely utilized in the anchor-free detection head, the model cannot converge. This problem appears
after the introduction of the language-guided classification. Since the class-specific classification is
implemented by CLIP embeddings, which are frozen during training, the model requires a stronger
optimization way for learning. The usual used focal loss thus becomes insufficient in this task. Utiliz-
ing soft focal loss, with IoU as the soft target can introduce positional information in classification,
thus alleviating this problem. When using IoU3D as the soft target, as IoU3D is relatively hard to
optimize, especially coupled with the classification task, the performance is still limited. The use
of decoupled IoU proposed in [41] can alleviate this problem, by decoupling IoU calculation in
the xy plane and the z axis. However, this decoupling is still not enough in our task, because the
frozen CLIP embeddings make optimization more challenging. Therefore, we directly disregard the
z direction here, and utilize IoUBEV here. The positional information in the xy plane can already
provide sufficient supervision signals for classification, and disregarding the z direction also makes
optimization easier. Ultimately, the model can conduct supervised learning with the language-guided
classification, and achieve satisfying results on both indoor and outdoor point clouds.

obtains satisfying detection results on all these four datasets, with only one set of parameters. Our
method can accurately detect objects in various domain point clouds, ranging from indoor crowded

scenes with overlapping objects to outdoor scenes with small-sized objects. This further demonstrates
its effectiveness and universality.

Limitation and Potential Negative Social Impacts. Our approach addresses the multi-domain joint
training issue in point clouds, aiming to achieve a universal 3D detector. Currently, it focuses on
supervised learning. Its utilized point clouds should be fully-annotated, with both categories and 3D
boxes. In the future, we plan to incorporate weakly-labeled or unlabeled data to enable the model
to conduct larger-scale learning. Additionally, since our model can utilize various sources of point
clouds for training, the misuse of collected data could potentially lead to negative social impacts.
