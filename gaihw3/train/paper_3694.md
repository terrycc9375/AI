Abstract

Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain
paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the train-
ing set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters
significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and informa-
tion loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance
among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the
structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask
boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this
paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier (SSA-Seg) to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained
from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center
of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in
semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish
classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation
learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three
publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA-Seg significantly im-
proves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal
increase in computational cost.

Introduction

Semantic segmentation, as a fundamental task in computer vision, aims at assigning a category label
to each pixel in a given image and is widely used in various domains such as autonomous driving [25],
industrial detection [13], satellite image analysis [60, 27] and smart city [26]. Mainstream methods,
such as FCN [34], DeepLab [5, 6], PSPNet [59], and SegNeXt [17] mainly use parametric softmax to
classify each pixel. In recent developments, transformer-based approaches like MaskFormer [10],
Mask2Former [9], and SegViT [55] classify masks by directly learning query vectors, termed as mask-
level classification. However, these mask-level classification models often require heavyweight cross-
attention decoders, which limit their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios [45, 57, 14, 35, 7].

Vanilla parametric softmax uses the convolutional kernel weights as the fixed semantic prototypes and
obtains segmentation masks by computing the inner product of the pixel features and the prototypes.
However, this pixel-level classification method has two obvious drawbacks: (1) feature deviation in
the semantic domain. Due to complex backgrounds and varying object distributions, pixel features in
the test images tend to have a large intra-class variance with pixel features in the training set. However,
the fixed semantic prototypes, representing the semantic feature distribution on the training set, will be
far away from the pixel features of the corresponding class when applied to the test image, as shown in
Fig. 1(b). (2) information loss in the spatial domain. The vanilla pixel-level classifiers only perform

set of the door category. It shows that vanilla pixel-level classifiers directly interact pixel features with the
fixed semantic prototypes, which leads to feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the
spatial domain problems. In contrast, SSA-Seg makes classification decisions based on adaptive semantic and
spatial prototypes by prompting the prototypes to offset toward the center of the semantic domain and the spatial
domain, as shown in (c) and (d). Visual comparison of the baseline and SSA-Seg can be found in Fig. 5.

inner products of fixed prototypes and pixel features in the semantic domain, and lack modeling of
the relationship between prototypes and pixel features in the spatial domain. Therefore, the explicit
structural information of target objects is not fully utilized, leading to suboptimal segmentation of
border regions and small targets.

Recent studies [62, 28, 46] have improved the parametric softmax classifier. ProtoSeg [62] proposes
a nonparametric prototype to replace the standard classifier. Through prototype-based metric learning,
they enhanced the construction of pixel embedding space. GMMSeg [28] models the joint distribution
of pixels and categories and learns the Gaussian mixture classifier in the pixel feature space by using
the EM algorithm. However, these methods still rely on fixed prototype classifiers, when confronted
with varying data distributions on test images, the problem of feature deviation in the semantic
domain still exists. Besides, the Context-aware Classifier (CAC) [44] is proposed, which is a dynamic
classifier by utilizes contextual cues. It adaptively adjusts classification prototypes based on feature
content and thus can alleviate the feature deviation in the semantic domain problem to some extent.
However, due to the lack of constraints on semantic prototypes, the offset of the fixed prototype is
not controllable. In extreme cases, the offset will even be in the direction away from the semantic
features of the image. Besides, these works ignore modeling the relationship between prototype and
pixel features in the spatial domain, which limits further improvements in model performance.

To address the above issues, a Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier (SSA-Seg) is proposed, which
solves the above two problems by facilitating the offset of the fixed prototype towards the center of
the semantic domain and the center of the spatial domain of the test image, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and
(d). Note that the semantic domain center of each class is the mean semantic features belonging to
this class, and similar concepts such as class center also appear in [56, 21]. Similarly, the center of the
spatial domain is the mean spatial features belonging to the class. Specifically, we retain the original
1 × 1 convolution to obtain a coarse mask. Besides, position embedding is applied to the output
features to obtain the spatial information. Then, the coarse mask is applied as the guide to obtain the
semantic domain center and spatial domain center in each sample, which is then processed to obtain
adaptive semantic and spatial prototypes. Finally, classification decisions are made by simultaneously
considering prototypes in the semantic and spatial domains.

In addition, ground truth can be used to improve classifier performance [44]. Therefore, a training-
only teacher classifier is designed to introduce ground truth information for calibrating the primary
classifier. Specifically, we design multi-domain knowledge distillation to enhance the primary
classifier from different domains. First, the response domain distillation method distills the outputs of
the two classifiers based on a boundary-aware and category-aware distillation loss, which conveys
accurate semantic and structural information in the ground truth. Then, semantic domain distillation
and spatial domain distillation are used to constrain the offset of the prototype. In this way, multi-
domain distillation improves the feature representation of the primary classifier, which significantly
improves the test performance.

The proposed method significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline model
with a very small increase in computational cost on three commonly used datasets: ADE20k,
PASCAL-Context, and COCO-stuff-10K. Furthermore, compared to other advanced classifiers

such as GMMSeg [28] and CAC [44], our SSA-Seg achieves significant performance improvement
on several baseline methods. In particular, by applying SSA-Seg, we achieve the state-of-the-
art lightweight segmentation performance. Specially, SeaFormer-L [45] obtain 45.36% mIoU on
ADE20k with only 0.1G more FLOPs and 0.5ms more latency. Simarlily, SegNext-T [17] obtain
38.91% mIoU on COCO-stuff-10K and 52.58% mIoU on PASCAL-Context dataset.

2.1
Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation is one of the basic tasks in computer vision, whose goal is to assign a category
to each pixel in an image. The existing semantic segmentation methods can be divided into two
categories: pixel-level classification model [34, 54, 45, 57, 14, 17] and mask-level classification
model [10, 9, 55, 18, 31, 51]. Since Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) [34], pixel-level classifica-
tion has been the mainstream semantic segmentation method. Subsequent works focus on optimizing
backbone extraction features [17, 45, 8, 52, 33, 53, 50], or improving the decode head for context
modeling [37, 36, 59, 6, 15, 22, 54, 24, 29].

Recently, mask-level classification models have become popular, which learn object queries to
classify masks without classifying each pixel. MaskFormer [10] first proposes to use mask clas-
sification for semantic segmentation tasks, which is inspired by [3]. Mask2Former [9] optimizes
MaskFormer [10] by constraining cross-attention within the predicted masked region to extract local
features. SegViT [55] proposes to apply the mask classifier to plain vision transformers. However,
mask-level classification models often have high computational complexity due to the need for
multiple cross-attention to update the query, and their application fields are limited. Pixel-level
classification model, as the mainstream method, has a wide range of application fields. Therefore, we
rethink pixel-level classifiers to improve the performance of pixel-level classification.

2.2
Pixel-level Classifier

The current mainstream Pixel-level classifier is essentially a discriminant classification model based
on softmax. The potential data distribution is completely ignored, which limits the expressive ability
of the model. Recently, some works [62, 28, 44] have improved the softmax classifier to improve
the segmentation performance. ProtoSeg [62] proposes a non-parametric prototype to replace the
standard classifier. Through prototype-based metric learning, the construction of pixel embedding
space is better. GMMSeg [28] models the joint distribution of pixels and categories and learns the
Gaussian mixture classifier in the pixel feature space by using the EM algorithm. It can capture the
pixel feature distribution of each category in fine detail by using the generator pattern. Context-aware
classifer [44] extracts the context based on the input to generate a sample adaptive classifier. However,
none of these methods use position embedding to improve the classifier. Our classifier can sense both
semantic and spatial information, to make more accurate classification decisions.

Method

3.1
Preliminary: Vanilla Pixel-level Classifier

We first review the architecture of the vanilla pixel-level classifier for semantic segmentation. For an
input image X, the features are first extracted by backbone and processed by decode head to obtain
the output features Sf ∈RH×W ×D, where H, W, D denote the height, width, and channel of the
feature map, respectively. The current mainstream strategy uses a fixed prototype classifier, i.e., a
simple 1 × 1 convolution maps feature to the category space:

  \ sm a ll  \label {eq1} \mathcal {M}_c = \mathcal {S}_f \otimes \mathcal {S}^T, 
(1)
where Mc ∈RH×W ×K denotes the segmentation mask, S ∈RK×D denotes the weights of 1 × 1
convolution kernel, ⊗denotes matrix multiplication and K is the number of category.

The above scheme essentially treats the convolutional kernel weights as fixed semantic prototypes and
obtains segmentation masks based on the inner product with pixel features in the semantic domain.
Therefore, the two questions of feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the
spatial domain, which have been described before, are to be solved.

Figure 2: SSA-Seg overview. For the semantic features Sf output from the backbone and decode head, we first
generate spatial features Pf by position encode. Then we retain the original 1 × 1 convolution to generate the
coarse mask Mc. Guided by Mc, we generate the center of the semantic domain and spatial domain in the
pre-classified representations and fused them with the fixed semantic prototypes S and the prototype position
basis P to generate the semantic prototypes Sp and the spatial prototype Pp. Finally, we consider simultaneously
semantic and spatial prototypes to perform classification decisions. The right figure shows an online teacher
classifier only for training, where the coarse mask is replaced with ground-truth mask to participate in model
training, and constrains the prototype adaption and transfer accurate semantic and spatial knowledge to the
primary classifier based on multi-domain distillation learning.

3.2
Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier

Based on the above analysis in Section 3.1, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive
Classifier (SSA-Seg), as shown in Fig. 2. The proposed SSA-Seg consists of three parts: semantic
prototype adaptation, spatial prototype adaptation, and online multi-domain distillation.

Specifically, for the semantic features Sf output from the backbone and the decode head, we retain
the original 1 × 1 convolution operation to generate the coarse mask Mc. Next, we obtain the spatial
features Pf from the semantic features Sf. Guided by Mc, we integrate the semantic and spatial
features of each category to obtain the centers of the corresponding semantic and spatial domains,
i.e., Sc and Pc. Then, we fuse Sc, Pc with the fixed semantic prototypes S and prototype position
basis P, respectively, to generate adaptive semantic prototypes Sp and spatial prototypes Pp. Finally,
we modify Eq. 1 to make more accurate classification decisions,

  \ sma l l \ m ath c al { O}_c = (\mathcal {S}_f \oplus \mathcal {P}_f) \otimes (\mathcal {S}_p \oplus \mathcal {P}_p)^T, 
(2)

where ⊕denotes element-wise summation. In addition, we introduce a teacher classifier and an online
multi-domain distillation strategy to improve the performance of SSA-Seg. The teacher classifier
has the same structure as the primary classifier, except that the coarse mask Mc is replaced by the
ground-truth mask Mg, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the teacher classifier can output more accurate
semantic prototypes ˆSp, spatial prototypes ˆPp and segmentation masks ˆO. These outputs can be
used as soft labels to constrain the adaptation process of prototypes through online multi-domain
distillation, which consists of response domain distillation loss Lrd, semantic domain distillation loss
Lsd, and spatial domain distillation loss Lpd. Therefore, the training loss L is,

  \s m al l  \mat h cal { L } = \mathcal {L}_c + \mathcal {L}_g + \lambda _r\mathcal {L}_{rd} + \lambda _s\mathcal {L}_{sd} + \lambda _p\mathcal {L}_{pd}, 
(3)

where Lc = Lc

dice, Lg = Lg
ce + Lg
dice, Lc
ce and Lg

respectively. Similarly, Lc

3.2.1
Semantic Prototype Adaptation.

Previous work [44] utilizes additional contextual cues to offset the fixed prototypes and thus adapt to
the semantic feature distributions of different images, alleviating the feature deviation in the semantic
domain problem to some extent. However, due to the lack of constraints, the offset of the fixed
prototype is not controllable. In extreme cases, the offset will even be in the direction away from
the semantic features (An example visualization can be found in Fig. 6.). Therefore, we propose
SEmantic Prototype Adaptation (SEPA), which offsets fixed semantic prototypes based on coarse
mask-guided semantic feature distributions, and constrains the adaptive semantic prototype Sp with
semantic domain distillation.

Specifically, we first multiply the semantic features Sf and the coarse mask Mc to obtain the
semantic domain center Sc, i.e., Sc = SoftmaxK(Mc)⊗Sf, where Sc ∈RK×D denotes the average
features of all pixel features belonging to different classes of the coarse mask-guided pre-classified
representations. We then concatenate Sc with the fixed prototype S, and fuse them through a 1 × 1
convolution layer ϕs to obtain the adaptive semantic prototype Sp ∈RK×D,

  \ small  \mathcal {S}_p = \phi _s(\mathcal {S}_c \odot \mathcal {S}), 
(4)

where ⊙denotes channel concatenation operation. With the above operation and the constraint of
semantic domain distillation loss, the fixed prototype offsets towards the semantic feature distribution
of the test image. As a result, the pixel features possess higher similarity to the semantic prototypes
of the corresponding categories, which promotes more pixels to be correctly categorized.

3.2.2
Spatial Prototype Adaptation.

Previous classifiers [34, 28, 62] are mainly based on the inner product of pixel features and prototypes
in the semantic domain, without utilizing the rich spatial information of the image. However, most of
the target objects in semantic segmentation tasks possess regular shapes, such as doors, windows,
and roads. Modeling the spatial relations of pixel and prototype can introduce structured information
about the target objects, thus improving the segmentation performance for boundary regions and
small targets. Therefore, we introduce spatial prototype adaptation (SPPA), which aims to make
classification decisions with additional consideration of the spatial relation between pixel features
and prototypes.

We first obtain the spatial features Pf ∈RH×W ×D with position encoding of the pixel features
Sf, i.e., Pf = PE(Sf). Here we choose conditional position encoding [11], which is useful for
encoding neighborhood information to further localize the mask region. Similarly, we perform matrix
multiplication based on the coarse mask with the feature position coding to obtain Pc,

  \ small \ma thca l  {P}_c= \text {Softmax}_{HW}(\mathcal {M}_c) \otimes \mathcal {P}_f, 
(5)

where Pc ∈RK×D denotes the spatial domain center of the coarse mask-guided pre-classified
representations. Note that here we implement the softmax function for Mc in spatial dimensions,
which facilitates modeling the spatial distribution of the different categories and thus the spatial
location of the category prototypes on the image.

In addition, only a few categories appear on the image in most cases. Therefore, only the positions of
the corresponding categories in the Pc have practical significance. In order to maintain the stability
of training, we define a randomly initialized position basis P ∈RK×D and concatenate it with Pc to
obtain the spatial prototype Pp ∈RK×D, after mapping with a 1 × 1 convolution layer ϕp,

  \ small  \mathcal {P}_p = \phi _p(\mathcal {P}_c \odot \mathcal {P}). 
(6)

Similarly, based on the above operation and the constraint of spatial domain distillation loss, the
prototype position basis is offset towards the center of the mask region for each class of the test image,
thus generating the spatial prototype Pp. Therefore, the spatial relationship of the pixel features with
the prototype can be taken into account when making the classification decision, which improves
the segmentation performance of the boundaries and the small target regions. This is verified by the
qualitative and quantitative analysis in Section 4.2.

3.2.3
Online Multi-Domain Distillation Learning.

Although semantic and spatial domain adaptations can motivate better interaction of prototypes with
pixel features, the offset of semantic and spatial prototypes is not controllable due to the lack of
constraint, which affects the segmentation performance of the model. In this paper, we propose an
online multi-domain distillation learning to optimize the process of feature generation and constrain
the adaptation of the semantic and spatial prototype.

Specifically, different from the previous widely adopted offline distillation learning method [30, 42,
47, 58, 23], we incorporate ground truth directly into the model training process [44] and construct
soft labels, which can convey useful information to the model and do not require the additional
process of training teacher models. As shown in Fig. 2, we first create a new branch with pixel
features Sf as inputs and use the ground truth Mg to guide the adaption process of semantic and
spatial prototypes, which generates the semantic prototype ˆSp, spatial prototype ˆPp, and segmentation
mask ˆO. ˆPp, ˆSp, and ˆO are used as the online teachers to distillate Pp, Sp, and O, respectively.

Figure 3: Visualization of the inter-class relation matrix for the semantic prototypes Sp and ˆSp, and the latter
possesses better inter-class separability. This motivates us to add semantic domain distillation loss to constrain
the adaption of the semantic prototypes. The results show that after semantic domain distillation, the semantic
prototypes have better separability, which facilitates category recognition.

Response Domain Distillation. The ground truth guided segmentation mask ˆO has a higher entropy
value compared to the one-hot label, which can provide more information to the model. We first give
the expression for the original response domain distillation learning,

(7)

where ψ denotes the Softmax function along the channel dimension. However, the original expression
averages the distillation loss for pixels at all spatial locations, which results in the spatial structural
information of the object and the semantic information of a few sample categories being masked by
pixels at other locations. Therefore, we design a boundary-aware and category-aware distillation loss
to induce the transfer of semantic and spatial information from ˆO to the prediction masks O.

Specifically, we first obtain the semantic mask E via Mg. We then use the Canny operation to extract
the boundary of E and obtain the boundary mask B. Based on E and B, we modify Eq. 7,

(9)

where Hi denotes the entropy of the i-th pixel prediction of ˆO.

Semantic Domain Distillation. We propose the semantic domain distillation loss Lsd to guide
the offset process of semantic prototypes. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the ground truth guided
semantic prototype ˆSp exhibits better inter-class separation properties compared to the Sp. In fact,
the inter-class separation properties are critical for optimizing the feature embedding space and
making classification decisions. Previous work [58] focuses on constraining inter-class relationships
to be identical, which is difficult to train and leads to poor generalization. Intuitively, for inter-class
relationships, we only need to constrain the closer classes in the student model to be farther away.
For those classes that are further away compared to the teacher model, we do not need to negatively
supervise them. Specifically, we first compute the inter-class similarity matrix of semantic prototypes,

 \mathcal {M} = \psi (\mathcal {S}_p \mathcal {S}_p^T),\quad \hat {\mathcal {M}} = \psi (\hat {\mathcal {S}}_p \hat {\mathcal {S}}_p^T).

Note that ˆSp in Eq. 10 is obtained based on the average semantic domain center of all training images
in a batch. It can be used to minimize the negative impact of noisy images and accelerate model
convergence.

With semantic domain distillation, the semantic prototype Sp exhibits similar separability to ˆSp ,
which facilitates the recognition of categories, as shown in Fig. 3 (c) and (d).

Spatial Domain Distillation. Unlike semantic domain distillation, since spatial domain distillation
focuses on the spatial structure information of an object, we tend to constrain the spatial prototypes
guided by the rough mask to be equal to the spatial prototypes guided by the ground-truth mask,

Experiments

We perform experiments on the ADE20K [61], PASCAL-Context [39] and COCO-Stuff-10K [1]
datasets. We use MMSegmentation [12] and follow the common training settings. Please refer to the
Appendix for more details.

4.1
Main Results
Efficiency Comparison. We first focus on the efficiency changes introduced by SSA-Seg, as shown
in Table 1. It can be observed that the additional FLOPs and latency introduced by SSA-Seg is
negligible for methods of different sizes. For example, for general semantic segmentation methods
such as ViT-Adapter-L, we only increase latency by 0.56% and flops by 0.03%, while for lightweight
methods such as SeaFormer-L, we only increase latency by 1.70% and flops by 0.78%. It can be
attributed to the fact that we add only a depth-wise convolution and some 1 × 1 convolutions to the
primary classifier without changing the backbone and segmentation head. Therefore, the increased
memory consumption, FLOPs and latency of SSA-Seg are negligible compared to the original model.

Performance on state-of-the-art general methods. As shown in Table 1, the proposed SSA-Seg
can significantly improve the segmentation performance of various general models with negligi-
ble decrease in efficiency. For example, the application of SSA-Seg on UperNet-Swin-Tiny and
ViT-Adapter-L bring 3.42% and 1.01% mIoU performance improvements on ADE20K dataset,
respectively.

Performance on state-of-the-art lightweight methods. SSA-Seg helps methods such as SeaFormer
and SegNeXt to achieve more superior performance without compromising efficiency. As shown in
Table 1, by applying SSA-Seg, SeaFormer-L achieves 45.36% mIoU on ADE20K, while SegNext-
T achieves 38.91% and 52.58% mIoU on COCO-Stuff-10K and PASCAL-Context datasets, re-
spectively. This is the state-of-the-art performance obtained in real-time segmentation tasks.

Comparison with state-of-
the-art classifiers.
To fur-
ther prove its superior perfor-
mance, the SSA-Seg is com-
pared with other state-of-the-
art classifiers, as shown in
Table 2.
When UperNet is
used as the baseline, the pro-
posed SSA-Seg can improve
the mIoU by 1.20%, while
GMMSeg and DNC only in-
crease mIoU by 1.00% and
0.60%, respectively.
When
OCRNet is used as the base-
line, SSA-Seg exceeds base-
line by 4.2% mIoU, which far
exceeds GMMSeg by 2.7%
mIoU. Also, SSA-Seg ex-
ceeds CAC 1.8% mIoU. For
SegNeXt-T, SSA-Seg exceeds CAC by 0.9% mIoU. Moreover, for the lightweight model SeaFormer,
CAC cannot bring growth. SSA-Seg can still achieve 2.5% mIoU growth. The above experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed SSA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Comparison with state-of-the-art mask classification
models. In order to validate the effectiveness of SSA-
Seg, we further perform a comprehensive comparison with
the state-of-the-art mask classification methods, as shown
in Table 3. It should be noted that the DPG Head in
CGRSeg [40] conflicts with SSA-Seg, and we remove the
DPG Head before adding SSA-Seg.Therefore, compared
with CGRSeg, CGRSeg+SSA-Seg rather reduces the ef-
ficiency metrics such as parameters, FLOPs and latency.
The results show that by combining SSA-Seg, the existing
pixel-level segmentation baselines achieve a better balance
between efficiency and performance compared to mask
classification methods.

Ablation of the position basis. We first explore the ne-
cessity of spatial prototype adaptation. As shown in Table
4, Baseline+basis only means only randomly initialized
position basis is used and the baseline is SeaFormer-L.
It can be observed that when only the positional basis is
retained, the performance of the model is degraded due to the lack of a spatial prototype adaptation
process and the corresponding spatial domain distillation.

Ablation of Spatial domain center. We also conduct an ablation experiment on the spatial domain
center, as shown in Table 6. The results show that applying softmax in the spatial dimension gives
better performance. This can be interpreted as the model learns the relative spatial distribution of
each category and thus models a more accurate spatial domain center.

Ablation of PE. We explore the effect of different position encoding methods on the ADE20K dataset
in Table 7. We chose three widely used methods, namely Sinusoidal position coding [3], learnable
absolute position coding [16], and feature-dependent conditional position coding, i.e., CPVT [11].

The results show that CPVT is particularly effective in improving the results. This can be explained
by the fact that CPVT is able to encode neighborhood information and preserve the implicit positional
priors to locate the region of interest at the center of the spatial domain for the semantic mask. In
contrast, sinusoidal and learnable absolute position encoding can only describe one anchor point,
which is not conducive to the localization of segmented fragments.

Ablation of structure. A series of ablation experiments are
performed to verify the validity of the SEmantic Prototype
Adaption (SEPA) and the SPatial Prototype Adaption (SPPA),
respectively. The experimental results are shown in Table 8.
The 1×1 convolution with softmax is used as the baseline. It
can be found that the baseline achieves only 42.36% mIoU. By
applying SEPA, mIoU increases by 0.52% with a growth of
less than 0.1 GFlops. When combined with Lsd and Lg, mIoU
increases by 1.90%. This validates the necessity of semantic
domain distillation to constrain the semantic prototype adap-
tation process, i.e., they are structurally inseparable. Similarly,
By applying SPPA and Lg + Lpd, mIoU increases by 2.12% and Flops increases by 0.1 G. The
experimental results show that SEPA and SPPA can improve the segmentation performance.

Effect of multi-domain knowledge distillation. Multi-domain
knowledge distillation can significantly improve the feature
representation of SSA-Seg. To verify its performance, we con-
duct related ablation experiments. The experimental results are
shown in Table 9. In the baseline, only the primary classifier is
used, i.e., without teacher classifier. Lg can increase mIoU by
0.60%. By applying response domain distillation Lrd, semantic
domain distillation Lsd, and spatial domain distillation Lpd, the
mIoU can be further increased by 0.67%, 1.09% and 0.84%,
respectively. Multi-domain distillation as a whole can achieve
a 2.09% mIoU improvement. The above experimental results
show that each domain distillation can improve the accuracy,
and multi-domain distillation can further significantly improve the model performance. Furthermore,
we perform an ablation analysis of Lrd design, as shown in Table 5. The results show that the intro-
duction of entropy H, category mask E, and boundary mask B has a role to play in the improvement
of the model performance.

Excluding the effect of model size. To demonstrate
that the performance improvement of the baselines
are due to the effective design of the SSA-Seg rather
than the introduction of additional parameters and
computational consumption, we carry out the exper-
iments shown in Table 10. Specially, Baseline+Conv
means we add several convolutional layers to the orig-
inal SeaFormer-L decoder in order to have the same model size as SeaFormer-L+SSA-Seg. Note
that although SSA-Seg has more parameters, it exhibits better computational efficiency and latency,
which is more important for the efficiency of the model. The experimental results show that such
a significant performance improvement (i.e., +3.0%) cannot be obtained by simply increasing the
baseline parameters and computational consumption.

Effect of SSA-Seg on training. In addition, to further validate the impact of SSA-Seg on model
training, we use SeaFormer-L as the baseline model to evaluate the mIoU boost of SSA-Seg on the

validation set with different iterations, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that compared to the
baseline model, our mIoU increases more significantly and only requires 1/3 of the iterations to
achieve the same segmentation performance as the baseline model. This indicates that the SSA-Seg
accelerates model learning and improves model performance. Note that due to the introduction of
the teacher classifier, we need an average of 1.1 times the training time compared to the original
model. However, the teacher classifier is removed when deploying the model, thus does not affect the
efficiency.

Visual comparison of SSA-Seg and Baseline results. We provide the visualization results of
SSA-Seg, which serves as a complementary illustration to Fig. 1, to further demonstrate that the
SSA-Seg facilitates the adaptation of the fixed prototypes. As shown in Fig. 5, SSA-Seg effectively
facilitates the offset of the prototype towards the center of the semantic domain (Fig. (b)). Since the
adapted prototype is closer to the pixel features of the corresponding category, model can perform
classification decisions more efficiently. As a result, SSA-Seg obtains more accurate segmentation
masks compared to the baseline (Fig. (c) vs. Fig. (a)).

distillation.

Examples of extreme offsets without distillation.
We provide a visual sample to demonstrate our claim
in 3.2.1 i.e., the offset will even be in the direction
away from the semantic features. As shown in Fig.
6, purple and gray indicate pixel features in the wall
and other categories, respectively. Orange star indi-
cates the initial fixed prototype of wall category, and
red star indicates the adapted semantic prototype. It
can be observed that without distillation, the offset of
the prototype is uncontrollable and in extreme cases
moves away from the semantic features of the corre-
sponding image, resulting in more pixels belonging
to the wall category being misclassified as curtains.
Therefore, we introduce online multi-domain distil-
lation to constrain the adaptation of the semantic and
spatial prototype.

Conclusion

In this paper, we analyze that current pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation suffers limita-
tions such as feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. To
this end, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier (SSA-Seg). Specifically, we
employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype
towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. In addition, we propose an
online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to guide the adaption process. Experimental results
on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA-Seg significantly improves the
segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational
cost. In particular, SSA-Seg boosts the lightweight model to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
The superior performance proves that SSA-Seg can replace the vanilla pixel-level classifiers and thus
contribute to the semantic segmentation research.

SUMMARY OF THE APPENDIX

In the appendix, we provide the following items that shed deeper insight on our contributions:

• §A: Dataset and Implementation Details.

• §B: More experimental results.

• §C: More qualitative visualization.

• §D: Extra analysis

A
Dataset and Implementation Details.

A.1
Datasets

ADE20K [61] is a challenging segmentation dataset, which contains about 20,000 images and covers
150 categories. All images are annotated with pixel-level objects and object parts labels. The training
set, validation set, and the test set contain 20210, 2000, and 3352 images respectively.

PASCAL-Context [39] is a common semantic segmentation dataset, which contains 10100 images.
The train dataset contains 4996 images and test set contains 5104 images. 59 categories are labeled
in this dataset.

COCO-Stuff-10K [1] is an extension of the coco dataset, which labels pixel-level objects. It contains
172 categories with 80 things, 91 stuff and 1 unlabeled class. There are 9K/1K images for training
and testing, respectively.

A.2
Implementation details

We use MMSegmentation [12] and follow the common training settings. During training, we apply
data enhancement sequentially by random horizontal flipping, random resizing with a scale between
0.5 and 2.0, and random cropping. For ADE20K and COCO-Stuff-10K, we have a cropping size of
512 × 512, while for PASCAL-Context, we have a cropping size of 480 × 480. In addition, the batch
size of all datasets is 16, and the total iterations for ADE20K, COCO-Stuff-10K and PASCAL-Context
number are 160k, 80k and 80k, respectively. When inference is performed, we use whole-image
inference mode. We use the mean intersection and merger ratio (mIoU) as main metric to evaluate
the performance. For the chosen baseline model, we fully follow the experimental configurations
such as learning rate and optimizer of the original model. During testing, we use single-scale (SS)
test strategies for fair comparison. In the implementation of this paper, λr, λp, λs are all set to 1, and
the edge size of boundary is set to 4. Note that for SSA-Seg-related experiments, we choose different
random seed replications for three times and select the corresponding intermediate values as the final
evaluation metric values. The experimental error is less than 0.4% .

B
More experimental results.

Ablation of edge size of boundary. The size of the edges of the boundary masks affects the
performance of the response domain distillation. We explore this as shown in Table 11. The results
show that the optimal segmentation results are achieved when the size of the edges is set to 4.

In particular, there is a slight degradation in the performance of the
model when either the edge size of the boundary is increased (i.e.,
edge size is 5) or decreased (i.e., edge size is 3). We argue that
a plausible explanation is that small edge size of the boundary is
not sufficient to retain enough boundary information, while large
edge size of the boundary does not decouple the knowledge transfer
between boundary and non-boundary regions, which results in the
pixel feature information of boundary regions being interfered with
by non-boundary regions.

Ablation of different loss combinations. We conduct experiments
on the ade20k dataset to explore the segmentation performance of different loss combinations, as
shown in Table 13. We observe that only when both λr and λp are 1, the corresponding segmentation

to exhibit larger intra-class variance when the trained model on the training set is applied to the test set.

results are relatively high, i.e., 44.67%, 44.82%, and 44.86%. Furthermore, we achieve the most
superior segmentation performance when λs is also 1.

Ablation of the distillation method. An
alternative distillation strategy is to self-
distill instead of using ground-truth. self-
distillation means we use the output of
the main classifier O to distill the coarse
mask Mc instead of the truth mask Mg.
The results in Table 12 show that the self-
distillation scheme performs poorly. We argue that the ground-truth can provide more accurate
semantic information, while the segmentation results of output O often have some misclassified
pixels, which can mislead the model’s learning process from the teacher classifiers. Therefore, the
prototype will offset inaccurately and impairs the segmentation performance.

C
More qualitative visualization.

Visual analysis of segmentation output.
We use SeaFormer-L as the baseline to visualize
the segmentation mask, as shown in Fig. 8.
SeaFormer and CAC misclassify the door as
the wall, and the sofas as the armchair in the second and fourth row of images, respectively.

ent loss combinations on the ADE20K

Our method has high accuracy for these confusing classes,
which verifies that semantic prototype adaptation can mitigate
the intra-class variance problem for correct recognition. In
addition, the segmentation masks of SeaFormer and CAC for
the curtain show fragmentation in the first row of images. While
in the third row of images, the masks for the sidewalk show
the same situation. In contrast, the shape of our segmentation
masks is close to ground truth, especially in the boundary region.
This validates the effectiveness of our introduction of spatial
prototype adaption to model the structure of semantic objects.

Visual analysis of CAM. In addition, for the features output
from the backbone, from top to bottom, we carry out CAM for
the class of curtain, door, sidewalk, and sofa, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 8, it can be seen that compared to SeaFormer
and CAC, SSA-Seg is able to present stronger activation values
in the center region of the mask and does not show too much
activation in irrelevant regions. These qualitative analyses re-
flect the effectiveness of SSA-Seg in performing classification
decisions.

D
Extra analysis.

D.1
Limitation analysis.

As a novel pixel-level classifier, SSA-Seg is able to significantly improve the performance of various
baselines with a minor increase in computational cost. However, it is not compatible with mask
classification methods [10, 9] due to differences in classification paradigms. Therefore, SSA-Seg
cannot be applied to improve the performance of segmentation networks such as Mask2Former
[9], SegViT [55], and ECENet [31]. This limits the application scope of SSA-Seg to some extent.
However, when SSA-Seg is combined with efficient segmentation models such as SegNeXt [17],
EfficientViT [2], it can achieve even better performance with the same or less computation compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, SSA-Seg needs to rely on more advanced pixel-level semantic
segmentation methods to boost its performance on general semantic segmentation tasks.

Note that in the field of mobile segmentation (or real-time segmentation), the pixel-level classification
paradigm is still absolutely dominant, due to the fact that masked classification methods require
multiple cross-attention to update the query, resulting in higher computational complexity and
latency. Whereas SSA-Seg is able to integrate directly into existing mobile segmentation models,
thus significantly improving segmentation performance with essentially no compromise on model
efficiency. This validates the applicability and deployability of SSA-Seg.

D.2
Comparison with OCRNet.

SSA-Seg is obviously different from some class-level context modeling approaches such as OCRNet
[54]. First, OCRNet is a context aggregation module that enhances the representation of features
based on context-aggregated class representations, but still requires a Softmax classifier (i.e., a fixed
semantic prototype) to perform classification decisions. SSA-Seg, on the other hand, is a classifier
whose semantic prototype is dynamic and can be offset towards the center of the semantic domain
of the image. In addition, SSA-Seg can be combined with OCRNet as a classifier to enhance the
performance of OCRNet, as shown in Table 1. Finally, SSA-Seg additionally introduces spatial
prototype adaptation and online multi-domain distillation, which is significantly different from the
work of OCRNet. Overall, SSA-Seg aims to adapt the fixed prototype towards the center of the
semantic and spatial domains in the test image to solve the problem of feature deviation in the
semantic domain and loss of information in the spatial domain that exists in fixed prototype classifiers.

17


---Page Break---
Therefore, SSA-Seg is significantly different from existing context modeling methods [54, 56, 24],
mask classifiers [9, 10], and pixel-level classifiers [28, 62, 46].

D.3
Structural Effectiveness Analysis.

An interesting phenomenon as shown in Table 8 is that the SSA-Seg architecture (i.e., Base-
line+SEPA+SPPA) achieves only marginal improvements (+0.91%), which is not an indication
that the design of SSA-Seg is ineffective. Note that both the semantic prototype adaptation and spatial
prototype adaptation processes involved in SSA-Seg need to be constrained by the corresponding
distillation loss. Otherwise, the offset of the corresponding prototype will be uncontrollable. In
extreme cases, the offset will even be in the direction away from the semantic/spatial features, as
shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the adaptation process of SSA-Seg in the semantic or spatial domain
needs to be combined with the corresponding distillation loss, and the two are closely linked and
inseparable. As shown in Table 8, both the adaptation of semantic prototypes (+1.9%) and the
adaptation of spatial prototypes (+2.12%) significantly improve the segmentation performance of the
baseline model, which validates the effectiveness of the SSA-Seg architecture design.

D.4
Complementary analysis of SPPA.

Please note that the SPPA does not assume that objects of the same class should all be in a specific
region of the image. Although SPPA proposes the concept of spatial domain centers, our spatial
domain centers are obtained based on the Conditional Positional Vocoding (CPVT) [11], which
represents for relative segments rather than absolute anchor points. Therefore, our spatial domain
center models the collection of information about neighboring segments belonging to the same object,
rather than an absolute one point. In other words, it enables the model to indirectly take into account
the semantic features of pixels at neighboring locations when classifying them. Second, many images
in ADE20k and COCO-stuff have the same category scattered in different areas. Nevertheless, our
SSA-Seg can still significantly improve the performance of the model on these datasets. This is
because SPPA takes into account the spatial structure information. We have conducted ablation
experiments on SPPA in the paper, as shown in Table 8. When SPPA and distillation loss are applied,
the model accuracy increased by 2.12% mIoU. This validates the effectiveness of spatial domain
adaptation.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to abstract and the lines 74-81 of the introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the Sec. D in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide all the implementation details, please refer to Sec. A in the
Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

20


---Page Break---

Justification: We provide all the code and configuration files in order to reproduce the
experiments in the paper. The datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Sec. A in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Sec. A in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

21


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Justification: We did not conduct statistics on this topic.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited the public datasets and code repositories involved in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
