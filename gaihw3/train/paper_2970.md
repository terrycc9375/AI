Abstract

The growing interest in vision-language models (VLMs) has been driven by im-
provements in large language models and vision transformers. Despite the abun-
dance of literature on this subject, we observe that critical decisions regarding the
design of VLMs are often not justified. We argue that these unsupported decisions
impede progress in the field by making it difficult to identify which choices im-
prove model performance. To address this issue, we conduct extensive experiments
around pre-trained models, architecture choice, data, and training methods. Our
consolidation of findings includes the development of Idefics2, an efficient founda-
tional VLM of 8 billion parameters. Idefics2 achieves state-of-the-art performance
within its size category across various multimodal benchmarks, and is often on par
with models four times its size. We release the model (base, instructed, and chat)
along with the datasets created for its training.

Prompt

For 2024, the interest expense is twice what it 
was in 2014, and the long-term debt is 10% 
higher than its 2015 level. Can you calculate the 

combined total of the interest and long-term debt 
for 2024?

Idefics2 output

Yes, I can help you calculate that. First, let's find out 

the interest expense for 2024:
Interest Expense (2024) = 2 * Interest Expense (2014)
= 2 * 630

= 1260
Next, let's find the long-term debt for 2024:
Long-Term Debt (2024) = Long-Term Debt (2015) + 

10% of Long-Term Debt (2015)
= 19,260 + 0.1 * 19,260
= 19,260 + 1,926

= 21,186
Now, we can add these two amounts together to get 
the combined total of the interest and long-term debt 

for 2024:
Combined Total (2024) = Interest Expense (2024) + 
Long-Term Debt (2024)

= 1260 + 21,186
= 22,446
So, the combined total of the interest and long-term 

debt for 2024 is $22,446.

Introduction

Vision-language models (VLMs) that take images and texts as inputs and output texts, are useful
for many tasks, like retrieving information in a scanned PDF (Hu et al., 2024), explaining charts or
diagrams (Carbune et al., 2024), transcribing the text in an image (Blecher et al., 2023), counting
objects in a picture (Goyal et al., 2017) or turning screenshots of webpages into code (Laurençon
et al., 2024). The development of powerful open large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang
et al., 2023; Team et al., 2024) and image encoders (Zhai et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Radford et al.,
2021) enables researchers to build upon these unimodal pre-trained models to create advanced VLMs
that solve these problems with increasing accuracy (Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023;
Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Despite the progress in the field, the literature
reveals many disparate design choices which are often not justified experimentally, or very briefly.

This situation makes it challenging to distinguish which decisions truly account for model perfor-
mance, thereby making it difficult for the community to make meaningful and grounded progress.
For instance, (Alayrac et al., 2022; Laurençon et al., 2023) use interleaved Transformer-based cross-
attentions to fuse the image information into the language model, while (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2023) concatenate the sequence of image hidden states with the sequence of text embeddings, and
feed the concatenated sequence to the language model. To our knowledge, this choice has not been
properly ablated, and trade-offs in terms of compute, data efficiency and performance are poorly
understood. In this work, we aim to bring experimental clarity to some of these core design choices
and pose the question: What matters when building vision-language models?

We identify two areas where various works adopt different design choices: (a) model architecture,
and in particular, connector modules that fuse the vision and text modalities and their impact on
inference efficiency, (b) multimodal training procedure and its impact on training stability. For each
of these areas, we rigorously compare different design choices in a controlled environment and extract
experimental findings. Notably, we find that (a) the progress of vision-language models is in large part
driven by the progress of pre-trained unimodal backbones, (b) the more recent fully autoregressive
architecture outperforms the cross-attention architecture, although it requires modifications to the
optimization procedure to ensure a stable training, (c) adaptation of the pre-trained vision backbone
and the modules connecting the text and vision modalities allow for more efficiency at inference
time on one side, and handling images in their original ratio and size without harming downstream
performance on the other side, and (d) modifications to the image processing enables trading inference
cost for downstream performance.

Our results are complementary with those presented in (Karamcheti et al., 2024; McKinzie et al.,
2024; Lin et al., 2023) which derive insights about multi-stage training, selective unfreezing of the pre-
trained backbones, data repetition, and impact of training mixture on zero and few-shot performance.
We specifically analyze unexplored aspects such as model architecture, training methods, stability,
and efficiency improvements at inference. For example, we introduce the task of text transcription
from PDFs directly in the pre-training, we justify the benefits of using synthetic captions in image-text
pair datasets, we detail our multi-stage training procedure to save computational resources, and we
create a large-scale instruction fine-tuning dataset.

Learning from these insights, we train Idefics2, a foundational VLM with 8 billion parameters.
Idefics2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in its size category on various benchmarks while being
more efficient at inference, for both the base and the fine-tuned version. It is on par with state-of-
the-art models 4 times larger on some vision-language benchmarks and matches the performance of
Gemini 1.5 Pro on some challenging benchmarks. We release the base, instructed, and chat versions
of Idefics21 as resources for the VLM community along with the data created to train the model.

Terminology

We first establish shared terminology for discussing the different design choices. Training VLMs
typically requires gluing together a pre-trained vision backbone and a pre-trained language backbone
by initializing new parameters to connect the two modalities. Training these new parameters is
done during the pre-training phase. This stage commonly leverages a large multimodal dataset such
as image-caption pairs. We note that even though it is most common to start from two separate

---Page Break---
unimodal pre-trained backbones, the parameters of these two backbones can be optionally shared and
initialized from scratch as done in (Bavishi et al., 2023). As in the large language models literature,
the pre-training stage is followed by an instruction fine-tuning stage, in which the model learns from
task-oriented samples.

Recent works explore two main choices to combine the visual inputs and the text inputs. In the
cross-attention architecture (Alayrac et al., 2022; Laurençon et al., 2023; Awadalla et al., 2023),
the images encoded through the vision backbone are injected at different layers within the language
model by interleaving cross-attention blocks in which the text cross-attends to the image hidden states.
In contrast, in the fully autoregressive architecture (Koh et al., 2023; Driess et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2023), the output of the vision encoder is directly concatenated to the sequence of text embeddings,
and the entire sequence is passed as input to the language model. The input sequence of the language
model is thus the concatenation of visual tokens and text tokens. The sequence of visual tokens can be
optionally pooled into a shorter sequence, providing more compute efficiency. We refer to the layers
that maps the vision hidden space to the text hidden space as modality projection layers. Figure 2
highlights the fully-autoregressive architecture we ultimately use for Idefics2.

The resulting visual features are mapped (and optionally pooled) to the LLM input space to get the
visual tokens (64 in our standard configuration). They are concatenated (and potentially interleaved)
with the input sequence of text embeddings (green and red column). The concatenated sequence is
fed to the language model (LLM), which predicts the text tokens output.

Exploring the design space of vision-language models

In this section, we compare recurrent design choices in the vision-language model literature and
highlight findings. Unless specified otherwise, we run the ablations for 6’000 steps and report
the average score of the 4-shot performance on 4 downstream benchmarks measuring different
capabilities: VQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017) for general visual question answering, TextVQA (Singh
et al., 2019) for OCR abilities, OKVQA (Marino et al., 2019) for external knowledge, and COCO
(Lin et al., 2014) for captioning. We run the ablations on eight nodes containing eight H100s each,
for up to five days.

3.1
Are all pre-trained backbones equivalent for VLMs?

Most recent VLMs start from pre-trained unimodal backbones. How does the choice of the backbones
(vision and text) influence the performance of the resulting VLM?

We fix the size of the pretrained backbones, the data used for multi-
modal pre-training, and the number of training updates. Under the
cross-attention architecture, we observe that the greatest improve-
ment in the performance on vision-language benchmarks comes
from changing the language model to a better one. More specif-
ically, replacing LLaMA-1-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) (35.1% on
MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021)) by Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023)

(60.1% on MMLU) yields a boost of 5.1 (see Table 1). Additionally, switching the vision encoder
from CLIP-ViT-H (Radford et al., 2021) (78.0% on ImageNet(Deng et al., 2009)) to SigLIP-SO400M
(Zhai et al., 2023) (83.2% on ImageNet) yields a 3.3 increase in performance on the benchmarks (see
Table 2). This result on better vision backbones corroborates observations from (Karamcheti et al.,
2024).

Table 2: Ablation on the vision encoder

We note that Chen and Wang (2022) reports a stronger increase
in performance by scaling the size of the vision encoder com-
pared to scaling the size of the language model even though
scaling the vision encoder leads to a smaller parameter count in-
crease. Although EVA-CLIP-5B (Sun et al., 2023) is ten times
bigger in parameter counts than SigLIP-SO400M (Zhai et al.,
2023), we obtain similar performance across 4 benchmarks,
suggesting that EVA-CLIP-5B could be heavily under-trained,
and we acknowledge that the open VLM community is missing a large well-trained vision encoder.

Finding 1.
Better pre-trained LLMs and vision encoders lead to better performance on
multimodal tasks. However, with the best current models for both, the LLM has a higher
impact.

3.2
How does the fully autoregressive architecture compare to the cross-attention
architecture?

To our knowledge, there is no proper comparison between the fully autoregressive and the cross-
attention architecture. We aim to fill this gap by considering their trade-offs, namely performance,
parameter count, and inference cost.

Table 3: Ablation for the architecture and method of training.

Following (Alayrac et al.,
2022), we first compare
the
two
architectures
by
freezing
the
uni-
modal
backbones
and
training only the newly
initialized
parameters
(cross-attention on one
side, and modality pro-
jection along with learned pooling on the other side), while fixing the amount of training data.
Alayrac et al. (2022) shows that the more frequently the cross-attention blocks are interleaved with
the language model layers, and the higher the vision-language performance. As such, we note
that under this setup, the cross-attention architecture has 1.6B more trainable parameters (2.3B
trainable parameters in total) than the fully autoregressive architecture. Additionally, at inference
time, the former uses 10% more flops than the latter. Under these conditions, we observe that the
cross-attention architecture performs 7 points better in Table 3.

Out of the total number of parameters, approximately 10% for the fully autoregressive architecture and
25% for the cross-attention are trained. We hypothesize that this low proportion limits the expressivity
of the training and hinders performance. To test that hypothesis, we compare the two architectures by
unfreezing all parameters (newly initialized parameters and parameters of the pre-trained unimodal
backbones). Under these conditions, training the fully autoregressive architecture would yield loss
divergences, and we were not successful in stabilizing the training even by aggressively lowering
the learning rate or gradually unfreezing various components. To overcome this stability challenge,
we leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2022) to adapt the pre-trained parameters while using
standard full fine-tuning for the newly initialized ones.

This setup yields significantly more stable trainings, and more importantly, we observe a 12.9
points increase under the fully autoregressive architecture, and 0.6 point under the cross-attention
architecture. While the cross-attention architecture performs better than the fully autoregressive
architecture with frozen backbones, it is worse when we add degrees of liberty for the pre-trained
backbones. Besides, using LoRA allows training the unimodal backbones at a fraction of the GPU
memory cost of full fine-tuning, and LoRA layers can be merged back into the original linear layers

---Page Break---
yielding no additional cost at inference. We therefore choose the fully autoregressive architecture in
the rest of this work.

It is interesting to note that this finding contradicts (Karamcheti et al., 2024) in which the authors
observed that unfreezing the pre-trained visual backbone would significantly degrade the performance.
We hypothesize that using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods is a key difference.

Finding 2.
The cross-attention architecture performs better than the fully autoregressive one
when unimodal pre-trained backbones are kept frozen. However, when training the unimodal
backbones, the fully autoregressive architecture outperforms the cross-attention one, even
though the latter has more parameters.

Finding 3.
Unfreezing the pre-trained backbones under the fully autoregressive architecture
can lead to training divergences. Leveraging LoRA still adds expressivity to the training and
stabilizes it.

3.3
Where are the efficiency gains?

Number of visual tokens
Recent VLMs typically route the entire sequence of the vision encoder’s
hidden states directly into the modality projection layer, which subsequently inputs into the language
model, with no pooling. This is motivated by previous works in which adding a pooling strategy,
like average pooling, was found to deteriorate the performance (Vallaeys et al., 2024). This results
in a high number of visual tokens for each image ranging from 576 for DeepSeek-VL (Lu et al.,
2024) to 2890 for SPHINX-2k (Lin et al., 2023). With the resulting sequence lengths, training is
computationally costly, and in-context learning with interleaved images and texts is challenging
because it requires modifications to the language models to handle very large context windows.

We reduce the sequence length of each image’s hidden states by using a perceiver resampler (Jaegle
et al., 2021) as a form of trainable Transformer-based pooling. The number of queries (also referred
to as latents) corresponds to the number of resulting visual tokens after the pooling (from one for
classification Touvron et al. (2021) to several in Alayrac et al. (2022) or a growing number for
continual learning Douillard et al. (2022)). We observe that the learned pooling is effective in two
ways: it increases the performance by 8.5 points on average and reduces the number of visual tokens
necessary for each image from 729 to 64 (see Table 3).

Table 4: Ablation on the pooling strategy.

In contrast to (Vallaeys et al., 2024; McKinzie et al., 2024)
which find that the more visual tokens the higher the perfor-
mance, we observe no gains when using more than 64 visual
tokens. Other variations over the Perceiver architecture (Mañas
et al., 2023; Darcet et al., 2024; Vallaeys et al., 2024) resulted
in decreased performance.

Finding 4.
Reducing the number of visual tokens with learned pooling significantly improves
compute efficiency at training and inference while improving performance on non-OCR
downstream tasks.

Preserving the original aspect ratio and image resolution
Vision encoders, such as SigLIP, are
typically trained on fixed-size square images. Resizing images alters their original aspect ratio, which
is problematic, for instance, for tasks requiring reading long texts. Furthermore, conditioning the
training on a single resolution size inherently introduces limitations: a low resolution omits crucial
visual details, while a high resolution leads to inefficiency in training and inference. Allowing the
model to encode images at various resolutions allows users to decide how much compute is spent on
each image.

Following Lee et al. (2023); Dehghani et al. (2023), we pass
the image patches to the vision encoder without resizing
the image or modifying its aspect ratio. Given that SigLIP
was trained on fixed-size low-resolution square images, we
interpolate the pre-trained positional embeddings to allow for

5


---Page Break---
a higher resolution and train the vision encoder with LoRA
parameters to adapt to these modifications.2
Our findings indicate that the aspect ratio preserving strategy maintains performance levels on
downstream tasks while unlocking computational flexibility during both training and inference (see
Table 5). In particular, not having to resize images to the same high resolution allows for saving GPU
memory and handling images at the resolution they require.

Finding 5.
Adapting a vision encoder pre-trained on fixed-size square images to preserve
images’ original aspect ratio and resolution does not degrade performance while speeding up
training and inference and reducing memory.

3.4
How can one trade compute for performance?

(Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; McKinzie et al., 2024) show that splitting an
image into sub-images allows boosting the downstream performance with no changes to the model’s
signature. An image is decomposed into sub-images (for instance 4 equal sub-images), which are
then concatenated to the original image to form a sequence of 5 images. Additionally, the sub-images
are resized to the original image’s size. This strategy however comes at the cost of a much higher
number of tokens to encode the images.

We adopt this strategy during the instruction fine-tuning stage. Each single image becomes a list
of 5 images: 4 crops and the original image. This way, at inference, the model is able to deal with
standalone images (64 visual tokens per image), as well as artificially augmented images (320 visual
tokens in total per image). We notice that this strategy is particularly useful for benchmarks like
TextVQA and DocVQA, which require a sufficiently high resolution to extract the text in an image
(see Table 9).

Moreover, when we apply image splitting to only 50% of the training samples (instead of 100% of the
samples), we observe that it does not impair the performance increase that image splitting provides.
Surprisingly, we find at evaluation time that increasing the resolution of the sub-images (and the
standalone image) provides only a minor boost in performance compared to the improvement yielded
by sole image splitting: 73.6% when increasing the resolution of the sub-images to the maximum
vs 73.0% accuracy on our validation set of TextVQA, and respectively 72.7 vs 72.9 ANLS on the
validation set of DocVQA.

Finding 6.
Splitting images into sub-images during training allow trading compute efficiency
for more performance during inference. The increase in performance is particularly noticeable
in tasks involving reading text in an image.

Idefics2 - an open state-of-the-art vision-language foundation model

With these learnings in hand, we train an open 8B parameters vision-language model: Idefics2. This
section describes the construction of the model, the choice of the dataset, the sequence of training
phases and compares the resulting model against VLMs baselines.

4.1
Multi-stage pre-training

We start from SigLIP-SO400M and Mistral-7B-v0.1 and pre-train Idefics2 on 3 types of data.

Interleaved image-text documents We use OBELICS (Laurençon et al., 2023), an open web-scale
dataset of interleaved image-text documents with 350 million images and 115 billion text tokens. As
shown by the authors, the long documents of OBELICS allow for preserving the performance of the
language model while learning to deal with an arbitrary number of interleaved images and texts and
long context. Additionally, the authors show that interleaved image-text documents are the biggest
driving factor in increasing the performance on visual question answering (VQA) tasks, in particular

2Since SigLIP is trained with a fixed resolution, the positional embeddings can be interpreted both as absolute
or relative positions. With the aspect ratio and resolution preserving, these positions become relative positional
embeddings.

in the in-context learning setup. We perform an additional removal of newly opted-out content in
January 2024 using the Spawning API3 even though OBELICS had already been filtered to exclude
opted-out content as of September 2023. We also removed the 5% of documents with the highest
perplexity scores, as computed by Falcon-1B (Penedo et al., 2023).

Image-text pairs
Training on image-text pairs allows the model to
learn the alignment between images and their associated texts. We use
a combination of high-quality human-annotated image-text pairs from
PMD (Singh et al., 2022) and higher-noise web-scale image-text pairs
from (Schuhmann et al., 2022). To limit the amount of poor-quality data,
we opt for the synthetic captions obtained through the LAION COCO4
version of the dataset where images have been captioned with a model
trained on COCO. This improves the quality of the training samples and
thus the quality of the resulting model (see Table 6). We use a NSFW classifier5 with a high recall
and remove 7% of the samples in LAION COCO. We manually inspect 5’000 examples and found
28 pornographic images in the original LAION COCO and only 1 after filtering. This filtering does
not negatively impact the downstream performance.

PDF documents
Sun et al. (2023) shows that a large pro-
portion of mistakes of state-of-the art VLMs stem from their
failure to accurately extract text in images or documents. In
order to obtain strong OCR and document understanding abil-
ities, we train Idefics2 on different sources of PDF documents:
19 million industry documents from OCR-IDL (Biten et al.,
2022) and 18 million pages from PDFA6. Moreover, we add
Rendered Text7 to complement the dataset with texts writ-
ten with a wide variety of fonts and colors and on diverse
backgrounds. These integrations significantly boost the per-
formance on benchmarks that require reading text without decreasing the performance on other
benchmarks (see Table 7).

To maximize compute efficiency, we decompose the pre-training in two stages. In the first stage, we
limit the max image resolution to 384 pixels, which allows us to use a large global batch size of 2’048
(17k images and 2.5M text tokens on average). We sample OBELICS for 70% of the examples with a
maximum sequence length of 2’048, and the image-text pairs datasets for 30% of the examples with
a maximum sequence length of 1’536. In the second stage, we introduce PDF documents. Since they
require a higher image resolution for the text to be legible, we increase the resolution to a maximum
of 980 pixels. We use the same global batch size, but have to decrease the per-device batch size and
use gradient accumulation to compensate for the additional memory cost. OBELICS represents 45%
of the examples with a maximum sequence length of 2’048, image-text pairs represent 35% of the
examples with a maximum sequence length of 1’536, and PDF documents represent the remaining
20% of the examples with a maximum sequence length of 1’024. Additionally, we randomly scale
up images to adequately cover the distribution of potential image sizes. We emphasize that the
training stages are different than the ones ablated in (Karamcheti et al., 2024): instead of selectively
freezing/unfreezing parts of the model, we train the entire model during both stages (some parameters
are trained with LoRA) and increase the image resolution from one stage to the other.

We use a learning rate of 10−4 with AdamW for the optimizer, and do around 2 epochs on our training
data. It corresponds to approximately 1.5 billion images and 225 billion text tokens. We note that this
is orders of magnitude more training data than other open VLMs. For example, ShareGPT (Chen
et al., 2023) uses 1.2 million images, while Monkey (Li et al., 2023) uses 1.4 million for training. In
total, we use 32 nodes of eight H100s each for 3 weeks for the multi-stage pre-training.

To evaluate the base model, we consider VQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017), TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019),
OKVQA (Marino et al., 2019), and COCO (Lin et al., 2014). Table 8 presents the results. While
having fewer tokens per image, and thus being more efficient, Idefics2-base performs favorably

(Laurençon et al., 2023), Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), and MM1 (McKinzie et al., 2024)). It is
notably much better at reading texts in an image. Figure 3 shows an example of an output from the
base model on a task similar to the pre-training.

Dear Craig,
Actually, I've never been big on letter writing, though it is nice to receive 
a hand written note from someone. I am afraid that the art of drawing, 
and the related ability to sketch an idea, are also being lost. But perhaps, 
as the cliche goes, what goes around comes around.
Good luck with your project.
Tom Cianfichi

Instruction fine-tuning

We continue the training with an instruction fine-tuning phase.

To do so, we create and release The Cauldron8, a massive collection of 50 vision-language datasets,
covering a wide range of tasks: general visual question answering, counting, captioning, text tran-
scription, document understanding, chart/figure understanding, table understanding, visual reasoning,
geometry, spotting differences between 2 images or converting a screenshot to a functional code. Sim-
ilarly to (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Bach et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), each
dataset is prompted into a shared question/answer format. When there are multiple question/answer
pairs per image, we concatenate the pairs into a multi-turn conversation. We deduplicate the training
set against the evaluation sets, ensuring that there is minimum contamination from the training to the
evaluation.

In addition to these vision-language datasets and following insights from (McKinzie et al., 2024), we
add text-only instruction datasets to the mixture. The datasets aim at teaching the model to follow
complex instructions, solve mathematical problems, or do arithmetic calculations. We give more
details about the chosen datasets, the number of images, question-answer pairs, and size of each of
the subsets, as well as our selected mixture proportion in Table 14 in Appendix A.2.1.

We instruction-tune the base model using DoRA (Liu et al., 2024) (a variant of LoRA). During the
fine-tuning, we only compute the loss on the tokens of the answers in the Q/A pairs. Since we are
doing many epochs over some of the datasets, we employ several strategies to lower the risk of
overfitting. First, we add noise to the embeddings with the NEFTune (Jain et al., 2024) technique.

Table 9: Performance of Idefics2 against state-of-the-art VLMs up to a size of 14B parameters. The
evaluations are done in zero shot. Idefics2 with 64 or 320 tokens per image is the same model (same
weights), only the inference differs. The full table is present in Appendix A.3.2.
(Benchmark, Split, Metric): (MMMU, val/test, MMMU score), (MathVista, testmini, MMMU score),
(TextVQA, val, VQA acc.), (MMBench, test, accuracy).

Then, we scale up randomly the resolution of the images during the training. Finally, when applicable,
we shuffle the multiple user/assistant turns randomly before feeding the example to the model.

We evaluate Idefics2 on commonly adopted benchmarks: MMMU (Yue et al., 2024) for multidis-
cipline college-level problems, MathVista (Lu et al., 2024) for mathematical reasoning, TextVQA
(Singh et al., 2019) for text reading on natural images, and MMBench Liu et al. (2023) for various
perception and reasoning tasks. Table 9 presents the results (see Table 15 for the complete result
table) of Idefics2 against the current strongest VLMs in its class size: LLaVA-Next (Liu et al., 2024),
DeepSeek-VL (Lu et al., 2024) and MM1-Chat (McKinzie et al., 2024). While being computation-
ally much more efficient at inference, Idefics2 exhibits strong performance on various benchmarks,
outperforming the current best foundation VLMs in its size category. It is on par with state-of-the-art
models 4x its size, or with closed-source models like Gemini 1.5 Pro on several benchmarks like
MathVista or TextVQA. The detailed performance of Idefics2 across each category of MMMU (Yue
et al., 2024) is present in Table 16.

4.3
Optimizing for chat scenarios

The evaluation benchmarks expect very short answers, but humans prefer long generations when inter-
acting with a model. We find that Idefics2 can exhibit difficulties in precisely following instructions
about the expected format, making it difficult to reconcile “chattiness“ and downstream performance.
As such, after instruction fine-tuning, we further train Idefics2 on dialogue data. We fine-tune Idefics2
for a few hundred steps on LLaVA-Conv (Liu et al., 2023) and ShareGPT4V (Chen et al., 2023),
with a large batch size. Our blind human evaluations reveal that Idefics2-chatty is overwhelmingly
preferred over its instruction fine-tuned version in many user interactions. We also adversarially
stress-tested the model to generate inaccurate, biased, or offensive responses and reported the findings
in Appendix A.5. We show examples of generations with Idefics2-chatty in Figure 1, and in Appendix
in Figures 5, 6 and 7.

Conclusion

In this work, we re-examine common choices made in the VLM literature and rigorously compare
these choices in controlled experiments. Our findings touch upon the effectiveness of different
architectures, their performance/inference cost trade-offs as well as training stability. With these
learnings at hand, we train Idefics2, an open 8B parameters vision-language model. Idefics2 is
state-of-the-art on various benchmarks in its category size and is much more efficient at inference.
By releasing our findings, as well as our models and our training dataset, we aim to contribute to the
ongoing evolution of VLMs and their applications in solving complex real-world problems.

A.1.1
Cross-attention vs. fully-autoregressive architectures

We apply LoRA modules to the LLM for the fully autoregressive architecture and to the cross-
attention modules and the LLM for the cross-attention architecture. In Figure 4, we report the average
performance with respect to the number of steps, the number of images, as well as the number of text
tokens. We see an improvement across the board with the fully autoregressive architecture. Comparing
the average score with these different axes is essential because the cross-attention architecture feeds a
single token per image to the language model, against 64 for the fully autoregressive architecture with
perceiver pooling. This implies that for the same training sequence length, the number of images and
text tokens is different for the two architectures. Equivalently, the same multimodal document will
yield different sequence lengths. Even though we fix the batch size in the comparison, the number of
text tokens and number of images grow at different paces under the two architectures.

of steps, the number of images and the number of text tokens.

A.1.2
Comparing various vision backbones

We present in Table 10 the detailed results of comparing multiple vision backbones. While EVA-CLIP-
5B performs similarly to SigLIP-SO400M, we emphasize that it has 11 times more parameters. We
also noticed in early experiments that TextVQA is the most sensitive benchmark to image resolution,
which accounts for the performance increase.

A.1.3
Comparing various pooling strategies

We compare multiple pooling strategies: a simple linear layer that takes the flattened sequence of
vision hidden states and projects it into a shorter sequence of visual tokens, as well as a Mapping
Network (Mañas et al., 2023). The perceiver resampler significantly outperforms these two options
(see Table 11).

We also ablate the number of layers in the perceiver resampler, and find no statistically significant
differences when increasing the number of layers, similarly to results from Xiao et al. (2024). We
settle on 3 layers out of caution to avoid any potential capacity bottleneck.

Finally, we add a 2-layer modality projection MLP on top of the vision encoder hidden states to
project the vision hidden dimension to the language model hidden dimension prior to the perceiver
resampler. These changes yield better performance as well (see Table 13).

Ablations on OCR data

We hypothesize that adding PDF documents helps the model learn to read text from images. In Table 7,
we compare checkpoints trained with and without OCR documents, along with image resolution
increase to ensure that the text is legible. We do not observe statistically significant differences when
evaluating checkpoints in zero or few shot. Instead, we fine-tune the checkpoints on DocVQA for
500 steps with a learning rate of 1e −5, leading to checkpoints showing much stronger differences.

A.1.5
Statistical significance of the experiments

In the context of large-scale experiments, this paper does not include error bars due to the high
costs and time demands of multiple runs; each experiment can take as long as five days on eight
nodes containing eight H100s each. Nevertheless, we conducted multiple runs for some experiments
and observed differences of less than one point in the average score across all cases. This minimal
variation supports the validity of the conclusions drawn from our ablation studies.

Details of the evaluations

A.3.1
Evaluation setup

We perform all evaluations with a batch size of 1 and greedy decoding.

For the multi-choice questions in MMMU, MathVista, MMBench, we evaluate with the same prompt
used for similar types of datasets during the instruction fine-tuning:

Question: {question}
Choices:
A. {choice_a}
B. {choice_b}
C. {choice_c}
...
Answer with the letter.

For the open-ended questions in TextVQA, DocVQA, and VQAv2, we evaluate with the prompt:

Question: {question}
Give a very brief answer.

We use the stop words Question, User, <end_of_utterance> and <eos> to stop a generation.

A.3.2
Expanded evaluation table

We report the expanded evaluation of Idefics2 and the comparison to other models in Table 15.
This includes scores on VQAv2 (Goyal et al., 2017), which is widely adopted for evaluation. We
acknowledge, though, that the metric used for the open-ended visual question answering benchmarks
strongly penalizes models that do not generate in the same format as the ground truth. For example,
answering "large" when the ground truth is "big" or more verbose reformulations will be counted as
incorrect. Our manual qualitative analysis reveals that on benchmarks like VQAv2, the generations
of two models differing by 5 points would be barely noticeable. This problem is less concerning for
other open-ended benchmarks like TextVQA or DocVQA which require finding a text in an image,
making the expected answer less prone to ambiguity. The detailed performance of Idefics2 across
each category of MMMU (Yue et al., 2024) is present in Table 16.

We show in Figures 5, 6, and 7, examples of generations with Idefics2-chatty.

Prompt

Describe the image

Idefics2 output

The image depicts a surreal scene where 
three robot soldiers are standing on a street 

in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Each robot 
soldier is equipped with a large cannon that 
resembles a giant bread roll. The robots are 
facing towards the right side of the image, 

and they appear to be ready for action. The 
sky above them is filled with clouds, and 
there's a red light visible in the distance. The 
overall atmosphere of the image is quite 
unusual, combining elements of technology 

and architecture in an unexpected way.

Figure 6: Idefics2-chatty describes an AI-generated image.

A.4
Limitations

Our research highlights significant advancements in VLMs, yet several limitations persist.

25


---Page Break---
Prompt

What happens to fish if pelicans increase?

Idefics2 output

If pelicans increase, they may 

consume more fish, which could lead 

to a decrease in the fish population 

or an imbalance in the ecosystem. 

This could potentially affect other 

species that rely on fish for food, 

such as seals, dolphins, and humans 

who fish for consumption.

Figure 7: Idefics2-chatty answers a question on a scientific diagram.

Notably, current VLMs, including Idefics2, are prone to hallucinations, often generating content by
describing nonexistent elements in images or fabricating facts. This issue underscores the challenges
in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of model outputs.

Furthermore, the development of these models is slowed down by the lack of openly available,
large-scale pre-trained vision encoders and comprehensive human-created instruction datasets with
long answers for fine-tuning. Such resources are crucial for advancing VLMs, especially those
optimized for conversational applications.

Additionally, as discussed in Section A.5, our models can be manipulated or "jailbroken" to produce
outputs that are non-inclusive or disrespectful. This vulnerability highlights the importance of
continuing to improve the robustness and ethical alignment of VLMs to prevent misuse and ensure
they contribute positively in diverse applications.

A.5
Red-teaming

In the context of a red-teaming exercise, our objective is to evaluate the propensity of the model to
generate inaccurate, biased, or offensive responses. We evaluate more specifically the chat-optimized
checkpoint12.

While the model typically refrains from responding to offensive inputs, we observe that through
repeated trials or guided interactions, it tends to hastily form judgments in situations necessitating
nuanced contextual understanding, often perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Noteworthy instances
include:

• Speculating or passing judgments, or perpetuating historical disparities on individuals’
professions, social status, or insurance eligibility based solely on visual cues (e.g., age, attire,
gender, facial expressions).

• Generating content that promotes online harassment or offensive memes reinforcing harmful
associations from a portrait, or from a benign image.

• Assuming emotional states or mental conditions based on outward appearances.

• Evaluating individuals’ attractiveness solely based on their visual appearance.

Additionally, we identify behaviors that increase security risks that already exist:

• Successfully solving CAPTCHAs featuring distorted text within images.

• Developing phishing schemes from screenshots of legitimate websites to deceive users into
divulging their credentials.

---Page Break---
• Crafting step-by-step guides on constructing small-scale explosives using readily available
chemicals from common supermarkets or manipulating firearms to do maximum damage.

It’s important to note that these security concerns are currently limited by the model’s occasional
inability to accurately read text within images.

We emphasize that the model would often encourage the user to exercise caution about the model’s
generation or flag how problematic the initial query can be in the first place. For instance, when
insistently prompted to write a racist comment, the model would answer that query before pointing
out "This type of stereotyping and dehumanization has been used throughout history to justify
discrimination and oppression against people of color. By making light of such a serious issue, this
meme perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to the ongoing struggle for racial equality
and social justice.".

However, certain formulations can circumvent (i.e. "jailbreak") these cautionary prompts, empha-
sizing the need for critical thinking and discretion when engaging with the model’s outputs. While
jail-breaking text LLMs is an active research area, jail-breaking vision-language models have re-
cently emerged as a new challenge as vision-language models become more capable and prominent
(Shayegani et al., 2024). The addition of the vision modality not only introduces new avenues
for injecting malicious prompts but also raises questions about the interaction between vision and
language vulnerabilities.

A.6
Licenses

A.6.1
License for the models

The model is built on top of two pre-trained models: SigLIP-SO400M (Zhai et al., 2023) and Mistral-
7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023). Both were released under the Apache 2.0 license, and we release the
Idefics2 checkpoints under the same license.

A.6.2
License for the Cauldron

Each of the publicly available sub-datasets present in the Cauldron are governed by specific licensing
conditions. Therefore, when making use of them, you must take into consideration each of the
licenses governing each dataset. To the extent we have any rights in the prompts, these are licensed
under CC-BY-4.0.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss limitations of our work in Section A.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We accurately describe our model architecture, the setups of our experiments,
including the hyperparameters, and the data used for the training, in Section 4. We release the
model and our training data as open-source resources, making the evaluations reproducible.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

29


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We train our model on open datasets only. We also release the dataset we
built during this work as an open-source resource. Our model is integrated in the library
Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020). The code to use the model is therefore available online.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We specify the splits of the evaluations in Table 8 and Table 9. We describe
the hyperparameters, the optimizer, number of epochs and details throughout the paper, and
particularly in section 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present information about the statistical significance of the experiments in
Section A.1.5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

30


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide information on the computer resources in Section 3 for each
ablation and in Section 4.1 for the training of the final model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reviewed and applied the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: By releasing our model, we identify behaviors that increase security risks
(although they already exist), and we discuss them in Section A.5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

31


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Section A.5, we discuss the potential risks of our model. We release the
demo of our model with a system prompt teaching the model to be respectful, polite and
inclusive. The dataset we release is a combination and modification of selected existing
datasets which do not contain unsafe images.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the references section, we acknowledge all prior work we use in this paper.
Moreover, the licenses of our model and dataset are present in Section A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

32


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We release our model and dataset with a model card and a dataset card
explaining how to use these assets. Moreover, we provide additional resources, like a
Google Colab to fine-tune our model, or quantized versions of our model, as helpful tools
for the community.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

33


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
