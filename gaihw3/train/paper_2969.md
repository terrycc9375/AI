Abstract

We consider Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX), a framework for efficiently
selecting evaluation points of an expensive function to infer a property of interest
encoded as the output of a base algorithm. Since the base algorithm typically
requires more evaluations than are feasible, it cannot be directly applied. Instead,
BAX methods sequentially select evaluation points using a probabilistic numer-
ical approach. Current BAX methods use expected information gain to guide
this selection. However, this approach is computationally intensive. Observing
that, in many tasks, the property of interest corresponds to a target set of points
defined by the function, we introduce PS-BAX, a simple, effective, and scalable
BAX method based on posterior sampling. PS-BAX is applicable to a wide range
of problems, including many optimization variants and level set estimation. Ex-
periments across diverse tasks demonstrate that PS-BAX performs competitively
with existing baselines while being significantly faster, simpler to implement, and
easily parallelizable, setting a strong baseline for future research. Additionally, we
establish conditions under which PS-BAX is asymptotically convergent, offering
new insights into posterior sampling as an algorithm design paradigm.

Introduction

Many real-world problems can be cast as estimating a property of a black-box function with expensive
evaluations. Bayesian optimization (BO) [1] has focused on the case where the property of interest is
the function’s global optimum. Similarly, level set estimation [2] deals with the problem of estimating
the subset of points above (or below) a user-specified threshold.

In many cases, an algorithm to compute the property of interest is available, which we refer to as
the base algorithm. However, this algorithm typically requires more evaluations than are feasible in
practice and cannot be used directly. Instead, evaluation points must be carefully selected through
other means. Similar to BO and level set estimation, the Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX)
framework selects evaluation points using two key components: (1) a Bayesian probabilistic model
of the function and (2) a sequential sampling criterion that leverages this model to choose new points
for evaluation [3].

Existing approaches to BAX rely on expected information gain (EIG) as the criterion for selecting
which points to evaluate [3]. However, maximizing the EIG presents a significant computational

challenge, particularly in high-dimensional problems or when the property of interest is complex. As
a result, heuristic approximations are frequently employed, which can lead to suboptimal performance
and limit the applicability of BAX in real-world scenarios.

To address this challenge, we propose PS-BAX, a simple yet effective and scalable approach based
on posterior sampling. Our approach is built upon the key observation that many real-world BAX
tasks aim to find a target set. For instance, in BO, the goal is to locate the function’s global optimum,
while in level set estimation, the objective is to find the points whose function value is above a
specified threshold. PS-BAX only requires a single base algorithm execution at each iteration, making
it much faster than EIG-based approaches, which require executing the base algorithm multiple
times and optimizing over the input space. Despite its simple computation, we show that PS-BAX
is competitive with existing baselines while being significantly faster. Additionally, we show that
it enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that PS-BAX is asymptotically
convergent mild regularity conditions.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We derive PS-BAX, a posterior sampling-based BAX method applicable to a broad class of
BAX problems, unlocking new applications and offering a fresh perspective on the scope of
posterior sampling algorithms.
• We show that PS-BAX is orders of magnitude faster to compute than the EIG-based approach
INFO-BAX [3] while remaining competitive with this and other specialized algorithms.
• We prove that PS-BAX is asymptotically convergent under mild regularity conditions.

Related Work

Our work falls within the broader field of probabilistic numerics [4], which frames numerical
problems, such as optimization or integration, as probabilistic inference tasks. This probabilistic
perspective enables uncertainty quantification, which is particularly important in settings with limited
computational budgets, where budget allocation must be carefully planned, often adaptively. While
much of the recent work in probabilistic numerics has focused on (Bayesian) optimization [1, 5],
there have also been efforts in other areas, including integration (Bayesian quadrature) [6–8], level
set estimation [2, 9], and solving differential equations [10, 11].

Recently, [3] proposed INFO-BAX, an approach to estimate an arbitrary property of interest that
could be computed by a known base algorithm. Since the base algorithm requires a potentially large
number of function evaluations, it cannot be applied directly. Instead, following the probabilistic
numerics paradigm, a Bayesian probabilistic model of the function is used to iteratively select new
points to evaluate. At each iteration, the next evaluation point is chosen by maximizing the expected
information gain (EIG) between the function’s value at the point and the property of interest. Similar
EIG-based approaches have been employed in statistical design of experiments [12–14] and BO [15–
17], often yielding excellent performance. However, these methods are computationally demanding
due to the look-ahead nature of the EIG computation. Moreover, in most cases, the EIG cannot
be computed in closed form and must be approximated via Monte Carlo sampling. As a result,
EIG-based approaches are mainly useful in low-dimensional settings or when function evaluations
are highly expensive, limiting their applicability in real-world problems.

In response to the limitations of EIG-based approaches, we explore an alternative family of strategies
known as posterior sampling or Thompson sampling [18, 19]. Posterior sampling algorithms have
been widely used in BO [20–22], multi-armed bandits [23–25], and reinforcement learning [26–
28]. In such settings, these approaches select a point at each iteration according to the posterior
probability of being the optimum. To our knowledge, our work represents the first extension of
posterior sampling beyond optimization settings, offering fresh insights into this algorithmic family.
While the range of problems our approach can address is narrower than those that EIG-based methods
can conceptually tackle, it still encompasses a substantial class. Notably, this includes the problems
explored empirically by [3] and follow-up work [29], among others.

Our work aligns with recent efforts to broaden the applicability of BO to complex real-world
problems. Many such problems deviate from classical optimization formulations, exhibiting diverse
structures such as combinatorial [29], robust [30, 31], or multi-level optimization [32]. Traditional
BO algorithms often fail to naturally accommodate these structures, limiting their practical utility. We

Bayesian Algorithm Execution via Posterior Sampling

Problem Setting
Our work takes place within the Bayesian algorithm execution (BAX) framework
introduced by [3]. The goal is to estimate OA(f), the output of a base algorithm A applied to a
function f : X →R. We assume that f is expensive to evaluate, which means that employing A
directly on f is infeasible (as it would require evaluating f too many times). Instead, we select the
points at which f is evaluated sequentially, aided by a probabilistic model described below. We
specifically focus on problems where the property of interest can be encoded by a set OA(f) ⊂X,
which we term the target set. As we shall see later, our framework encompasses a wide range of
problems, including BO2, level-set estimation, shortest-path finding on graphs, and top-k estimation,
with applications to topographic estimation and drug discovery.

Probabilistic Model
Similar to many probabilistic numerical methods, our algorithm relies on a
probabilistic model encoded by a prior distribution over f, which we denote by p. Although our
framework is more general and can be used with other priors, we assume for concreteness that f
follows a Gaussian process (GP) prior [36]. Let Dn−1 = {(xk, yk)}n−1
k=1 denote the data collected
after n −1 evaluations of f. We assume these evaluations are corrupted with i.i.d. Gaussian noise,
i.e., yk = f(xk) + ϵk, where ϵ1, . . . , ϵn−1 are i.i.d. with common distribution N(0, σ2), and σ2 is a
non-negative scalar. Under these assumptions, the posterior distribution over f given Dn−1, denoted
by p(f | Dn−1), is again a GP whose mean and covariance functions can be computed in closed form
using the classical GP regression equations.

INFO-BAX and its Shortcomings
Before introducing our algorithm, we briefly comment on prior
work based on the expected information gain (EIG) [3]. Succinctly, the INFO-BAX approach pro-
posed by [3] selects at each iteration the point that maximizes the expected entropy reduction between
the function’s value at the evaluated point and OA(f). Evaluating an expectation is generally difficult,
and one often resorts to Monte Carlo sampling. Moreover, computing the EIG specifically requires
expensive calculations of conditional posterior distributions and entropy. These computational issues
are also present in similar information-theoretic acquisition functions proposed in the classic BO
setting. However, for BAX tasks, the computation burden of EIG can be much more pronounced if
|OA(f)| is large. This occurs, for example, in the level set estimation setting, where OA(f) can be
comprised of a large number of points. We defer a more detailed discussion of the computation of the
EIG to Appendices A and B .

PS-BAX
To overcome the computational limitations of EIG-based approaches, we introduce a
simple strategy based on posterior sampling, which we term PS-BAX. For ease of exposition, we only
describe the fully sequential version of our algorithm and defer the batched (parallelized) version
to Appendix C. Our algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. PS-BAX is comprised of two steps,
detailed below.

2To reduce to standard BO, one can define the target set OA(f) as the points x ∈X that maximize f, i.e.,
OA(f) = argmaxx∈Xf(x) (often a singleton set).

Figure 1: Depiction of PS-BAX (Algorithm 1) for the level-set estimation problem. We plot the
objective function f (black line), the current available data Dn−1 (black points), the threshold (grey
dashed line), the posterior distribution p(f | Dn−1) (blue line and light blue region), a sample from
the posterior ˜fn ∼p(f | Dn−1) (green line), the corresponding sampled target set Xn = OA( ˜fn)
(green region) (this is the set of inputs where the green line is above the threshold), the variance of
p(f | Dn−1) (green line, bottom row), and the next point to evaluate selected by PS-BAX xn ∈Xn
(input marked by the vertical red line). The key step is computing the target set Xn using the sampled
function ˜fn, which generalizes posterior sampling for standard BO.

1. We sample a target set Xn ⊂X according to the posterior probability that Xn = OA(f)
(lines 2-3 in Algorithm 1). This can be achieved by drawing a sample from the posterior
over f, denoted by ˜fn (line 2), and then setting Xn = OA( ˜fn) (line 3).
2. We select the point in the sampled target set Xn with maximal uncertainty or en-
tropy: xn ∈argmaxx∈XnH[f(x)|Dn] (line 4 in Algorithm 1).
For a Gaussian pos-
terior, xn can be equivalently selected using the maximal posterior standard deviation:
xn ∈argmaxx∈Xnσn(x), where σn(x) is the posterior standard deviation of f(x).

Note that the second step is unnecessary in standard BO, since Xn is typically a singleton.

Depiction for Level Set Estimation
Figure 1 depicts an iteration of PS-BAX for the level-set
estimation problem, where OA(f) := {x ∈X | f(x) > τ}, for a user-specified value of τ. Line 3 of
Algorithm 1 returns a target set Xn based on where the sampled function ˜fn (green line in Figure 1)
is above the threshold τ (green region in Figure 1). Line 4 of Algorithm 1 then chooses the point
xn ∈Xn that has maximal uncertainty (red line in Figure 1). In the standard BO setting where A is
computing the maximizer of f, the target region Xn is simply a singleton point where the sampled ˜f
has highest value (and Line 4 in Algorithm 1 is not necessary).

Discussion
We now provide an intuitive explanation of why one might expect PS-BAX to perform
well. In the standard BO setting, posterior sampling is known to deliver excellent performance
[20, 37] and enjoys strong theoretical guarantees [18, 20]. Like in the BO setting, the intrinsic goal
of posterior sampling in our setting is to balance exploration and exploitation. In our case, this means
selecting points for which, according to our probabilistic model, membership in the target set is
still highly uncertain among the likely candidates. To achieve this, the first step of PS-BAX selects
a random set Xn, according to the probability of this set being the target set, in the same vein as
traditional posterior sampling in the BO setting (the set of likely candidates). Unlike in BO, however,
the target set is, in principle, comprised of several points, and thus, we must come up with a criterion
to choose one. To overcome this, the second step simply selects the point with the highest uncertainty
among points in Xn, which is a standard strategy in the active learning literature [38].

Computational Efficiency
PS-BAX requires running A only once on a single sample of f, con-
tributing to its practicality and scalability. Furthermore, similar to posterior sampling in the standard

---Page Break---
BO setting, PS-BAX avoids the need to maximize an acquisition function over X, a process that
is computationally expensive because it involves calculating the expected value of quantities like
information gain. As demonstrated in our experiments, this makes PS-BAX significantly faster than
INFO-BAX [3], particularly in problems where either OA(f) or X are large.

Convergence of PS-BAX
A natural question is under which conditions is PS-BAX able to find the
target set given enough evaluations. We address this question below. Before stating our results, we
introduce a definition related to the characterization of problems where PS-BAX converges.
Definition 1. A target set estimated by an algorithm A is said to be complement-independent if, for
any pair of functions f, f ′ : X →R, it holds that OA(f) = OA(f ′) whenever there exists a set S
such that OA(f) ∪OA(f ′) ⊂S and f(x) = f ′(x) for all x ∈S.

Many target sets of interest, such as a function’s optimum or level set, are complement-independent.
Indeed, the value of f at points that are not the optimum or that do not lie in the level of interest
do not influence these properties. Theorem 1 below shows that PS-BAX enjoys Bayesian posterior
concentration, provided the target set of interest is complement-independent. Intuitively, this result
means that if f is drawn from the prior used by our algorithm (i.e., the prior is well-specified), then,
with probability one, the posterior will concentrate around the true target set. Corollary 1 gives
an asymptotically consistent estimator of the target set. Finally, we also show there are problems
where the target set is not complement-independent and PS-BAX is not asymptotically consistent in
Theorem 2. The proofs of these results can be found in Appendix D.
Theorem 1. Suppose that X is finite and that the target set estimated by A is complement-independent.
If the sequence of points {xn}∞
n=1 is chosen according to the PS-BAX algorithm, then, for each
X ⊂X, limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = 1{OA(f) = X} almost surely for f drawn from the prior.
Corollary 1. Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 1 hold, and let Tn ∈argmaxX⊂XPn(OA(f) =
X). Then, for f drawn from the prior, we have Tn = OA(f) for all sufficiently large n almost surely.
Theorem 2. There exists a problem instance (i.e., X, a Bayesian prior over f, and A) such that if the
sequence of points {xn}∞
n=1 is chosen according to the PS-BAX algorithm, then there is a set X ⊂X
such that limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = 1/2 almost surely for f drawn from the prior.

Numerical Experiments

We evaluate the performance of PS-BAX on eight problems across four problem classes. For each
problem class, we specify the base algorithm used. We compare the performance of PS-BAX against
INFO-BAX [3] and uniform random sampling over X (Random). When available, we also include an
algorithm from the literature specifically designed for the problem class. Additional implementation
details of the algorithms are described in Appendix E. In all experiments, an initial dataset is generated
by sampling 2(d + 1) inputs uniformly at random from X, where d denotes the dimensionality of X.
Following this initialization, each algorithm sequentially selects additional batches of points. Unless
stated otherwise, the batch size is set to q = 1. The performance of each algorithm is determined
by applying A on µn, the posterior mean of f given Dn and subsequently computing a suitable
performance metric on OA(µn). Each experiment was replicated 30 times, with plots showing mean
performance plus and minus 1.96 standard errors. Code to reproduce our experiments is available at
https://github.com/RaulAstudillo06/PSBAX.

Summary of Findings
Overall, we find that PS-BAX is always competitive with and sometimes
significantly outperforms INFO-BAX across all of our experiments. Additionally, as shown in Table 1,
PS-BAX can be orders of magnitude faster in wall-clock runtime. PS-BAX outperforms INFO-BAX
on five out of eight problems, offering particularly large improvements in the Local Optimization
and DiscoBAX problem classes. Moreover, in the Local Optimization and Level Set Estimation
problems, PS-BAX also outperforms algorithms from the literature specifically designed for such
problem classes. On the simpler problems, such as those in the Top-k problem class, PS-BAX is
competitive with INFO-BAX while still being significantly faster.

use of a deep kernel GP model.

its gradients) can be evaluated at a large number of points. Examples of such algorithms include
evolutionary algorithms [39], trust-region methods [40], and many gradient-based optimization
algorithms [41, 42]. This setting reduces to the classical BO setting if A can recover the global
optimum of f. In such case, the INFO-BAX reduces to the classical predictive entropy search
acquisition function [16] when computed exactly and to the joint entropy search acquisition function
[43] under the approximation proposed by [3] that we use in our experiments. PS-BAX, in turn,
reduces to the classical posterior sampling strategy used in BO [20]. However, due to its practical
relevance and the lack of an empirical comparison between joint entropy search and posterior
sampling, we still include this setting in our experiments. We also use this setting to illustrate nuances
that arise when choosing a base algorithm.

In our experiments, we use a gradient-based optimization method as a base algorithm instead
of an evolutionary algorithm as pursued by [3]. Gradient-based methods typically exhibit faster
convergence than their gradient-free counterparts. However, they are often infeasible if gradients
cannot be obtained analytically and instead are obtained, e.g., via finite differences. Since in most
applications, analytic gradients of f are unavailable, directly applying such methods on f is infeasible.
However, PS-BAX and INFO-BAX can make use of gradient-based methods thanks to the availability
of gradients of most probabilistic models used in practice, including GPs.

We consider the Hartmann and Ackley functions, with input dimensions of 6 and 10, respectively,
as test functions. Both functions have many local minima and are standard test functions in the
BO literature. For Ackley, we set the batch size to q = 2. As a performance metric, we report
the log10 inference regret, given by log10(f ∗−f(ˆx∗
n)), where ˆx∗
n is obtained by applying A on
µn. The results of these experiments are depicted in Figure 2. As a baseline, we also include the

Level Set Estimation

Level set estimation involves finding all points in X with f(x) > τ, for a user-specified threshold
value τ. This task arises in applications such as environmental monitoring, where a mobile sensing
device detects regions with dangerous pollution levels [2], and topographic mapping, where the goal
is to infer the portion of a geographic area above a specified altitude using limited measurements [44].
For both problems considered in our work, X is finite; therefore, the base algorithm A simply ranks
all objective values and returns the points where the function value exceeds the threshold.

We evaluate the algorithms on a synthetic problem (the 2-dimensional Himmelblau function) and a
real-world topographic dataset, consisting of 87 × 61 height measurements from a large geographic
area around Auckland’s Maunga Whau volcano [44]. The threshold τ is set to the 0.55 quantile of all
function values in the domain for both problems. An illustration of single runs on the topographic
problem over 100 iterations for both INFO-BAX and PS-BAX is shown in Figure 4.

The performance metric used is the F1 score, defined by

F1 =
2TP
2TP + FP + FN ,
(1)

where TP, FP, and FN represent true positives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 3. As an additional baseline specifically designed
for level set estimation, we include the popular LSE algorithm proposed by [2]. PS-BAX demonstrates
strong performance, outperforming all benchmarks in the topographic mapping problem.

4.3
Top-k Estimation

We consider the top-k estimation setting, where X is a finite (but potentially large) set, and the goal is
to identify the k points with the largest values of f(x). In this scenario, the base algorithm evaluates
f at all points in X and returns the k best points. Following [3], we use as performance metric the
Jaccard distance between the estimated output Sn = OA(µn) and the ground truth optimal set S∗,
defined by

d(Sn, S∗) = 1 −|Sn ∩S∗|

|Sn ∪S∗|.

We consider two test problems. The first problem uses 3-dimensional Rosenbrock function, a standard
benchmark in the optimization literature. The input space is obtained by taking a uniform grid of
1,000 points over [−2, 2]3. For this problem we set k = 4.

The second problem is a real-world top-k (k = 10) selection task in protein design, where the
goal is to maximize stability fitness predictions for the Guanine nucleotide-binding protein GB1,

given different sequence mutations in a target region of 4 residues [45]. GB1 is well-studied by
biologists, and its domain is known to be highly rugged, dominated by "dead" variants with very low
fitness scores [46]. There are 204 possible combinations, with 20 amino acids and 4 positions, and
we represent the input space X as one-hot vectors in an 80-dimensional space. To avoid excessive
runtimes, we randomly sample 10,000 points from the original dataset. Due to the high dimensionality,
vast input space, and sparse fitness landscape, this dataset poses significant challenges for standard
GP models. Therefore, we use a deep kernel GP [47] as our probabilistic model. Given the dataset’s
size, we perform batched evaluations with batch size of q = 4 for both PS-BAX and INFO-BAX.

The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 5. In both problems, PS-BAX performs
comparably to INFO-BAX, with both algorithms significantly outperforming Random.

DiscoBAX: Drug Discovery Application

As a final application, we consider the DiscoBAX problem setting from [29] in the context of drug
discovery, where the task is to identify a set of optimal genomic interventions to determine suitable
drug targets. Formally, let X represent a pool of genetic interventions, and for each x ∈X, let f(x)

denote an in vitro phenotype measurement correlated with the effectiveness of genetic intervention x.
The effectiveness of the intervention is assumed to be f(x) + η(x), where η(x) captures noise and
other exogenous factors not reflected in the in vitro measurement. Following the setup in [29], we
simulate η using a GP with mean 0 and an RBF covariance function. The goal is to identify a small
set of genomic interventions in X that maximize an objective function balancing two characteristics:
high expected change in the target phenotype and high diversity to maximize success in subsequent
stages of drug development. This is formalized in [29] as the following optimization problem:

max
S⊂X:|S|=k Eη


max
x∈S f(x) + η(x)

,
(3)

where k is the desired size of the intervention set. This problem aims to find a set of interventions
S such that the best-performing intervention in S has the highest expected effectiveness (over η).
Solving Equation 3 exactly is challenging due to its combinatorial nature, even if could evaluate f
many times, but a computationally efficient approximation is possible by leveraging the submodularity
of the objective function. For more details on the base algorithm, we refer the reader to [29].

Following [29], we use the tau protein assay [48] and interferon-gamma assay [49] datasets from
the Achilles project [50]. Originally, the gene embeddings in this dataset are represented as 808-
dimensional vectors, and a Bayesian MLP is used as the probabilistic model instead of a GP. To
reduce dimensionality, we preprocess the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then
fit a GP to the lower-dimensional representation. Additionally, we truncate the dataset to the 5000
genes with the highest intervention values to ensure computational feasibility in our experiments. The
results of these experiments are shown in Figure 6. PS-BAX significantly outperforms INFO-BAX,
whose performance is only marginally better than that of Random.

Conclusion

Many real-world problems involve estimating the output of a base algorithm applied to a black-box
function with costly evaluations. While the INFO-BAX algorithm proposed by [3] offers a solution,
it faces practical limitations. In response, we introduced PS-BAX, a novel posterior sampling strategy
built upon the observation that, in many cases, the algorithm’s output can be characterized as a target
set of input points. Our experiments demonstrate that PS-BAX is not only competitive with previous
approaches but also significantly faster to compute. Moreover, we established conditions under which
PS-BAX is asymptotically convergent.

Looking ahead, our approach provides a pathway to extend the success of Bayesian optimization to
a broader range of problems, potentially unlocking new and impactful applications. Additionally,
PS-BAX serves as a robust baseline for future research aimed at developing tailored strategies for
specific domains. Furthermore, our findings offer new perspectives on posterior sampling algorithms
and their application scope, suggesting several promising avenues for future exploration in this area.

Computation of the Expected Information Gain

Let E and H denote the expectation and (differential) entropy operators, respectively. At each
iteration n, the expected information gain between the OA(f) and a new observation of f at x,
denoted by yx, can be written as

EIGn(x) = H[yx | Dn] −E[H[yx | Dn, OA(f)] | Dn].
(4)

Under the probabilistic model established above, the conditional distribution of yx given Dn is
Gaussian, allowing the analytical computation of H[yx | Dn]. However, in most cases, H[yx |
Dn, OA(f)] cannot be computed analytically. In particular, this is true in our setting, where OA(f)
is a subset of X.

To address this challenge, [3] introduced an approximation where OA(f) is replaced by a set of pairs
(x′, f(x′)) for inputs x′ evaluated when A is applied on f. When OA(f) is a subset of X, a natural
choice is to take all inputs x′ ∈OA(f). This coincides with the approximation used by [3] in the
optimization and top-k estimation settings. The corresponding approximation of EIGn, denoted by
EIGv
n, is then given by

EIGv
n(x) = H[yx | Dn] −E[H[yx | Dn, {(x′, f(x′)) : x′ ∈OA(f)}] | Dn].
(5)

The advantage of this approximation is that, again, H[yx | Dn, {(x′, f(x′)) : x′ ∈OA(f))} can be
computed analytically under a Gaussian posterior.

The expectation E[H[yx | Dn, {(x′, f(x′)) : x′ ∈OA(f)}] | Dn] still requires to be approximated
via Monte Carlo sampling. Concretely, this can be achieved by drawing L samples from the posterior
over f given Dn, denoted by ˜fn,1, . . . , ˜fn,L, and setting

EIGv
n(x) ≈H[yx | Dn] −1

L

L
X

ℓ=1
H[yx | Dn, {(x′, f(x′)) : x′ ∈OA( ˜fn,ℓ)}].
(6)

This is the approximation of EIGn that we use in our experiments in Section 4, i.e., at each iteration,
we set xn to be a point that maximizes the expression in Equation 6.

Computational Complexity of PS-BAX and INFO-BAX

Given a Gaussian process posterior, we analyze the computational complexity of selecting the next
evaluation point for both PS-BAX and INFO-BAX. Our analysis excludes the cost of generating a
sample from the posterior, which is fixed and depends only on the number of Fourier features used.
We also assume that the cost of evaluating such a sample at any given point is 1, as is the cost of
evaluating the posterior mean and covariance. Additionally, we assume that the function domain X is
discrete with |X| = N, the algorithm output has a fixed cardinality |OA(f)| = M, the number of
execution paths to approximate the posterior entropy is L, and running the algorithm on any input
function requires P evaluations. As we show next, the computational cost of INFO-BAX can be
significantly higher than that of PS-BAX when N, M, or L is large.

For PS-BAX, the complexity is O(P + M), reflecting the cost of running the algorithm once on
a single function sample and maximizing the posterior variance over the sampled target set. For
INFO-BAX, the complexity is O
 
(P + M 3 + N · M 2) · L

. For each function sample, we need to
execute the algorithm (P), condition on M new points to compute the conditional entropy (M 3),
and evaluate the posterior variance of the fantasized model on N points (N · M 2). This process is
repeated for L function samples.

C
Batch Extensions of PS-BAX and INFO-BAX

In this section, we discuss extensions of the PS-BAX and INFO-BAX algorithms to the batch setting,
where at each iteration, we generate q new points for evaluation, denoted by xn,1, . . . , xn,q. These
extensions are inspired by batch versions of the posterior sampling algorithm [20] and the joint
entropy search acquisition function [43] from BO. Figure 7 illustrates the performance of PS-BAX
under various batch sizes in two of our test problems.

Batch PS-BAX
We extend PS-BAX to the batch setting, following the approach proposed by [20].
For a batch size of q, we draw q independent samples from the posterior on f, denoted by ˜f1, . . . , ˜fq,
and define the set Xn = ∪q
i=1OA( ˜fn,i). We then select the points xn,1, . . . , xn,q ∈Xn iteratively by
choosing the point in Xn with the highest posterior entropy, conditioned on the previously selected
points, as follows:

xn,1 = argmaxx∈Xn H[f(x) | Dn],
...
xn,q = argmaxx∈Xn H[f(x) | Dn ∪{xn,1, . . . , xn,q−1}]

Batch INFO-BAX
INFO-BAX can be naturally extended to the batch setting by considering
the EIG over a batch of q points. However, directly optimizing the EIG in this scenario involves
optimizing over Xq, which is usually computationally prohibitive. To address this, we use a greedy
optimization approach. Specifically, we select xn,1, . . . , xn,q iteratively by maximizing the EIG
conditioned on the previously selected points, as follows:

xn,1 = argmaxx∈XH[yx | Dn] −E[H[yx | Dn, OA(f)] | Dn],
...
xn,q = argmaxx∈XH[yx | Dn ∪{xn,1, . . . , xn,q−1}]
−E[H[yx | Dn ∪{xn,1, . . . , xn,q−1}, OA(f)] | Dn ∪{xn,1, . . . , xn,q−1}].

D
Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2

We begin by introducing the following notation. Let Fn denote the σ-algebra generated by Dn−1, and
let F∞denote the minimal σ-algebra generated by the sequence {Fn}∞
n=1. We denote the conditional
probability measures induced by Fn and F∞as Pn and P∞, respectively.

Proof of Theorem 1

Before proving Theorem 1, we establish an auxiliary lemma. Both Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 assume
the prior distribution and likelihood discussed in Section 3. In particular, this implies that for each
x ∈X, the posterior distribution of f(x) given Fn is Gaussian, with mean and standard deviation
denoted by µn(x) and σn(x), respectively.

Lemma 1. Suppose that X is finite, and let S∞= {x ∈X : ∃X ⊂X s.t. x ∈X ∧P∞(OA(f) =
X) > 0}. Then, both S∞and the image of f over this set are F∞-measurable.

Proof. Clearly, the set S∞is F∞-measurable. Thus, it suffices to show that for each x ∈S∞, f(x)
is F∞-measurable.

Let x ∈S∞. By definition, there exists a subset X ⊂X such that P∞(OA(f) = X) > 0. Moreover,
a standard martingale argument shows that limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = P∞(OA(f) = X) almost
surely. Consequently, there exists ϵ > 0 such that Pn(OA(f) = X) > ϵ for all sufficiently large n,
implying that the event Xn = X occurs infinitely often.

It is not hard to see that σn(x) →0 as n →∞if x is selected infinitely often. Furthermore,
since xn = argmaxx′∈Xnσn(x′), X is finite, and Xn = X occurs infinitely often, it follows that
σn(x′) →0 as n →∞for each x′ ∈X, and in particular for x. By Proposition 2.9 in [51], it
follows that µn(x) →f(x). Since µn(x) is F∞-measurable for each n, it follows that f(x) is
F∞-measurable for each x ∈S∞.

Theorem 1. Suppose that X is finite and that the target set estimated by A is complement-independent.
If the sequence of points {xn}∞
n=1 is chosen according to the PS-BAX algorithm, then for each X ⊂X,
limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = 1{OA(f) = X} almost surely for f drawn from the prior.

Proof. Recall that limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = P∞(OA(f) = X) almost surely. Thus, it remains
to show that P∞(OA(f) = X) = 1{OA(f) = X} almost surely.

Let S∞be defined as in Lemma 1.
Since X is finite, by the definition of S∞, it follows
that P∞(OA(f) ⊂S∞) = 1. Moreover, by the law of iterated expectation, it also holds that
P(OA(f) ⊂S∞) = 1.

Since OA(f) is complement-independent, it is fully determined by the values of f over S∞whenever
OA(f) ⊂S∞. By Lemma 1, we know that both S∞and the image of f over this set are F∞-
measurable. Therefore, for any fixed X ⊂X, we have {OA(f) = X} ∩{OA(f) ⊂S∞} ∈F∞,
and hence, P∞(OA(f) = X, OA(f) ⊂S∞) = 1{OA(f) = X}1{OA(f) ⊂S∞}.

Finally, since P(OA(f) ⊂S∞) = P∞(OA(f) ⊂S∞) = 1, we conclude that P∞(OA(f) = X) =
1{OA(f) = X} almost surely.

D.2
Proof of Theorem 2

Theorem 2. There exists a problem instance (i.e., X, a Bayesian prior over f, and A) such that if the
sequence of points {xn}∞
n=1 is chosen according to the PS-BAX algorithm, then there is a set X ⊂X
such that limn→∞Pn(OA(f) = X) = 1/2 almost surely for f drawn from the prior.

Proof. Let X = {−1, 0, 1}, and consider a GP prior over f such that f(−1) = f(1) = 0 and f(0) is
a standard normal random variable. Define the algorithm A such that OA(f) = {−1} if f(0) < 0
and OA(f) = {1} otherwise. Clearly, the target set defined by A is not complement-independent.
Moreover, under the PS-BAX algorithm, xn is always either −1 or 1. Since the values of f at these
points are known, the posterior distribution over f at any iteration n remains equal to the prior.
Therefore, it follows that Pn(OA(f) = {−1}) = Pn(OA(f) = {1}) = 1/2 for all n.

Implementation Details

All our algorithms are implemented using BoTorch [33].
Specifically, we use BoTorch’s
SingleTaskGP class with its default settings for all our GP models, except in the top-k GB1
problem, where we employ a deep kernel GP. To fit our GP models, we maximize the marginal
log-likelihood. Approximate samples from the posterior on f for both PS-BAX and INFO-BAX are
generated using 1000 random Fourier features [52]. Our implementations of PS-BAX and INFO-BAX
support automatic gradient computation, enabling continuous optimization when X is continuous.
For INFO-BAX, we use L = 30 Monte Carlo samples to estimate the EIG across all problems.

NeurIPS paper checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Abstract and Sections 4 and 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See the discussion about the limitations of our theoretical result in Section 4.3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

16


---Page Break---
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4.3 and Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: A thorough discussion of the details of our empirical evaluation can be found
in Section 5 and Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often

17


---Page Break---
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the code and data necessary to reproduce our experiments as a part
of the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: These details are discussed in Section 5.
Guidelines:

18


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our performance plots include error bars reporting ±1.96 standard errors
across 30 trials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the average runtime for each algorithm across every test problem.
Unfortunately, the exact details of the computing resources used are not available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: We read this code and verified that our research was performed under such
lineaments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The dataset used in our simulated exoskeleton design is discussed in Section
5.3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

---Page Break---
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification:
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
