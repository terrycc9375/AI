Abstract
Single-image relighting is a challenging task that involves reasoning about the
complex interplay between geometry, materials, and lighting. Many prior methods
either support only specific categories of images, such as portraits, or require special
capture conditions, like using a flashlight. Alternatively, some methods explicitly
decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as normals and BRDFs, which
can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end
2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer1, that takes a single image of
any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel
environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on
a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method
builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting
dataset, revealing and harnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present
in the diffusion model. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild
Internet imagery and demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and
accuracy. Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model
enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object
insertion. Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such
as relighting a radiance field.

Introduction

Lighting plays a key role in our visual world, serving as one of the fundamental elements that
shape our interpretation and interaction with 3D space. The interplay of light and shadows can
highlight textures, reveal contours, and enhance the perception of shape and form. In many cases,
there is a desire to relight an image—that is, to modify it as if it were captured under different
lighting conditions. Such a relighting capability enables photo enhancement (e.g., relighting portraits
[18; 67]), facilitates consistent lighting across various scenes for filmmaking [59; 22], and supports
the seamless integration of virtual objects into real-world environments [38; 19].

However, relighting single images is a challenging task because it involves the complex interplay
between geometry, materials, and illumination. Hence, many classical model-based inverse rendering
approaches aim to explicitly recover shape, material properties, and lighting from input images [2;
75; 47; 83; 87], so that they can then modify these components and rerender the image. These
methods often require multi-view inputs and can suffer from: 1) model limitations that prevent
faithful estimation of complex light, materials, and shape in real-world scenes, and 2) ambiguities in
determining these factors without strong data-driven priors.

To circumvent these issues, image-based relighting techniques [18; 72; 76] avoid explicit scene
reconstruction and focus on high-quality image synthesis. However, some image-based methods

Figure 1: Single-image relighting results on real data. Neural Gaffer supports single-image relighting for
various input images under diverse lighting conditions, using either image-conditioned input (i.e., an environment
map) or text-conditioned input (i.e., a description of the target lighting). These results demonstrate our model’s
capability to adapt to diverse lighting scenarios while preserving the visual fidelity of the original objects.
Our relighting results remain consistent with the lighting rotating. Please see the supplementary webpage for
additional video results produced from real input images.

[18; 58; 76; 44; 3] require inputs under multiple lighting conditions or even sophisticated capture
setups (e.g., a light stage [18]), while recent deep learning-based techniques [67; 51; 89] enable
single-view relighting but often work only on specific categories like portraits.

In this paper, we propose a novel category-agnostic approach for single-view relighting that tackles
the challenges mentioned above. We introduce an end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, named
Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object as input and synthesizes an accurate and
high-quality relit image under any environmental lighting condition, specified as a high-dynamic
range (HDR) environment map. In contrast to previous learning-based single-view models that are
trained for specific categories, we leverage powerful diffusion models, trained on diverse data, and
enable relighting of objects from arbitrary categories. Unlike prior model-based approaches, our
diffusion-based data-driven framework enables the model to learn physical priors from an object-
centric synthetic dataset featuring physically-based materials and High Dynamic Range (HDR)
environment maps. This facilitates more accurate lighting effects compared to traditional methods.

Our model exhibits superior generalization and accuracy on both synthetic and real-world images
(See Fig. 1). It also seamlessly integrates with other generative methods for various 2D image editing
tasks, such as object insertion. Neural Gaffer also can serve as a robust relighting prior for neural
radiance fields, facilitating a novel two-stage 3D relighting pipeline. Hence, our diffusion-based
solution can relight any object under any environmental lighting condition for both 2D and 3D tasks.
By harnessing the power of diffusion models, our approach generalizes effectively across diverse
scenes and lighting conditions, overcoming the limitations of prior model-based and image-based
methods.

Diffusion models. Recently, diffusion-based image generation models [26; 49] have dominated
visual content generation tasks. Stable Diffusion [60] not only generates impressive results in the
text-to-image setting, but also enables a wide range of image applications. ControlNet [84] adds
trainable neural network modules to the U-Net structure of diffusion models to generate images

conditioned on edges, depth, human pose, etc. Diffusion models can also change other aspects of
an input image [45; 9], such as image style, via image-to-image models [52]. ControlCom [80] and
AnyDoor [14] are image composition models that can blend a foreground object into a target image.
Huang et al. provide a comprehensive review of diffusion-based image editing [28].

Recent work has also shown that, despite being trained on 2D images, other kinds of information
can be unlocked from diffusion models. A notable example is Zero-1-to-3 [42], which uncovers 3D
reasoning capabilities in Stable Diffusion by fine-tuning it on a view synthesis task using synthetic
data, and conditioning the model on viewpoint. Similar to the spirit of Zero-1-to-3 and its follow-up
work (such as [63; 27]), our work unlocks the latent capability of diffusion models for relighting.

Single-image relighting. Relighting imagery is a difficult task that requires an (explicit or implicit)
understanding of geometry, materials, lighting, and their interaction through light transport. Single-
image relighting is especially challenging due to its ill-posedness; there are infinite explanations of a
single image in terms of underlying factors. Classic single-image methods, like SIRFS [2], focus
on explicit estimation of scene properties, via optimization with hand-crafted priors. More recent
learning-based methods can learn such priors from data, but either focus on specific image types,
such as outdoor scenes [73; 69; 78; 40; 21], portraits [53; 71; 64; 67; 48; 51; 23; 56], or human
bodies [31; 37; 29], or require special capture conditions like camera flash [39; 61]. Single-image
relighting methods for general objects, with realistic appearance, materials, and lighting, remain
elusive. In addition, most recent single-image relighting methods [51; 39; 61; 12] still explicitly
decompose an image into components, then reconstruct it with modified lighting. This strategy allows
the components to be explicitly controlled, but also limits their realism based on the representational
ability of the chosen components, such as the Disney BSDF [11] or Phong reflection model [10]. In
contrast, similar to [67; 79], we achieve object relighting without an explicit scene decomposition.
By training an image-based and lighting-conditioned diffusion model, we can relight any given object
from a single photo.

3D relighting and inverse rendering. Inverse rendering methods involve estimating 3D models that
can be relit under different lighting conditions, typically from multiple images. Recent advances in
3D, such as NeRF [46] and 3D Gaussian Splatting [32], have shown remarkable novel view synthesis
results. However, these representations are not themselves relightable as the physical light transport is
baked into the radiance field. Efforts have been made toward creating relightable 3D representations,
such as PhySG [83], NeRFactor [87], TensoIR [30] and others [6; 8; 7; 5; 4; 82; 88; 35; 66; 77; 81].
These methods often rely on pure optimization to minimize a rendering loss, sometimes incorporating
hand-crafted material and/or lighting regularization terms (e.g., smoothness or sparsity) to prevent
overfitting. However, these approaches often struggle with specular highlights and glossy materials.
We show that our proposed Neural Gaffer method can be applied in an inverse rendering framework,
serving as a powerful prior and regularizer. This is because our model has been trained on a large
dataset encompassing diverse lighting and material conditions, effectively learning these priors from
high-quality data. Our model improves 3D relighting quality, while baselines tend to produce artifacts
due to the baking of lighting information into the color field.

Method

Neural Gaffer is a generalizable image-based 2D diffusion model for relighting general objects; we
finetune a pretrained image-conditioned diffusion model [42] with a synthetic relighting dataset to
fulfill this goal. In Sec. 3.1, we describe how we construct a large-scale high-quality relighting dataset
from Objaverse [20]. Then, in Sec. 3.2, we discuss the design and training of a 2D diffusion model
to support zero-shot single-image relighting. Finally, we showcase applications of our model in
downstream tasks, including 2D object insertion and 3D radiance field relighting tasks.

3.1
RelitObjaverse Dataset

Capturing ground-truth lighting for real object images is both time-consuming and challenging.
Existing real-world relighting datasets [41; 36; 70] are constrained to a very limited number of
objects. To address this limitation, we opt to render a large-scale synthetic object relighting dataset.

We use Objaverse [20] as our data source, which comprises about 800K synthetic 3D object models of
varying quality. To avoid 3D object models with poor geometry or texture, we developed a series of

3


---Page Break---
filtering mechanisms. Specifically, we first utilize a classifier trained on a manually annotated subset
to categorize and filter out the 3D objects with low geometry and texture quality. In addition, we also
design a set of filtering rules based on 3D object attributes, such as geometry bounding boxes, BRDF
attributes, and file size, eventually yielding a subset (of ∼90K objects) of the original Objaverse
with high quality. To ensure abundant lighting variations, we collected 1,870 HDR environment
maps from the Internet, and augmented them with horizontal flipping and rotation, resulting in ∼30K
different environment maps in total.

We render images with the Cycles renderer from Blender [17]. During rendering, we randomly
sample 12 camera poses for each object. For each viewpoint, we render 16 images under different
environment maps. In contrast to existing datasets that only render with environment maps [16; 62],
we additionally render an image under a randomly set area light source to increase lighting diversity.
In total, for each object, there are 12 × (16 + 1) = 204 images rendered under different lighting
conditions and from different viewpoints. Our final synthetic relighting dataset has about 18.4M
512 × 512 rendered images with ground-truth lighting. We will release our full relighting dataset,
named the RelitObjaverse dataset, upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

3.2
Lighting-conditioned 2D Relighting Diffusion Model

Given a single object image x ∈RH×W ×3 and a new lighting condition E ∈RH′×W ′×3 (represented
as an HDR environment map), our goal is to learn a model f that can synthesize a new image ˆxE
with correct appearance changes under the new lighting, while preserving the object’s identity:
ˆxE = f(x, E).
(1)
We fine-tune an image-to-image diffusion model using our rendered data. In particular, we adopt the
pre-trained Zero-1-to-3 model [42] and discard its components and weights relevant to novel-view
generation, repurposing the model for relighting. To incorporate lighting conditions, we extend the
input latents of the diffusion model, concatenating the encoded input image and the environment
map with the denoising latent. We introduce two design decisions that are critical for the effective
integration of lighting into the latent diffusion model.

Environment map rotation. In general, each pixel of an environment map E corresponds to a
3D direction in the absolute world coordinate frame, whereas our relighting is performed in image
space, that is, locked to the camera’s coordinate frame. Therefore, we need a way for a user to
specify the relationship between the environment map and camera coordinate frames. One option is
to concatenate the relative 3D rotation to the embedding, similar to how Zero-1-to-3 [42] encodes
the relative camera pose for the novel view synthesis task. However, we observe that such a design
makes it harder for the network to learn the relighting task, perhaps because it needs to interpret the
complex relationship between 3D rotation parameters and the desired rotated lighting. Our solution
is instead to rotate the target environment map to align with the target camera coordinate frame, prior
to feeding it to the model. After rotation, each pixel of the rotated environment map corresponds to a
fixed lighting direction in the target camera coordinate frame.

HDR-LDR conditioning. Pixel values in the HDR
environment map have a theoretical range of [0, +∞),
and large pixel values can lead to unstable diffusion
training. To rescale it to [0, 1.0], a naive idea is to
divide it by its maximum value, but this leads to a
loss of total energy information. Also, if the map
has a very bright region (e.g., the sun), then most
of the other values will approach 0 and the environ-
ment map will be too dark after division, causing
a loss of lighting detail. To solve this, we split the
HDR environment map E into two maps: EL is an
LDR representation of E, computed via standard
tone-mapping [57; 24], and EH is a nonlinearly nor-
malized representation of E, computed by a logarith-
mic mapping and divided by the new maximum value.
EL encodes lighting detail in low-intensity regions,
which is useful for generating relighting details(such
as reflection details). EH maintains the lighting in-
formation across the initial spectrum. Inputting EL

Figure 3: Relighting a 3D neural radiance field. Given an input NeRF and a target environmental lighting, in
Stage 1, we use Neural Gaffer to predict relit images at each predefined camera viewpoint. We then tune the
appearance field to overfit the multi-view relighting predictions with a reconstruction loss. In Stage 2, we further
refine the appearance of the coarsely relit radiance field via the diffusion guidance loss. Using this pipeline, we
can relight a NeRF model in minutes.

and EH together to the diffusion model means that the network can reason effectively about the
full original energy spectrum. Additionally, our design helps to achieve a balanced exposure in the
generated output, preventing areas from appearing too dark or too washed out after normalization
due to extreme brightness.

Diffusion model architecture and training. Our latent diffusion model comprises an encoder E,
a denoiser U-Net ϵθ, and a decoder D. During each training iteration, given the paired input-target
images x and ˆxE, and the target lighting condition E, we (1) rotate E into the target camera coordinate
frame based on the specified lighting direction, forming a rotated map ˆE; (2) transform ˆE into an
LDR environment map ˆEL and a normalized HDR environment map ˆEH; (3) and finally, encode
ˆEL, ˆEH and the input image x with the encoder E. The concatenation of the encoded latent maps are
used to condition the denoising U-Net ϵθ. Fig. 2 depicts our 2D relighting system. We fine-tune the
latent diffusion model with the following objective:

where t ∼[1, 1000] is the diffusion time step, ˆE = {E(x), E( ˆEL), E( ˆEH)} represents the union of
encoded latents for x, ˆEL and ˆEH, and c(x) represents the CLIP embedding of the input image x.
Example 2D relighting results from our trained model, applied to real images, are shown in Fig. 1.

3.3
Relighting a 3D radiance field with diffusion prior guidance

We can utilize Neural Gaffer as a prior for 3D relighting. In particular, given a 3D neural radiance
field consisting of a density field Gσ and a view-dependent appearance field Ga [46], we consider
the task of relighting it using our 2D relighting diffusion model as a prior. We find that simply
relighting the input NeRF with the popular Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method [55] leads to
over-saturated and unnatural results, as shown in Fig. 8. We instead propose a two-stage pipeline
(Fig. 3) to achieve high-quality 3D relighting in minutes. In the first stage, we use our 2D relighting
diffusion model to relight input views and overfit the original NeRF’s appearance field, giving us
coarsely relit renderings at sampled viewpoints. In the second stage, our model is used to further
refine the appearance details with a diffusion loss and an exponential annealed multi-step scheduling.

Stage 1: Coarse relighting with reconstruction loss. Given a NeRF with parameters ψ, the multi-
view input images xinput = {xi}N
i=1 and the target lighting Etarget, we first use our diffusion model f
to generate multi-view relighting prediction images ˆxrelit = {ˆxi}N
i=1, where ˆxi = f(xi, Etarget).

Then, we freeze the density field Gσ of the NeRF, and only optimize the appearance field of the
input NeRF with reconstruction loss Lrecon., aiming to minimize the reconstruction error between a
rendered image x = x(ψ, πinput) and the relit image xrelit at pose πinput:

Lrecon.(ψ) = ∥(x(ψ, πinput) −xrelit)∥2
2.
(3)

After this stage, we get an initial blurry and noisy relighting result.

Stage 2: Detail refinement with diffusion guidance loss. The results from the first stage can be
blurry and can exhibit noise because the multi-view relighting predictions results may be inconsistent.

---Page Break---
We further refine the relit NeRF’s appearance in Stage 2. We found that directly using the SDS
loss [55] for refinement leads to noisy and over-saturated results (see Fig. 8). Inspired by [68; 74; 45],
we treat the blurry rendered images from Stage 1 as an intermediate denoising result. We first render
an image ˆx under the sampled camera pose πsampled. We encode and perturb it to a noisy latent ˆzt(ˆx, t⋆)
with an intermediate noise level t⋆, and initiate the multi-step DDIM [65] denoising process for
ˆzt(ˆx, t⋆) from t⋆, yielding a latent sample ˆz0. This latent is decoded to an image ˆxrelit(t⋆) = D( ˆz0),
which we use to supervise the rendering with the following diffusion guidance loss:

Ldiff(ψ) = w1∥ˆx −ˆxrelit(t⋆)∥1 + w2Lp(ˆx, ˆxrelit(t⋆)),
(4)

where Lp is the perceptual distance LPIPS [86] and w1 and w2 are scale factors to balance the two
terms. We exponentially decrease t⋆during optimization.

Experiments

4.1
Implementation details

Diffusion model training. We fine-tune our model starting from Zero123’s [42] checkpoint and
discard its original linear projection layer for image embedding and pose. We only fine-tune the UNet
of the diffusion model and freeze other parts. During fine-tuning, we use a reduced image size of
256 × 256 and a total batch size of 1024. Both the LDR and normalized HDR environment maps
are resized to 256 × 256. We use AdamW [43] and set the learning rate to 10−4 for training. We
fine-tune our model for 80K iterations on 8 A6000 GPUs for 5 days.

3D relighting. Given a neural radiance field reconstructed from multi-view inputs (we use Ten-
soRF [13]), we first freeze its density field and then optimize the input NeRF’s appearance field for
2,500 iterations in Stage 1, with a ray batch size of 4096. In Stage 2, we set the initial timestep t⋆to
decrease from 0.4 to 0.05 exponentially. w1 and w2 in Eqn. 4 are set to be 0.5 for all of our test cases.
We optimize the results from Stage 1 for 500 iterations, and for each iteration, we sample one view to
compute the diffusion guidance loss in Eqn. 4. Stage 1 takes about 5 minutes and Stage 2 takes about
3 minutes on a single A6000 GPU.

Downstream 2D tasks. Our model supports downstream 2D image editing tasks, such as text-
based relighting and object insertion. For text-based relighting, given a text prompt, we first use
Text2Light [15] to generate an HDR panorama, and, using that as an environment map, relight images
using our diffusion model. Fig. 1 (right two columns) shows example results; more are on our project
webpage. For object insertion, given an object image and a target (perspective) scene image, we
segment the foreground object with SAM [34], estimate lighting from the target background image
with DiffusionLight [54], perform relighting, and finally generate a shadow attached to the object
using [50]. Our workflow can preserve the object’s identity and achieve high-quality visual quality.

4.2
Baselines and metrics

We use common image metrics including PNSR, SSIM, and LPIPS [86] to evaluate relighting results
quantitatively. In addition, since there exists an ambiguity between lighting intensity and object
color, we also compute channel-aligned results as in [87; 88], where each channel of the relighting
prediction is rescaled to align the average intensity with the ground-truth. We compute metrics for
both the raw and the channel-aligned results for quantitative evaluation.

For the single-image relighting task, there are very few prior works that can handle general objects
under natural illumination. We compare to a very recent work DiLightNet [79], which trains a lighting-
conditioned ControlNet [84] to relight images, which is achieved by conditioning its ControlNet
with a set of rendered images using predefined materials, estimated geometry of the input image,
and target lighting. Per our request, the authors ran their model on our validation data. We select
48 high-quality objects from Objaverse as validation objects, which are unseen during training. We
render each object under 4 different camera poses. For each camera, we randomly sample 12 unseen
environment maps to render the target relit images, and one additional environment map to render
the input. We also compare with IC-Light [85]. Since our lighting conditioning is different from
its setting (they use background images), we only provide qualitative comparisons in our appendix
and project webpage. For relighting 3D radiance fields, we compare with two 3D inverse rendering
methods: TensoIR [30] and NVDIFFREC-MC [25]. We select 6 objects from the NeRF-Synthetic

dataset [46] and Objaverse [20] for testing. For each object, 100 camera poses are sampled to generate
training images and 20 camera poses are sampled for testing images. Each pose is rendered under four
distinct, previously unseen environmental lighting conditions. One lighting condition is designated
for training images, while the remaining three are reserved for relighting testing.

4.3
Results analysis

Comparing single-image relighting with DiLightNet [79]. As shown in Fig. 4, we evaluate across a
diverse set of unseen objects and unseen target lighting conditions. Our approach showcases superior
fidelity to the intended lighting settings, maintaining consistent color accuracy and preserving intricate
details. Compared with DiLightNet [79], our model can generate more accurate highlights, shadows,
and high-frequent reflections. These results demonstrate our model’s ability to accurately understand
the underlying physical properties of the object in the input image, such as geometry and materials,
and faithfully reproduce the desired relighting appearance. Quantitative results are in Tab. 1.

Single-image relighting on real data. We evaluate our single-image relighting model on a set of real-
world input photos (Fig. 1), under either image-conditioned (environment map) or text-conditioned
(text description of the desired target lighting) target illumination. As shown in the figure, our model
effectively adapts to diverse lighting conditions and produces realistic, high-fidelity relighting results
under novel illumination. In addition, our relighting results are consistent and stable with the lighting
condition rotating. Please refer to our webpage to get more video results of more real data.

models for downstream 2D tasks, like object insertion. In Fig. 5, we take a foreground image
containing the object of interest and insert the object into a background image depicting the desired

of the inserted objects and synthesizing more natural illumination, seamlessly integrating objects into
the background scene.

MC), bake the original highlights (TensoIR), or produce artifacts (NVDIFFREC-MC and TensoIR). In contrast,
our method implicitly learns to model the complex interplay of light and materials from the training process
of our relighting diffusion model, resulting in more accurate relighting results with fewer artifacts. Video

Given an input radiance field(NeRF) representing a 3D object, we first tune NeRF for coarse relighting
in Stage 1, followed by a finer relighting result in Stage 2 that improves fidelity. We also compared to
conventional inverse rendering methods such as NVDIFFREC-MC [25] and TensoIR [30], reporting
quantitative results in Tab. 2 and showing qualitative comparisons in Fig. 6 and Fig. 13.

As ablations, we evaluated different lighting condition-
ing designs for our diffusion model: 1) only inputting
one environment map rather than both the rotated LDR
and normalized HDR map, and 2) controlling the light-
ing direction by adding the relative 3D rotation between
the default environment map coordinate frame and the
target camera frame to the U-Net CLIP embedding
branch without rotating the environment maps explicitly.
Due to limited computational resources, when performing ablations for the model design, we train
the different models with 2 A6000 GPUs for 48K iterations. We provide a quantitative comparison
between them in Tab. 3 and a qualitative comparison in Fig. 7, showcasing the effectiveness of our
design. As shown in Fig 7, controlling the lighting direction by only adding the relative 3D lighting
rotation to the U-Net CLIP embedding branch can’t get the relighting results with correct lighting
directions for all testing cases. Without inputting the LDR map, the model fails to generate the

highlights for the third test case. Only when both the LDR and HDR maps are provided can the model
accurately reason about the full original energy spectrum and generate correct relighting results for
the second test case. Our full model achieves the best results across different ablation experiments.

Figure 9: Limitation Analysis. The left side shows the encoding-decoding results using the VAE [33] in our
base diffusion model [1; 42]. These results indicate that the VAE struggles to preserve identity for objects with
fine details at low resolution (256 × 256), which in turn affects the performance of our model on such objects.
On the right side, we present several failed cases of our method in Objaverse instances.

second sofa scene, or remove shadows in the third hotdog scene. Stage 1 ensures overall relighting
accuracy, while Stage 2 helps reduce noise and leads to more detailed results. Without Stage 1, we
cannot generate the correct specular highlight for the first scene, and the details of the shadows on the
sofa scene’s backrest become noisy and less accurate. Without Stage 2, the appearance of the relit
scenes becomes noisier and blurrier, especially in the sofa scene. Replacing our diffusion guidance
loss (Eqn. 4) in Stage 2 with an SDS loss results in unnatural, noisy, and over-saturated relighting.
Our full model consistently produces the most accurate and visually realistic results across all test
variants. Please zoom in to see detailed differences across ablation variants.

Limitations

While our model can achieve overall consistent relighting results under rotating or changing lighting
conditions, our results can still exhibit minor inconsistencies since the model is generative.

Given the high resource demands of data preprocessing (specifically, rotating the HDR environment
map) and model training, and considering our limited university resources, we trained the model at a
lower image resolution of 256 × 256. In Fig. 9, we use VAE [33] in our base diffusion model [1; 42]
to encode input images into latent maps, and then directly decode them. We found that VAE struggles
to preserve identity for objects with fine details even from latent maps encoded from the input images
at this resolution, which in turn results in many relighting failure cases at this resolution. Finetuning
our model at a higher resolution will greatly help solve this issue.

We observe two key failure cases when relighting Objaverse Instances, as shown on the right side of
Fig. 9. First, our model struggles with color ambiguity in diffuse objects, leading to inaccuracies in
relit colors (first row). This issue arises from inherent ambiguities in the input image, where color
could be attributed to either material or lighting. Including the background of the input image may
help the model better infer the lighting conditions of input images and address this challenge. We give
more discussions in the Appendix. C. Second, while the model generates low-frequency highlights
well, it often misses high-frequency reflections in relit images (second row).

In addition, we discuss our limitations regarding portrait relighting in the Appendix. B.

Conclusion

We proposed an end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, Neural Gaffer, that addresses the long-
standing challenge of single-image relighting through a data-driven framework. Our model synthe-
sizes accurate and high-quality relighted images from a single input image under any environmental
lighting condition, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy on both synthetic and real-
world datasets. Neural Gaffer not only enhances various 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting
and object insertion but also serves as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, enabling a simplified
two-stage 3D relighting pipeline. By overcoming the limitations and ambiguities of traditional
model-based inverse rendering approaches, our diffusion-based solution extends the applicability of
relighting techniques to a broad range of practical applications.

Comparison with IC-Light

In this section, we conduct a comparison with a recent single-image relighting method, IC-Light [85].
In Fig. 10, we present a comparative analysis of relighting results, focusing on the consistency
of specular highlights in comparison to IC-Light. Our method consistently adjusts the specular
highlights in accordance with the rotation of the lighting, ensuring a coherent relighting effect. In
contrast, IC-Light demonstrates inconsistent movement of highlights, with certain regions showing
minimal changes. For additional video comparisons, please visit our supplemental webpage.

Figure 10: Comparison of single-image relighting with IC-Light [85]. In this experiment, we compare
relighting results and evaluate the consistency of specular highlights against IC-Light [85]. Each column
represents a uniformly rotated version of the same environment map image, progressing from left to right. Our
method consistently adjusts highlights, faithfully reproducing the object under novel lighting conditions. In
contrast, IC-Light [85] exhibits inconsistent highlight movement, with certain regions changing just slightly.
Further comparisons are available in videos provided on the supplemental webpage.

Portrait Relighting Results

Our model is fine-tuned on object data, therefore, while it is category-agnostic, it might not achieve
the highest quality results on specific domains—for instance, for the case of portrait relighting,
methods that are specifically trained for portrait photos may produce higher quality results. We show
our results on the portrait in Fig. 11 of the appendix.

Figure 11: Human portrait relighting results. Overall, in most cases, our method shows good generalization
to human portraits (see the second row of the figure above). However, there are instances where it produces
suboptimal results. For example, in the first row, the model fails to remove the shadow on the neck in the input
image. In the failure case shown in the last row, the model does not preserve critical portrait details, such as
the shape of the mouth. This issue may stem from the low-resolution limitations discussed in Sec. 5. Further
fine-tuning with additional portrait data and at a higher resolution could enhance the model’s performance on
portrait images.

Figure 12: Color ambiguity analysis. We found that our data-driven model can handle the inherent color
ambiguity to some extent, especially when the objects’ materials in the input image are relatively specular.
Because the diffusion model can infer the lighting of the input image through the reflections or specular highlights

Color ambiguity is an inherent issue in the single-image relighting task. That said, we found that our
data-driven model can handle this problem to some extent, especially when the objects’ materials in
the input image are relatively specular. Because the diffusion model can infer the lighting of the input
image through the reflections or specular highlights. In Fig. 12, we show two such examples: we
render each object with two different environment maps and relight them with the same environment
map. In both cases, the input images have different colors and we want to relight them under the
same target lighting. It turned out that both input images can be relit to the results that match the
ground truth results, which indicates our model has some ability to handle the color ambiguity.

As for the general diffuse object, we think our model could learn an implicit prior over common
colors that show up in object albedos, as well as common colors that occur in lighting, and use that
to help resolve this ambiguity. However, this may fail sometimes, as we discussed in Sec.5. One
potential solution could be also inputting the background of the input image to the diffusion model
since the diffusion model can learn to infer the lighting of the input image from the background. We
leave this as future work.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main focus of this paper is to train a lighting-aware image-conditioned
diffusion model; it aligns with our title.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the Limitation Section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have included enough details to reproduce our results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will release all code and models once upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we have described in details our experimental setups in the experiments section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: As each experiment takes significant amount of compute resource, we don’t
have enough computing resources to complete the significance test.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

21


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, provide both data creation and model training.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper is written on our own and follows the honest codes.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Please refer to the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

22


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited all previous papers that lead to our current paper’s presentation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

23


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets were introduced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
