Abstract

Generating simulations to train intelligent agents in game-playing and robotics
from natural language input, from user input or task documentation, remains an
open-ended challenge. Existing approaches focus on parts of this challenge, such
as generating reward functions or task hyperparameters. Unlike previous work,
we introduce FACTORSIM that generates full simulations in code from language
input that can be used to train agents. Exploiting the structural modularity specific
to coded simulations, we propose to use a factored partially observable Markov
decision process representation that allows us to reduce context dependence during
each step of the generation. For evaluation, we introduce a generative simulation
benchmark that assesses the generated simulation code’s accuracy and effectiveness
in facilitating zero-shot transfers in reinforcement learning settings. We show that
FACTORSIM outperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding
prompt alignment (i.e., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation.
We also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks.

Introduction

Simulations hold significant potential for training agents to perform real-world tasks where data
collection is costly, dangerous, or infringes on individual privacy. A major bottleneck in harnessing
the potential of simulations at scale for agent training is the cost of designing and developing
them, especially when we need a distribution of simulations that meet detailed design specifications
to train more generalized policies. In this paper, we aim to generate coded simulations given text
specifications. Code provides a natural interface for users to inspect, modify, and debug the simulation.
It also allows us to craft diverse environments for Reinforcement Learning (RL) purposes.

Generating full simulations in code to train agents from a text prompt is an under-explored challenge.
Previous works focus on parts of this challenge, including reward function design [22], hyperparame-
ter tuning [24], and task configuration while relying on an existing simulator [35]. These methods
use large language models (LLMs) to generate the components of simulations specified as code.
However, when faced with large and detailed contexts, LLMs often generate simulations that ignore
or fail to adhere to parts of the input prompt [21]. This issue is not solely due to the limitations of

Figure 1: Overview of FACTORSIM. FACTORSIM takes language documentation as input, uses Chain-
of-Thought to derive a series of steps to be implemented, adopts a Factored POMDP representation
to facilitate efficient context selection during each generation step, trains agents on the generated
simulations, and tests the resulting policy on previously unseen RL environments.

existing LLMs but also suggests that some form of decomposition is always critical as we scale up
the number of components in simulations. We ask the question: can we exploit the inherent structure
(e.g., having a game loop that handles agent actions, updates internal game states accordingly, and
displays the game states to the users through a rendering process) of coded simulations to generate
them better?

We propose FACTORSIM, a framework that takes an arbitrary language specification as input and
outputs a full simulation that can be used to train RL agents. The key idea of FACTORSIM is to
decompose the input prompt into a series of steps and then use a factored Partially Observable
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) representation to reduce the context needed for each generation
step. To realize FACTORSIM, we use the model-view-controller software design pattern to structure
the generation process. Consider generating a coded simulation of WaterWorld; see Figure 1. The
game consists of an agent (blue circle) traveling in a 2d world, capturing food (green circle) while
avoiding enemies (red circle). Our method first decomposes the game description into multiple
steps to be implemented. For example, a step instruction could be “Introduce red dot enemies that
can be controlled with arrow keys. Give the player a -1 reward when the agent collides with an
enemy”. We first select the context needed for this functionality to be implemented, e.g., positions of
existing agents. Subsequently, FACTORSIM generates (at most) three functions: one to handle player
input (i.e., handle_key_press, the controller component), one to implement the collision logic (i.e.,
collision_logic, the model component), and one to update the rendering function (i.e., render_red_dot,
the view component). Limiting the context during each step of the simulation generation process
allows FACTORSIM to focus on the task at hand while avoiding hallucinating non-existent functions
or modifying code not meant to be changed.

To evaluate the task of full simulation generation, we propose a new Generative Simulation4 bench-
mark with accompanying success metrics. One set of success metrics is the pass rate in automated
system tests. Commonly used in game development, these system tests programmatically assess
whether the behavior of the generated simulation adheres to the specifications given in the input
prompt. The second success metric assesses the value of the generated simulations for transfer learn-
ing in an RL setting. This evaluates how well agents trained on a set of generated simulations can
generalize to held-out environments that satisfy the design specifications provided in prompts. Gen-
eralization to unseen environments is crucial for many applications, including transferring robotics

policies learned in simulation to the real world. This benchmark consists of 8 RL environments with
varying levels of difficulty. In addition to evaluating our method on the benchmark we introduced,
we further assess FACTORSIM’s ability to generate robotic tasks on the dataset published by Gen-
Sim [35]. We demonstrate the value of our method, FACTORSIM, on both the benchmark task suite
and GenSim’s dataset, showing performance superior to baseline alternatives.

In summary, our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose FACTORSIM, a framework for
generating coded simulation with a factor graph of a POMDP as a principled way to reduce context
dependence. Second, we introduce a new generative simulation benchmark by adapting an existing
RL benchmark [33], and demonstrate FACTORSIM’s superior results against baselines in terms of
code correctness (i.e., prompt alignment), ability to facilitate zero-shot generalization and human
evaluation of the simulations. Third, we demonstrate that FACTORSIM can be applied to generating
simulation tasks for robotics, outperforming existing approaches.

Related Work

We aim to generate simulations for training agents to generalize to previously unseen environments.
Recent work has investigated this in the context of learned neural world models and LLM-generated
code for simulations.

World models simulate the dynamics of a given environment and use this as a proxy environment
for agent training, rather than interacting with a ground truth simulator [8]. Several approaches have
demonstrated the value of learning world models as part of general algorithms that can learn to play
a variety of games (AlphaZero [30], Muesli [13], and DreamerV3 [9]). Other efforts use a large
set of offline data to learn a world model that is subsequently used for agent training, including for
autonomous vehicle driving (GAIA-1 [14]), robotic manipulation (UniSim [40]), and 2D platformer
games (Genie [5]). We generate world models as code as they are more interpretable, modular, and
easily modified or extended by humans—key advantages we believe are important for their use in
authoring large-scale or complex simulations.

LLMs have generated many parts of simulations for game playing and robotics. In (RL) games, LLMs
have been used to generate game levels [34, 31], to choose parameters for an existing simulator [44],
and to assist humans in creating full games [3]. In robotics, LLMs have been used to generate
reward functions, task specifications, and specific components like scene configurations within
robotics tasks. Many works such as RoboGen [37], Holodeck [41], and Gen2Sim [16] build on top
of existing simulators and use a series of prompts to generate interactable 3D environments to train
agents. GenSim [35] starts from a human task library and iteratively generates and tests new tasks
to generate robotic manipulation tasks. Other efforts have focused on generating reward functions
for tasks [22, 19, 23]. Eureka [22] uses feedback from agent training to refine reward function
specification. Our approach is able to generate both the simulator dynamics and reward functions and
can be applied to both robotics and games.

As noted above, LLMs can struggle to handle complex tasks: this has prompted research into
different ways to structure LLM reasoning. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting demonstrated
LLM performance can be substantially boosted by prompting the LLM to break a single task
into multiple steps with either few-shot examples [38] or zero-shot [18]. Subsequent work has
developed a variety of techniques to improve LLM reasoning through multi-step reasoning prompts:
checking for consistency among multiple reasoning paths [36], interleaving reasoning and tool use
(ReACT [43]), using tree data structures to guide the LLM reasoning process (Tree-of-Thought [42]),
or formulating reasoning as a tree search process [12, 46]. Approaches for general code generation
include decomposing the task into functions to subsequently generate (Parsel [45]), generating code
to reach a series of intermediate execution states (ExeDec [28]), and using a multi-agent framework
to generate, test, and refine code (AgentCoder [15]). Other efforts optimize the prompts for given
tasks, using evolutionary search (EvoPrompt [7]) or defining generalized declarative programming
frameworks with modular optimization algorithms [17]. Our approach generates code by leveraging
a factorized representation specific to simulations to reduce the input context needed for different
reasoning steps; it can be used in conjunction with approaches for general code generation, such as
generating tests as a form of self verification.

FACTORSIM: Generating Simulations via Factorized Representation

A simulation is a structured system of modules connected by events and responses. Our framework,
FACTORSIM, generates code using LLMs by exploiting this structure to construct a simulation
progressively. Our key insight is that, by generating a simulation step-by-step while only selecting the
relevant context information needed for each step, we can effectively reduce the reasoning capacity
needed for each step, leading to simulations that adhere more closely to the input requirements.

In this section, we describe our method for generating Turing-computable simulations. First, we de-
scribe simulations that can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).
Second, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to decompose an input prompt describing the desired full
simulation into a series of prompts describing different components to be implemented. Third, we
introduce a factorized POMDP representation that exploits the inherent modularity of coded simu-
lations. Refer to Algorithm 1 and Figure for an overview of FACTORSIM alongside an illustrative
example.

3.1
Modeling Simulation as POMDP

A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is used to represent a coded simulation.
Formally a POMDP is represented as a tuple M = ⟨S, A, O, T, Ω, R⟩where S is a set of states, A is
a set of actions, O is a set of observations, T : S × A →∆(S) is a transition probability distribution,
Ω: S →∆(O) is an observation function, and R : S × A × S′ →R is the reward model 5.

We aim to generate a simulation from a prompt Qtext. In this paper, we are particularly interested in
the case where Qtext comprises detailed design specifications such that the resulting simulation could
be used to train agents, though our method applies to any prompt for defining a simulation. In our
experiments, Qtext is a paragraph of text around 10 sentences specifying this simulation.

5We omit the discount factor γ and the initial state distribution π in the formulation for brevity. In our
experiments, π is generated alongside the states S.

Figure 2: An illustrative example of how the five main prompts in FactorSim correspond to our
formulation in Algorithm 1. Note that the function red_puck_respawn is retrieved as part of the
context to Prompt 3, 4, and 5 because it modifies the state variable red_puck_position, a state variable
LLM identified as relevant in prompt 2.

3.2
Chain of Thought

We first decompose the prompt Qtext into a series of steps using Chain of Thought [38], each
describing a module of the simulation to be implemented. Following similar formulation as in [26],
this can be thought of as marginalizing over a step-by-step plan variable (q1, . . . , qk) using N Monte
Carlo samples:

ˆp(M′|Qtext) = 1

N

1 , . . . , q(i)
K ),
where (q(i)
1 , . . . , q(i)
K ) ∼p(q1, . . . , qK|Qtext),
(1)

p is a probability estimation model (i.e., an LLM in our experiments), and M′ is the resulting code
that fully specifies a simulation. In practice, we only produce a single plan N = 1.

Intuitively, this process breaks the prompt into sub-tasks. After we sample such a plan of K steps,
we generate the simulation progressively. Given an existing POMDP M and a natural language
specification q, we update the POMDP to reflect the changes specified.

p(MK+1|q1, . . . , qK) ≈

K
Y

k=1
p(Mk+1|Mk, qk)
(2)

where Mk+1 is the POMDP (simulation as code) after the k-th step is implemented, and MK+1 is
the final simulation. While Chain-of-Thought prompting allows LLMs to avoid having to generate
code for all simulation logic at once, the complexity of each step still grows with k due to the
expanding codebase. This task remains challenging because LLMs must comprehend the code and
accurately identify where modifications are needed. Acknowledging the limited reasoning ability of
LLMs, we ask: can we further decompose the p(Mk+1|Mk, qk) into simpler distributions to reduce
the complexity of each prompt?

3.3
Decomposition by Factorized Representation

Naively, we could further decompose a step of the generation into several steps, each focused on
generating a different component of the POMDP:

p(Mk+1|Mk, qk) =p(Sk+1|Mk, qk)·
(3)
p(Tk+1|Sk+1, Mk, qk)·
(4)
p(Rk+1|Sk+1, Tk+1, Mk, qk)·
(5)
p(Ωk+1|Sk+1, Tk+1, Rk+1, Mk, qk)
(6)

---Page Break---
However, this still requires the LLMs to take the entire simulation (Mk) as context, which could
be over hundreds of lines of code in our experiments. Empirically, we observe that many failed
generations can be attributed to LLMs attending to or modifying parts of the input context unrelated
to the prompt.

To reduce the input context needed for each generation step, we propose to use a factored POMDP
representation to remove the dependence on the full previous POMDP as context. For instance, given
an existing simulation Mk of red, green, and blue agents, to implement the kth-step instruction qk:
respawn the red agent when it collides with the blue agent, we only need context
regarding the respawn logic of the red agent and the positions of the red and blue agents. Code
regarding the green agent or the rendering logic would be unnecessary context.

To formalize our approach, we first introduce notation common to the literature [25, 32]. Suppose
we have a POMDP with a state space factored into n state variables S = S[1] × . . . S[n] and Z is a
subset of indices Z ⊆{1, 2, . . . , n}, we define the scope set S[Z] := N
i∈Z S[i] as the state space
spanned by the subset of state variables. For example, if Z = 1, 3, 4, then S[Z] defines a state space
defined by S[1] × S[3] × S[4]. We denote a state in the scoped state space S[Z] as s[Z]. Below, let
us formally define a factored POMDP.
Definition 3.1. A factored POMDP is a POMDP with both factored transition distribution and
factored reward function. A transition probability distribution T of a POMDP with discrete action
space is factored over its state space S = S1 ×. . . Sn with scopes Z1, . . . , Zm if, for all s ∈S, a ∈A
there exist some {Ti}m
i=1 in the space of all possible transition distributions on the state space S and
action space A, such that,

T(s|s, a) =

m
Y

i=1
Ti (s[i] | s [Zi] , a) .
(7)

A reward function R of a POMDP is factored over S = S1 × . . . Sn with scopes Z1, . . . , Zl if, for
all s ∈S, a ∈A there exist some {Ri}l
i=1 in the space of all possible reward functions on the state
space S and action space A, such that,

R(s, a) =

l
X

i=1
Ri (s [Zi] , a) .
(8)

A factored POMDP can be represented as a factor graph 6 with two types of nodes: state variables
(i.e., Si) and factors (i.e., Ti or Ri), functions of (state) variables. Our idea is to reduce context
dependence by structuring the code using a factored POMDP representation and treat each
generation step as expanding a factored POMDP with new state variables and new factors. During
every step qk, we first select a set of relevant state variable indices Zk. Then, we select existing
factors that have overlapping scope with the selected set of state variables as context, which we
denote as T[Zk] and R[Zk]. That is, we can reduce the dependence on the previous simulation Mk
and rewrite Equation 3-6 to the following:

p(Mk+1|Mk, qk) ≈p(Sk+1|Sk, qk)·
update state space
(9)
p(S [Zk] |Sk+1, qk)·
identify relevant state variables
(10)
p(Tk+1|T[Zk], S [Zk] , A, qk)·
update state transition function
(11)
p(Rk+1|R[Zk], S [Zk] , A, qk)·
update reward function
(12)
p(Ωk+1|S [Zk] , qk).
update partial observation function
(13)

Note that Zk can only consist of state variable indices in the state space Sk+1. In practice, we achieve
this by encouraging the LLM to select a minimal set of relevant states Zk in the prompt.

We find that the term 11 is most prone to error, likely because the most complicated functions of a
simulation are state transitions. Motivated by this observation, we propose to adopt the model-view-
controller design pattern for structuring these prompts. Instead of prompting LLMs to update the
state transition function first and then update the reward function, we prompt the LLMs to update the
action-dependent part of the state transition function (i.e. the Controller component) and then the

action-independent part (i.e., Model). We treat the reward model as part of the state transition function
that updates a score state variable. That is, T(s′|s, a) = T (s)(s′|s)T (a)(s|s, a) where T (a)(s|s, a)
denotes the part of the state transition function that handles how actions affect the states and T (s)(s′|s)
denotes the part of the state transition function that how states are updated every step. This gives us
our final algorithm as illustrated in Algorithm 1.

In Algorithm 1, colors indicate the corresponding components of the model-view-controller pattern.
Red highlights the controller, corresponding to parts of the state transition dependent on user-input
actions.Green shows the model, corresponding to parts of the state transition function that are not
dependent on user-input actions. Blue shows the view component, updating the observation function
that acts as the “renderer” of the state space.

Experiments

In this paper, we consider two types of simulations: 2D Reinforcement Learning (RL) games and
robotics tasks in a physics engine. We also introduce a new benchmark to evaluate generative
simulation methods. Our experiments are designed to test three hypotheses. First, FACTORSIM
generates simulations with better prompt alignment, which we evaluate through system tests and
human evaluations. Second, FACTORSIM enables better zero-shot transfer by training RL agents in
the simulated generated environments. Third, FACTORSIM’s strengths in generating robotic tasks.

4.1
RL Game Generation

To answer our first two hypotheses, we propose a new benchmark that includes all 2D games from the
PyGame Learning Environment 7 [33]: Flappy Bird, Catcher, Puckworld, Pixelcopter, Pong, Snake,
Waterworld, and Monster Kong. For each RL game, the input prompt consists of the game’s online
documentation. Since most game documentation is incomplete, we manually supplement them with
additional details (see Appendix). This ensures that our method and the baselines do not hallucinate
any missing game information, allowing for a fair evaluation across all methods.

Following common practices in game development, we design system tests to verify that the generated
simulations follow the specified logic programmatically. These tests simulate actions like key presses
and mouse clicks and check if the game states are updated correctly. Refer to the Appendix for more
details.

Baselines
For baselines, we compare to three methods using a closed-source (GPT-4 [1]) and an
open-source LLM (Llama-3 [2]). The first approach prompts the LLM with all contexts at once,
which we denote as the vanilla method. The second approach uses self-debugging [6], where the
model retries generating the code when provided error messages from running the code (up to 10
times in our experiments). A third approach combines Chain-of-Thought [38] (CoT) reasoning with
self-debugging, where the LLM generates code incrementally, processing one instruction at a time.
Additionally, we incorporate AgentCoder [15] as a baseline. CoT with self-debugging is an ablation
study of our method that acts without the factored POMDP representation.

7We exclude the sole 3D game Raycast Maze and leave 3D game generation to future work.

methods. Ellipses correspond to 90% confidence intervals for
each algorithm, aggregated over all RL games.

Code Generation Evaluation
Table 1 shows the results for the
baselines and our method. FAC-
TORSIM outperforms all baselines
in 7 out of 8 games. Addition-
ally, we compare performance
and LLM token usage across
various methods using GPT-4
(Figure 3).
While the vanilla
baseline uses the fewest tokens,
it only achieves moderate accu-
racy.
Additionally, combining
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reason-
ing with self-debugging results in
the highest token usage but only
marginally improves accuracy over iterative self-debugging. FACTORSIM achieves the highest ac-
curacy with modest token usage, indicating that the decomposition of tasks reduces the need for
extensive iterative debugging.

Empirically, we find that certain prompts, when tested on baselines without the decomposition
mechanism in FACTORSIM, are prone to syntax or runtime errors that the LLMs cannot self-debug.
This is particularly evident with Llama-3 (vanilla) and Llama-3 self-debug, which perform poorly as
they generate highly similar incorrect implementations, ignoring the logic specified in the prompts
even when the temperature is set to 1. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the model having a
strong prior for how certain games, like Pong and Flappy Bird, should be implemented, ignoring the
prompt specifications. This “mode collapse” issue of LLMs could be caused by over-fitting in the
instruction tuning stage [10].

While AgentCoder iteratively refines code, it performs poorly because it relies on a test designer
agent and a test executor agent to write quality test cases. However, due to the complexity of the
tasks in our benchmark, the test designer agent tends to write incorrect or infeasible tests, leading to
negative feedback. This points to FactorSim being an improvement over the standard "role-based"
Chain of Thought decompositions, and that it is non-trivial to generate simulations from complex
textual specifications.

Zero-shot Transfer Results
Additionally, we test FACTORSIM by training a PPO [27] agent on 10
generated environments for 10 million steps and zero-shot test it on the “ground-truth” environment
implemented in the original RL benchmark (Figure 4). The rewards are linearly scaled such that
0 corresponds to the performance of a random policy and 1 corresponds to the performance of a
PPO agent trained for 10 million steps on the "ground-truth" environment. FACTORSIM achieves
notably better zero-shot transfer results as a result of generating code that adheres more closely to
the prompt specification. We also observe that the errors FACTORSIM made tend to be more spread
out across different components of the simulation. In contrast, many baselines suffer from failure
modes concentrated in a specific aspect of the generation (e.g., incorrectly implementing the collision
logic) that significantly hampers the ability of a set of generations to facilitate zero-shot transfer.

Human Study Evaluation
Automated systems tests cannot holistically capture some aspects of
game playability such as rendering a usable user interface. To address this limitation we conducted a
human study where users were asked to play the generated games and evaluate their playability. Over
320 human evaluations (40 per game) we find FACTORSIM generates more functional and playable
games, compared to the strongest baseline GPT-4 CoT with iterative self-debugging (Figure 5). More
details can be found in the Appendix.

4.2
Robotics Task Generation

We evaluate on GenSim’s [35] 50-task benchmark of robotics tasks in the CLIPort framework [29].
Refer to Figure 6 for an overview of our experimental setting. We compare FACTORSIM with the
best-performing methods in generating code that specifies tasks (object states and reward structure)
that can be used to train robots. Analogous to the game generation experiment, we use FACTORSIM

ated simulations of FACTORSIM and the strongest

gated over all 8 RL games.

Baselines & Metrics
We compare our method
with the multiple GenSim baselines: vanilla
(one-shot), Chain-of-Thought (topdown), and
Chain-of-Thought (bottom-up). Adopting the
same set of metrics, we evaluate all methods
on a sequence of pass rates on “syntax correct-
ness”, “runtime-verified”, and “task completed”.
A generated task is considered “completed” if
a coded oracle agent could collect 99% of the
total reward half of the time.

We empirically found that the "task completion
rate" is an imperfect metric for evaluating the
success of a generated task. A task deemed
"complete" by the oracle agent may fail to ad-
here to the prompt. For example, when asked to
generate a task "build a wheel," a method might
produce a task specification that involves rearranging blocks into a structure that does not resemble a
wheel. To address this, we introduced a metric of the “human pass rate”. This involved manually
inspecting runtime-verified tasks to determine if the task specifications aligned with the prompt
descriptions (see Appendix).

Figure 8: This figure illustrates two input task prompts and the corresponding sequence of subtasks
decomposed by FACTORSIM.

Results & Discussion
FACTORSIM outperforms baselines in generating tasks with a higher runtime
pass rate and better human evaluation scores, indicating improved prompt alignment (Figure 7).
Task completion rates are generally low for all methods due to the limitation of the oracle agent.
For example, tasks like "Build Ball Pit" (fill a container with balls to create a ball pit) often fail
because the balls roll out of the visible area of the oracle agent, not because the generated task is
invalid. FACTORSIM performs particularly well on tasks that specify spatial relationships (e.g., "on
top of," "left of," "outside of") between objects, such as the "build House" example in Figure 8. This
improvement is likely due to the decomposition process, where for each step, instead of addressing
a combination of multiple spatial relations all at once, FACTORSIM attends to a smaller context,
allowing each spatial relation to be addressed separately.

Conclusion & Future Work

We have proposed FACTORSIM as an approach to generate full simulations as code that can train
agents while adhering to detailed design requirements specified as a text prompt. We also introduce a
benchmark suite of eight RL environments to evaluate generative simulation methods.

Generating complex simulations in code is challenging, and we anticipate numerous opportunities
to extend the simulation generation process. There is substantial room to address larger-scale,
more complex games, and robotics environments that require code bases beyond what can be used
effectively in the context window of existing LLMs. We also see great potential to accelerate RL
agent training by generating code that can be accelerated on GPU devices. Our robotic simulation
results will benefit from further investigations to demonstrate transfer to real-world environments.
We have only addressed single-agent simulations, leaving the extension of our method to multi-agent
settings to future work. In the future, we also plan to incorporate information from the agent training
process to automatically modify the generated simulation environment for enhanced agent learning
and generalization. Taken together, we believe the generation of full simulations as code will be an
important step toward enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to support the development of generalized
RL agent policies.

A
Societal Impact

This work can be applied broadly to many types of simulations, including robotics, autonomous
vehicles, and other autonomous systems. Such systems have the potential for both positive and
negative societal impact (e.g., harmful dual use). As researchers, we must critically evaluate such
applications and promote beneficial ones. In this work we have focused on simulations with potential
positive social impact, particularly in supporting the development of robots able to operate in human
environments like households or manufacturing facilities.

The methods we present generate simulations that can be used to train agents to perform tasks.
One risk with generated simulations is for training agents in an unintended manner. By generating
simulations specified as code we mitigate this concern by making the behavior of the simulation
explicit and inspectable by humans. Further, our approach is better able to guide LLMs to generate
code that matches input design specifications compared to baseline methods, reducing the risk of
LLMs inadvertently producing undesirable functionality. We believe this can help enhance the
reliability of generated simulations while offering strong editing and control capabilities to humans.

The potential negative environmental impact of the compute for using our technique is small. We
have shown our technique consumes less tokens than comparable methods to yield equally good
results. Thus our method can be seen as a way to reduce computational needs when using LLMs for
tasks like creating simulations. Compared to systems that use a neural world model our approach
benefits from the relatively lower computational costs of running simulations in code compared to
running large neural models for simulation.

Additional details of our experiments

All experiments are done on a workstation with 8 Nvidia A40 GPUs and 1008G of RAM. For our
code generation experiments, one generation (i.e., generation of one training environment) takes
around 30 seconds to 5 minutes. For our Reinforcement Learning experiments, one trial of training
(i.e. training on a set of environments for 10M steps in total) takes around 3-5 hours to complete. In
all of our experiments, GPT-4 refers to the OpenAI’s “gpt-4-1106-preview” model, GPT-3.5 refers to
OpenAI’s “gpt-3.5-turbo” model, and Llama-3 refers to the open-sourced “meta-llama-3-70b-instruct”
model that can be found on huggingface.

For the zero-shot transfer RL experiment, we supply all methods with the reference "controller" (i.e.,
the same key press/mouse click leads to the same thing). We do this because language descriptions of
such can be very ambiguous (e.g., a description “a key press leads the bird to flap its wings” can imply
a change in position, velocity, or acceleration). In our experiments, we generate 10 environments and
filter out those that cannot be properly executed with a random policy.

All the RL experiments are implemented in RLLib [20] 8. The PPO agent is trained with a batch
size of 10,000, and an SGD minibatch size of 2048. Our agent used a fully connected network with
hidden layers of sizes (4, 4) and post-FCNet hidden layers of size 16, all employing ReLU activation
functions. The policy network uses an LSTM with a cell size of 64 to incorporate previous actions
but not previous rewards. Over the course of the 10 million training steps, 20 checkpoints were saved,
with the best zero-shot performance on the testing environment reported.

later.
- Please
provide
all

rendered. Color
should
never be white
since
the
background
is white.
- Don ’t provide
Sprite , Surface , or Rect
variables. We will
handle
these
variables
later.
- Don ’t introduce
variables
using
existing
variables (e.g., self.bird_size = self.
pipe_size /2), all
state

should be
independent
of each
other.
- Always
provide a default
value
even if a state
variable
should
be
chosen
randomly. The
randomness
will be
implemented

- " variable_value " should
never to empty
like

Always
provide a non -empty

engineer
can
infer
how the

can be
accessed.
- Do not

files (e.g., .png , .jpg) or sound
effects(e.g., mp3).
- Prioritize
reusing

variables
as much as
possible. For
example , if we
have "position_x" and "position_y " of a character , do not
give me
another
variable
"positions" in a list

- Additionally , you may add new
state
variables
to the

necessary. Please
only
create
new
state
variables
if
necessary.

Additional details and results for the robotics task generation experiment

In this section, we provide the prompts we used for FACTORSIM in the robotics task generation
experiment. The prompts for the baselines can be found in the GenSim paper9 [35].

To conduct human evaluation, we begin by observing the oracle agent attempting to solve the task.
If the oracle agent successfully completes the task, we then assess whether the resulting goal states
align with the input task prompt. If the oracle agent fails to solve the task, we investigate the reason
for the failure. Often, the cause is apparent, such as the target container being too small or not having
the right color of objects for the task. These are marked as failures. For cases where it is clear that the
limitation lies in the oracle agent’s ability, or when the reason for failure is not immediately apparent,
we manually inspect the code for the task specification and base our decision on both the code and
our observation of the oracle agent’s attempt at solving the task.

Listing 7: The state change prompt.

** Objective :**
Create a Python
program
that
generates
state
variables
for a robot
simulation
task. The
state
variables
should be able to depict
the
final
target
environment
for
this
task.

** Task
Details :**
- Task: ‘TARGET_TASK_NAME ‘
- Goal: ‘TARGET_TASK_DESCRIPTION ‘
- URDFs: ‘TASK_ASSET_PROMPT ‘

** Requirements :**
- Return a python
function
called ‘get_state_variables ‘ which
returns a list of ‘
StateVariableData ‘ objects. We should be able to take
the
result of this
function
and
plug
them
into a robotics
environment , and it should
display
what
the
final
target
environment
will
look
like
for the
given
task.
- The ‘StateVariableData ‘ dataclass
is
defined
as
follows:
‘‘‘
@dataclass
class
StateVariableData :
variable_description : str
variable_name : str
variable_urdf : str
variable_size : Tuple[float , float , float]
variable_color : str
variable_target_pose : List[Tuple[Tuple[float , float , float], Tuple[float , float ,

float ]]]
variable_amount : str
static: bool

** Important
Notes **
- Item
sizes
and
positions
must
reflect a realistic
setting. Ensure
logical
spatial
relationships ; items
should
neither
overlap
nor
float
unnaturally . Account
for the
items ’ dimensions
and
sizes
when
determining
their
placement.
- " variable_name " is a unique
name
for
every
state
variable.
- " variable_size " should
be a list of 3 floats , representing
the
size of the
object
along
the
three
dimension [x, y, z].
- " variable_target_pose " should be a list of poses , where
each
pose is a 2-element
list
containining
the 3-element
position
vector , and 4-element
quaternion
rotation. The
position
vectors
should
be within
the
following
boundaries : [0.25 ,
0.75]
for the x-
axis , [-0.5, 0.5]
for the y-axis , and [0.01 ,
0.3]
for the z-axis. For a single
object , the
target
pose
should
only
contain
one
element , like
[[[0.52 , 0.02 , 0.001] ,
[0, 0, 0, 1]]].
For
multiple
objects , the
target
pose
can
contain
multiple
items ,
like
[[[0.52 , 0.02 , 0.001] , [0, 0, 0, 1]], [[0.48 , 0.02 , 0.001] , [0, 0, 0, 1]]].
- "static" describes
if an
object is
something
part of the
environment
and is not
something
the
robotic
agent
should
be
moving. For example , if the
task is to put a
ball
into
the
container , the
container
should be static.

Listing 8: The subtask code generation prompt .

** Objective :** You are
designing a training
plan
for a robotic
arm in a simulation
environment
to
complete a task ‘TARGET_TASK_NAME ‘. This
task
will be
completed
in
multiple
subtasks
from
the
subtask
list. Each
subtask
manages
the
robotic
arm to
move
the
composition
of
assets
from
one
state to another , ultimately
achieving
the
ideal
state
that
completes
the
task.
For
this step , you are
asked to
generate
the
subtask
function
for ‘SUBTASK_NAME ‘. It
involves
‘SUBTASK_DESCRIPTION ‘. Refer to the
existing
template
and use the
existing
variables
to inform
your
subtask
creation. You
will
generate
Python
code
for {
state_variable_for_SUBTASK_NAME } and { subtask_code_for_SUBTASK_NAME }, and
return
the
code
with
the
given
JSON
format.

** Task
Overview :**
- Task
Name: ‘TARGET_TASK_NAME ‘
- Task
Description: ‘TARGET_TASK_DESCRIPTION ‘
- All
Subtask
Descriptions : ‘TARGET_SUBTASK_LIST ‘
- Current
Subtask
Name: ‘SUBTASK_NAME ‘
- Current
Subtask
Description : ‘SUBTASK_DESCRIPTION ‘

** Existing
template **
SUBTASK_CODE_TEMPLATE

** Subtask
Requirements :**
- Generate
Python
code
addressing
the
specified
subtask
based on the
provided
description
and
initial
variables.
- Adhere to
guidelines: use
specified
APIs
you
just
reviewed , avoid
unknown
libraries ,
and
comment
on the
code
for
clarity.
- Ensure
all
state
manager
variables
used in the
subtask
code
are
already
defined.

** Subtask
function
important
Notes :**
- Only
one ‘self.add_goal ‘ should be used , and it
should
not be used on state
variables
marked
with
static=True.
- The ‘matches ‘ argument
in the
method
called ‘self.add_goal ‘ should
always be a numpy
array.
- Do not use
libraries , functions , and
assets
that
you don ’t know.
- Do not
create
additional
functions
inside
the
subtask
function , only
return
one
function.
- Do not add
state
variables
marked as "static = True" to the
environment
using ‘env.
add_object ‘.

22


---Page Break---
- When
passing
in color
using ‘env.add_object ‘, remember
to pass it using
utils.COLORS[
item_color ]. Good
example
is: ‘env.add_object(base_block_urdf , base_block_pose ,
color=utils.COLORS[’red ’]) ‘. Bad
example
is: ‘env. add_object (base_block_urdf ,
base_block_pose , ’red ’)‘
- In the
subtask
code , you
need to create
both
the
initial
pose
and the
target
pose. The
Initial
pose
should
NOT be very
close to or be the
same as the
target
pose. Initial
pose
determines
where
the
object
will be placed
before
the
training
starts. Target
pose
determines
the
ideal
pose
where
the
robot
arm
will
receive
reward if placed
right in the
simulation. You
should
prioritize
using
the
target_pose
from
the
state
manager
variables.
- Only
use
get_random_pose
for
initial
pose(position
and
rotation). ‘get_random_pose (env ,
obj_size)‘ gets
random
collision -free
object
pose
within
workspace
bounds. param
obj_size: (3, ) contains
the
object
size in x,y,z dimensions . return: translation
(3, ), rotation (4, ). You
should
pass
the
obj_size
directly
to the
get_random_pose
function , instead
of its
single
element. Good
example
is: self. get_random_pose (env ,
block_size). Bad
example
is: self. get_random_pose (env , block_size [0]) or env.
get_random_pose (block_size).
- If you are
generating a pose
from ‘get_random_pose ‘. It will be within
bounds. You don ’
t need to check it using
other
helper
function
like ‘is_pose_within_bounds ‘. Do not
use ‘np.copy ‘ to copy it.
- If you
need
initial
rotation , use ‘get_random_pose ‘ to get the ‘pose ‘ first. Then
use ‘
pose [1]‘ as
rotation. Do not
initiate
it in other ways , a bad
example
is ‘rotation =
np.float32(p. getMatrixFromQuaternion (pose [1])).reshape (3, 3) ‘.
- DO NOT USE ‘pose = p. getBasePositionAndOrientation (object_id) ‘. It ’s for
environment
simulation.
- DO NOT USE
other
unlisted
way to create ‘pose ‘.
- In self.add_goal , make
sure to set " step_max_reward =1./ SUBTASK_COUNT "
- Each ‘env.add_object ‘ call
will
create a new
object
id. If only
one
object is needed
in
this
subtask , then
pass in ‘objs = [object_id]‘ in ‘self.add_goal ‘. If
multiple
objects
are needed , create a list
that
contains
all the
needed
object
ids
then
pass
in the
list: ‘objs = object_id_list ‘.
- Make
sure
you
include
all the
arguments
to ‘self.add_goal ‘: ‘objs ‘, ‘matches ‘, ‘
targ_poses ‘, ‘replace ‘, ‘rotations ‘, ‘metric ‘, ‘params ‘, ‘step_max_reward ‘, ‘
language_goal ‘.
- For ‘self.add_goal ‘’s argument
‘matches ‘, it
should be ‘matches=np.ones ((n, n)) ‘. ‘n‘
represents
the
total
amount
of
objects
added to the ‘env ‘. E.g. ‘env.add_object ‘ was
called 4 times
then it should be set as ‘matches=np.ones ((4, 4)) ‘.
- You
have
been
given
all the
task
variables
for
creating
the
subtask. Do not
assume
any
unknown
variables.
- Only
three
functions
are
available
from ‘utils ‘: ‘utils.apply ‘, ‘utils.
quatXYZW_to_eulerXYZ ‘ and ‘utils.COLORS ‘. Do not
make up any
other
functions
from ‘
utils ‘.
- Do not
include
triple
quotes
(""") in your code , only
use
‘#‘ for
comments.
- If the
asset of this
subtask
involves
‘zone ‘, make
sure
that
pose of the
zone
should
not be moved , it ’s usually
used
for
creating
target
position
for
other
items. E.g:
‘zone_size = [0.12 , 0.12 , 0]
zone_urdf = ’zone/zone.urdf ’
zone_colors = [’yellow ’, ’blue ’, ’green ’]
zone_poses = []
for
color in
zone_colors :
zone_pose = self. get_random_pose (env , zone_size)
env.add_object(zone_urdf , zone_pose , ’fixed ’, color=utils.COLORS[color ])
zone_poses.append(zone_pose)‘
- If the
subtask
involves
updating
the
rotation , you may
call ‘utils.quatXYZW_to_eulerXYZ
‘. Here ’s what
this
function
do:
‘def
quatXYZW_to_eulerXYZ ( quaternion_xyzw ):
# pylint: disable=invalid -name
""" Abstraction

Additional details for the proposed generative simulation benchmark

This section provides the prompts for all 8 RL games in the benchmark.

Listing 9: The prompt for the game Catcher.

Create a catcher
character , represented
as a rectangle , positioned
at the
bottom
and the
middle
of the
screen.
Allow
the
player to
control
the
catcher ’s horizontal
movement
using
the
left
and
right
arrow
keys on the
keyboard.
There
should
always
be
exactly
one
ball on the
screen at all
times. The
ball
should be
visually
distinct
and
easily
recognizable .
Make
the
ball
move
downwards
at a steady
pace
towards
the
catcher. The
speed
can be
constant
or
increase
gradually
as the
game
progresses .
Detect
collisions
between
the
catcher
and the
ball. When
the
catcher
catches a ball ,
increment
the player ’s score , spawn a new ball , and
display
this
score in the top -
left
corner of the
screen.
Give
the
player a 3 lives. Each
time a ball is missed
by the
catcher
and
reaches
the
bottom
of the screen , decrease
the player ’s life
count by one.
End the
game
when
the player ’s lives
reach
zero. Display a "Game
Over !"
message
and
temporarily
halt
gameplay
but
dont
terminate
the
game.
Provide
an option
for the
player to click
the
screen to
restart
the
game
after
the "Game
Over" screen is
displayed.
Continuously
generate
new
balls
after
each
catch or miss , ensuring
endless
gameplay.
Optionally , increase
the game ’s difficulty
gradually
by
speeding
up the ball ’s fall
or
reducing
the
size of the
catcher
as the player ’s score
increases.

Listing 10: The prompt for the game Flappy Bird.

Create a bird
character , visually
represented
as a simple
rectangle
within
the
game
window.
Introduce
gravity , causing
the
bird to
continuously
fall
slowly.
Allow
the
bird to ’jump ’ or
accelerate
upwards
in
response
to a player ’s mouse
click ,
temporarily
overcoming
gravity.
Periodically
spawn
pairs of
vertical
pipes
moving
from
right to left
across
the
screen.
Each
pair
should
have a gap for the
bird to pass
through , and
their
heights
should
vary
randomly.
If the
bird
makes
contact
with
the ground , pipes or goes
above
the top of the
screen
the
game is over.
Implement
the
following
scoring
system: for
each
pipe it
passes
through
it gains a
positive
reward
of +1.
Each
time a terminal
state is
reached
it
receives a negative
reward
of
-1.
When
the
game ends , display a "Game
Over !"
messagea
and
stop
all the
motion of the
game.
Show
the
current
score in the top -left
corner of the
screen
during
gameplay.
Ensure
the
game
has no
predefined
end and
that
new
pipes
continue
to generate ,
maintaining
consistent
difficulty
as the
game
progresses .

Listing 11: The prompt for the game Snake.

Create a snake
character
represented
as a series of
connected
pixels or blocks. Initially
, the
snake
should be a single
block (i.e. the
head) that
moves in a specific
direction
within
the
game
window.
Allow
the
player to
control
the snake ’s movement
using
arrow
keys. The
snake
should be
able to turn
left or right , but it
should
not be able to move
directly
backward. Eg.
if its
moving
downwards
it
cannot
move up.
The
movement
of the
snake
should be
continuous
in the
current
direction
until
the
player
provides
new
input. Ensure
that
the
snake
moves
one
grid
unit at a time.
Implement a basic
food
system
where
one
food
item
appears
randomly
on the
screen.
When
the
snake
consumes
the
food by moving
over or
colliding
with it , the snake ’s length
increases , and the
player
earns
points. It
recieves a positive
reward , +1, for
each
food
the
head
comes in
contact
with. While
getting
-1 for
each
terminal
state it
reaches.
If the
head of the
snake
comes in
contact
with
any of the
walls or its own body , the
game
should
end.
Incorporate a scoring
system , displaying
the
current
score on the
screen
during
gameplay.
The
score
should
increase
each
time
the
snake
consumes
food.
Ensure
that
the
game
has no
predefined end , allowing
the
snake to
continue
growing
and
the
difficulty
to
increase
over
time. New
food
items
should
appear
after
the
snake
consumes
one.
Provide
an option
for the
player to
restart
the
game
after it ends. Display a "Restart"
option
on the
game
over
screen to allow
the
player
to play
again.

Listing 12: The prompt for the game Pixelcopter.

Create a copter
character
represented
as a large
white
square
that
remains
fixed
horizontally
but can
ascend
and
descend
vertically
within
the
game
window.

25


---Page Break---
Introduce
gravity
mechanics , causing
the
copter to
continuously
descend
slowly. Enable
the
player to ascend
when
the
player
clicks
the mouse , allowing
it to
momentarily
counteract
gravity
and
rise
upwards.
Create
obstacles
in the
shape of a cavern. Construct
the
cavern
using a series of
vertically
aligned
rectangular
barriers
positioned
at both
the
bottom
and the top of
the
screen. Ensure
the
adjacent
obstacles
are of
similar
length to
maintain a
consistently
smooth "tunnel" effect.
Implement
collision
detection
to detect
when
the
copter
collides
with
obstacles
or the
boundaries
of the
game
window , triggering
the end of the
game
upon
collision.
Display a "Game
Over !"
message
prominently
when
the
game
ends
due to a collision , halting
all
movement
within
the
game
and
prompting
the
player
to
restart.
Create a scoring
system
that
rewards
the
player
based on how far the
copter
travels
through
the
maze
without
colliding
with
obstacles.
Show
the
current
score in the top
left
area of the
screen.
Ensure
the
game
has no
predefined
end and
that
new
obstacles
continue
to generate ,
maintaining
consistent
difficulty
as the
game
progresses
Allow
the
player to start a new
game
after a collision.

Listing 13: The prompt for the game Pong.

Create a paddle
character
for the
human
player , represented
as a rectangle , positioned
on
the
left
side of the
screen.
Allow
the
human
player
to
control
the paddle ’s vertical
movement
using
the up and
down
arrow
keys. The
paddle
has a little
velocity
added to it to allow
smooth
movements.
Implement a paddle
character
for the CPU
opponent , also
represented
as a rectangle ,
positioned
on the
opposite
side of the
screen.
Introduce a ball
that
moves
across
the
screen
with a speed. The
ball
should
bounce
off
the
paddles
and the top and
bottom
walls of the
game
window.
If the
ball
goes
off the
left or right
side of the screen , reset
its
position
to the
center
and its
direction.
The CPU to
control
its paddle ’s vertical
movement
to
autonomously
track
the
ball.
Detect
collisions
between
the
ball
and the
paddles. When
the
ball
collides
with a paddle ,
make it bounce
off in the
opposite
direction.
Implement a scoring
system
that
rewards
the
human
player
for
returning
the
ball
back (i.e
. making
contact
with
the bal).
Display
the
current
score at the top of the
screen. Ensure
the
game
has no
predefined end
, allowing
for
continuous
play.
Display a "Game
Over !"
message
when
one
player
reaches a score of 5 and
provide
an
option
for the
player to
restart
the
game
after
the "Game
Over" screen is
displayed.

Listing 14: The prompt for the game Puckworld.

Create
an agent
character , visually
represented
as a blue
circle , positioned
on the
screen. The
agent
should be
movable
in any
direction
based on user
input.
Implement a green
dot
that
moves
randomly
around
the screen , serving
as the
target
for
the
agent to
navigate
towards.
Introduce a red puck , a larger
entity
that
slowly
follows
the agent ’s movements
on the
screen.
Allow
the
player to
control
the agent ’s movement
using
arrow
keys or
another
specified
input
method.
Implement a scoring
system
that
positively
rewards
the
agent
proportionally
to the
closeness
between
the
agent
and the
green dot , and
penalizes
the
agent
for
proximity
to the red
puck.
Display
the
current
score in the top -left

Additional details for the human study experiment

In this section, we first provide details for the experiment and then the instructions we gave to human
participants in our human study, along with the user interface. We also provide the detailed results of
this evaluation for all games in Figure 9.

Human participants were asked to play and evaluate the generated games given the prompt while
excluding factors such as aesthetics or difficulty. They rated the games on a scale of 1 to 4, where 4
indicates a fully playable game, 3 is a playable game with some bugs or flaws that hinder gameplay
experience, 2 is an unplayable game (i.e., no interactivity) with correctly rendered UI, and 1 is a
game that crashes or fails to launch.

Listing 17: The instructions we give to human participants to our human study.

Welcome
to your
user
study! Your
task is to
evaluate AI -generated
games.
Select
the
game
you
want to
generate
and
click
the
button "Generate" to
generate
games.
You
might
have to wait
for the
game to load
for 5-10
seconds.

Note
that
the
game is
intentionally
slowed down , making it easier
for you to
evaluate
them!
Thus , when
you
click or press a key/button , the "character" might
react
slower
than
you
expected.
Please
click "Random
Generate" to
generate a game.

- If the
game doesn ’t load (black
screen), select
"1 - unplayable ."
- Please do not
consider
the
difficulty
of the
game.
- Please don ’t take
aesthetics
into
account.
- You
want to assess
whether
the UI
elements
are
rendered
accurately
for
gameplay
purposes
while
excluding
considerations
related
to aesthetics , overlapping , or
duplicated
UI
components.

Given
the
prompt as shown , please
judge
the
playability
of the
game.
- 4: Fully
Playable: the
game is
generally
playable
from
start to finish
without
significant
bugs.
- 3:
Playable
but
with
some
flaws: the
game is
somewhat
playable ( interactable ), but
there
are
issues (inaccurate
logic or
glitches) that
impair
the
gameplay.
- 2: Not
playable: no
interactivity
but the UI seems to be
rendered
correctly.
- 1:
Unplayable: the
game
cannot be started , or it
crashes
immediately
upon
launch.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the abstract and the introduction section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the conclusion section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

30


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the experiment section and our supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material and our code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material and our code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

32


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in our paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite all assets used in our experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

34


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve sensitive data of study participants.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
