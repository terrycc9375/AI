Abstract

Dataset Distillation (DD) is designed to generate condensed representations of
extensive image datasets, enhancing training efficiency. Despite recent advances,
there remains considerable potential for improvement, particularly in addressing
the notable redundancy within the color space of distilled images. In this paper,
we propose AutoPalette, a framework that minimizes color redundancy at the
individual image and overall dataset levels, respectively. At the image level, we
employ a palette network, a specialized neural network, to dynamically allocate
colors from a reduced color space to each pixel. The palette network identifies
essential areas in synthetic images for model training and consequently assigns
more unique colors to them. At the dataset level, we develop a color-guided
initialization strategy to minimize redundancy among images. Representative
images with the least replicated color patterns are selected based on the information
gain. A comprehensive performance study involving various datasets and evaluation
scenarios is conducted, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed
color-aware DD compared to existing DD methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/KeViNYuAn0314/AutoPalette.

Introduction

Large-scale training data is essential for achieving high model performance. However, the sheer
volume of the data poses significant challenges, including computational inefficiency, prolonged
training times, and substantial storage overhead. Data Distillation (DD) [40] offers a promising
solution to this problem. By synthesizing a smaller dataset from the original dataset, DD allows
models trained on the distilled dataset to attain comparable performance to those trained on the full
dataset, thereby reducing the resources needed for training.

Existing DD primarily minimizes the difference between the network trained on the full dataset and
the network trained on the synthetic dataset. Different surrogate functions have been implemented to
quantify such differences, including performance matching [40, 29], feature distribution matching
[39, 46] and model gradient matching [47, 3]. Generally speaking, DD considers the synthetic images
as parameters and directly optimizes them. Building on this concept, parameterization-based dataset
distillation (PDD) extends DD by enhancing the storage utility and reducing redundancy in the image
space. Parameterization-based DD methods represent the synthetic dataset in a lower-dimensional
space and then, reconstruct synthetic images for model training. Current parameterization-based
DD includes: learning in a spatially down-sampled space [20], factorizing distilled images [9, 24],
optimizing latent embeddings and generators [45, 4], and selecting informative frequency bands [35].

While the existing PDD methods have shown promising results, most of the methods overlook
the redundancy in the color space, thereby falling short of achieving optimal parameterization
performance. We argue that reducing the number of unique colors within one image can have
minimal impact on the low-level discriminative features (e.g., shapes, edges) required for model

training. Moreover, images within the same class typically share similar color distributions; therefore,
dedicating storage to unique class patterns rather than storing the replicated color information would
be more cost-effective.

To address the limitations of existing PDD approaches, we propose a color-oriented redundancy
reduction framework, namely AutoPalette. Specifically, AutoPalette contains an efficient plug-
and-play palette network to tackle the issue of color space redundancy within one image. This
palette network transforms 8-bit color images into representations with fewer colors (e.g., 4-bit) by
aggregating pixel-level color information from input images. To enhance the color utility, we design
two additional losses on top of the dataset distillation loss: the maximum color loss and the palette
balance loss. The maximum color loss ensures that each color in the reduced color space is allocated
to at least one pixel, while the palette balance loss balances the number of pixels allocated to each
color. The palette network synthesizes image datasets with a reduced color space while preserving
essential features of the original images. Furthermore, we equip AutoPalette with a color-guided
initialization module to suppress the redundancy in-between synthetic images. The module selects
the samples with low replication after color condensation as the synthetic set initialization, whereas
information gain is adopted to quantify replication.

Contributions. We propose AutoPalette, a color-oriented redundancy reduction framework for
data distillation tasks, enhancing storage efficiency by reducing the number of colors in the images
while preserving essential features; We seamlessly equip the distillation framework with a guided
initialization strategy that selects images with diverse structures in the reduced color space for
initialization; Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that the model trained
on the 4-bit images synthesized by our framework achieve competitive results compared to the models
trained on 8-bit images synthesized by other DD methods. With the same storage budget, our method
outperforms others by 1.7%, 4.2% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.

Dataset Distillation

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small but informative dataset, enabling models trained on
these synthetic data to achieve comparable performance to those trained on the complete dataset.
Wang el al. [40] firstly proposed a meta-model learning approach to optimize a synthetic dataset
matching the model performance of large scale dataset. Early works adopt performance matching
frameworks [28, 30, 49, 37], and optimize synthetic data using model performance rolling over the
training process on the original dataset. Distribution matching methods [39, 46, 48, 32] address high
complexity issues in bi-level optimization by matching one step feature distributions between synthetic

data and original real data. Gradient matching [47, 44, 25] and trajectory matching [3, 6, 12, 10]
approaches aim to match model parameters’ gradients for single or multiple training steps, leading
networks trained on synthetic data and original data to follow similar gradient descent trajectories.

2.2
Parameterization-based Dataset Distillation

Apart from finding matching objectives between the synthetic dataset and the original full dataset,
another aspect of data distillation involves appropriately parameterizing synthetic data in different yet
more efficient representatives in memory space. Without storing synthetic data as individual spatial
representations, parameterization comprehends mutual characteristics between data instances and
regenerates more data instances of the original input representations. IDC [20] stores images in a
low-resolution manner to conserve storage resources, and upsamples to the original scale for usage.
Factorization methods conjecture inter-class data share mutual and independent information and
generate synthetic data based on combinations of bases. Bases can be either spatial representations
[9], frequency domains [41], or embeddings decoded by networks [23, 24, 41, 45, 5, 38].

2.3
Color Quantization

Color quantization [31, 8, 1, 43] intends to aggregate similar colors and transform them using one
representative color. Accordingly, images with a reduced color palette require less storage as the
pixel values can be encoded in fewer bits. To uphold optimal image authenticity, traditional color
quantization methods such as Median Cut [15], dithering [13], and OCTree [11] typically employ
color quantization as a color clustering problem. They commonly devise strategies to identify similar
or neighboring colors for quantization purposes. On the other hand, parameter-based methods
[36, 27, 16, 17] not only rely on predefined heuristics but also leverage neural networks to learn
patterns and relationships to compress images to lower bits.

Methodology

3.1
Notations and Preliminary

Dataset distillation aims to learn a small but representative synthetic dataset S = {(˜xi, ˜yi)}
|S|
i=0 from

a given large scale dataset T = {(xi, yi)}
|T |
i=0. Here, |S| and |T | denote the number of samples in the
synthetic dataset and original large dataset, where |S| ≪|T |. By training on the synthetic dataset S,
a model ϕ(·; θ) is aimed to achieve performance comparable to that of a model trained on the original
dataset T . The objective of dataset distillation can be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem:

min
S Eθ[L(T , θS)], where θS = arg min
θ
L(S, θ),
(1)

where L(·, ·) and θ represent loss function and parameters of the networks, respectively. The inner-
loop optimizes the network on the synthetic dataset and the outer loop evaluates the trained network
on the real dataset.

3


---Page Break---
The bi-level meta learning in Eq. 1 requires inner-loop training during every training steps, and thus
suffers from inevitable computational cost. Therefore, some of the existing methods [47, 3, 46] try
to avoid unrolled back-propagation in the inner loop using various surrogate objectives, thereby the
optimal synthetic dataset S∗can be obtained by optimizing:

S∗= arg min
S
Eθ[L(ϕ(T ; θ), ϕ(S; θ))].
(2)

In parameterization methods for dataset distillation, the synthetic dataset S is stored in more efficient
representations consisting of bases B ∈RN×C×H×W and a set of transformation functions F : B →
S, which generate the synthetic dataset. Here, N denotes the number of bases, C represents the
channel, and H and W are the height and width of the bases, respectively. In this paper, we propose
a color transformation that reduces the number of unique colors in the image bases while preserving
the essential details after color reduction for model training.

3.2
Overview

In this paper, we explore a new dimension of parameterization-based dataset distillation, concentrating
on optimizing storage efficiency by minimizing color space redundancy. We argue that complex
color representation within storage-sensitive distilled images is not crucial for training networks.
Instead, the limited storage budget for distilled images should be allocated to novel samples that
exhibit diverse object structures. The overall framework of AutoPalette is illustrated in Figure 1.

The proposed AutoPalette framework for dataset distillation consists of two components, including
a palette network and a color-guided initialization strategy. The palette network is designed to
enhance the color utility of the synthetic images in reduced color space by generating pixel-level
color mappings. Accordingly, the original images ˜x ∈RC×H×W ∈S are transformed into color-
condensed images b ∈RC×H×W ∈B with a reduced color spectrum, where we denote the process
as ϕpalette : S →B. RGB image dataset generally contains 256 distinct colors for each channel, and
the palette network aims to reduce the number of colors by generating a color palette containing only
K colors. As such, the synthetic dataset can be stored in a low-bit format, rather than the conventional
8-bit format. To better leverage the diverse color feature information within the original dataset, we
equip the proposed framework with a novel initialization strategy, which employs the generalized
graph cut function to select representative images for initialization. Our method dynamically evaluates
the impact of real images based on their color structures and initializes the synthetic dataset with the
images that yield the highest information gains of graph cut functions. The subsequent sections will
illustrate each module in detail.

3.3
Color Reduction via Palette Network.

The core of our proposed parameterization method for dataset distillation is to condense the number
of unique colors in an image so that the image can be stored with a more efficient manner. One of the
key challenges of reducing the unique color number in dataset distillation lies in local discriminative
feature preservation. When an image is represented with a smaller range of color, it is inevitable for
some pixels to be merged to their neighbour color blocks. In this case, some of the local discriminative
features (e.g., edge, shape, etc.) can be erased or distorted in the color-reduced images, hindering the
network trained on them to achieve the optimal performance.

To alleviate this issue, we design a simple yet effective network, namely palette network, which learns
the pixel-level color allocation in the pruned color space with the discriminative feature maximally
preserved. Particularly, the color palette network predicts the probability map m ∈RC×H×W ×K,
which indicates the probability of a pixel being allocated to a color of the K-dimensional reduced
color space by forwarding an image ˜x to the palette network:

m = ϕcolor(˜x; θc),
(3)

where θc is the parameters of the palette network.

Given a base image b and its corresponding probability map m, we formulate the palette ˜m ∈RC×K
as the average pixel values of all pixels assigned to the same color buckets index:

˜mc,k =

P

c,i,j ˜xc,i,j · δm
c,i,j(k)
P

c,i,j δm
c,i,j(k)
,
(4)

4


---Page Break---
where c and k denote the c-th channel for the k-th quantized color, i and j denote the vertical and
horizontal pixel position in an image, and δm is the Kronecker delta function, which equals 1 if
arg max mc,i,j equals k.

Once the color palette ˜m and a probability map m are generated for an image, its color condensed
image b, with the number of unique colors per channel reduced to K, can be generated by an index
searching process:
bc,i,j = ˜m[c, h], where h = arg max
k
mc,i,j.
(5)

To learn the palette network, a straightforward solution is to optimize the distillation task loss during
the training stage. However, we can observe from Fig. 2 that solely relying on the task loss for
training the palette network leads to most of the palette being inactivated. The network tends to assign
pixels to a limited number of color buckets, which strongly limits the capacity and expressiveness
of the distilled images. Therefore, two additional losses, namely maximum color loss and palette
balance loss, are incorporated to enhance the utility of color buckets in synthetic images. In particular,
maximum color loss, Lm encourages the palette network to generate color allocation such that each
color bucket is at least filled with one pixel within color palette. By aggregating the maximum
confidences from probability index maps across the spatial dimensions, we define the maximum color
loss as:

Lm = −1

CK

C
X

c=1

K
X

k=1
max
(h,w)(mc,h,w,k),
(6)

While the maximum color loss ensures the activation of each color bucket in the palette, the distribu-
tion of pixel numbers in color buckets can still be extremely imbalanced. Therefore, our framework
leverages a palette balance loss Lb, which encourages a more balanced usage of the buckets within the
color palette by promoting color-wise entropy. We formulate the palette balance loss as the entropy
of m over the spatial dimensions:

Lb =
1

c=1

(7)

where P(·) represents the softmax function of m over the spatial dimensions.

By integrating the palette network with the complementary losses, we obtain the color condensed
images while preserving the informative features.

3.4
Color Guided Initialization Module

The empirical results of previous studies have shown a strong correlation [3, 46] between the original
images selected during initialization and the resulting distilled images in terms of visual appearance.
In light of this finding, we propose an initialization method aimed at solving the redundancy problem
in color-condensed synthetic images. However, since we do not have access to the optimized
palette network, it is prohibitive to directly measure the information overlap within a class after
color condensation. To mitigate this issue, we propose to leverage the traditional color quantization
approach [15] to approximate the output of the palette network. Here, we denote the quantized full
dataset as T Q. Our proposed initialization strategy leverages conditional gain within submodular
information theoretics to identify the most diverse images of each class after color condensation.
Specifically, the conditional gain G(A|C) implies the gain of information by adding set C to set A,
where A, C ⊂T Q and A ∩C = ∅. Formally, we have:

G(A|C) = G(T Q) −G(C),
(8)

where G(·) denotes a submodular function. Submodular information functions [18] describe a set of
combinatorial functions that satisfy the Shannon inequality [34, 26] and can effectively model the
diversity of a subset. In our implementation, we adopt a monotone submodular function, namely
generalized graph cut [2], which maximizes the similarities between samples in A and C and
minimizes and dissimilarities among the samples in A. The generalized graph cut function G∗(·) is
defined as follows:

G∗(A|C) =
X

i∈C

X

j∈A
Sim(i, j) −
X

j1,j2∈A
Sim(j1, j2),
(9)

5


---Page Break---
where i and j denote data samples from the sets C and A, respectively. Sim(·, ·) is a similarity
function between two samples. Instead of directly measuring the feature level similarity, we propose
to measure the similarity between the last layer gradients ∇θ as follows:

Sim(i, j) = cos(∇θLCE(Q(˜xi), θ), ∇θLCE(Q(˜xj), θ)),
(10)

where cos(·, ·) is the cosine similarity function, Q denotes the Median Cut quantization method, ˜xi
and ˜xj are the ith and jth samples of set T , and ∇θ is the gradient of cross-entropy loss between the
prediction and the ground truth label on the last layer of the network. By substituting Eq.(9) into Eq.
(8), we select a representative sample for inclusion in A by:

arg max
c
G∗(A) −2
X

i∈A

X

c∈C
Sim(i, c).
(11)

The proof for the graph cut conditional gain is provided in Appendix A.1. From Eq. (11), we can see
that the data sample obtaining the highest conditional gain may be selected. Intuitively, we select the
most representative sample from the unselected set C, whilst ensuring it is dissimilar to the already
selected samples in A. The entire color diversity selection process is provided in Algorithm 1.

By far, our initialization method can select diverse and representative samples of each class in the
approximated quantization set. To minimize the difference between the approximation set and the
output of the palette network, we put forward a regularization term La. The regularization term
not only constrains the color allocation shifting of palette network, but also enhances allocation
consistency, so similar colors are grouped together with higher fidelity. The regularization term La is
defined as:

La = 1

N ∥h ⊙h⊺−h′ ⊙h′⊺∥
2
2,
(12)

where h′ denotes the the arg max of the color mapping indices by Median Cut over the color space,
and ⊙denotes the element-wise multiplication resulting in a self correlation matrix for palette
bucket allocations of the palette network and Median Cut. When creating index mappings for pixels,
different methods might cluster the same pixels into the same group, but the indices may not match.
By utilizing La, we emphasize clustering resemblance, disregarding the order of clustering indices.

3.5
Overall Dataset Distillation Objective

Our framework aims to create a color-condensed synthetic version of the original dataset while
maximally preserving task-related information. In line with other parameterization-based methods,
we incorporate the dataset distillation loss Ltask from existing works into our framework.

As such, to update the palette network, we have the overall loss function defined as:

arg min
θc
Lpalette = Ltask + αLm + βLb + γLa,
(13)

where α, β, γ are the coefficients as the weights of loss components. The synthetic set S is optimized
as follows:

arg min
S
Ltask = L(ϕ(T ; θ), ϕ(B; θ)), where B = ϕpalette(S; θc),
(14)

where ϕpalette(·; θc) denotes the color quantization process using the palette network.

3.6
Storage Analysis

In our experiments, the images follow the 256-color storage convention, where pixel values occupy
8-bit storage space. Given the storage budget of images per class (IPC), the maximum storage
budget for one class is capped at 8 × IPC × CHW, where C, H and W represent the channel, height
and width of the images, respectively. When representing a colorful image pixel value with n bits,
where 1 ≤n < 8, there can be at most 2n distinct colors per image. This must satisfy the condition
P28−n

i=1 Ni ≤28, where Ni is the number of colors for the i-th color reduced image and each Ni ≤2n.
Therefore, for images with n-bit format, up to 28−n colors can be represented in the storage budget
using a bitmap index with small bytes. The bitmap index indicates the image number associated with
the current lower bit color value.

Experiments

In this section, we first evaluate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with other parameteri-
zation methods on various datasets. Afterwards, we perform experiments on the relations between
synthetic image color number and model performance. We also conduct ablation studies and assess
the efficacy of each proposed component to distillation performance.

4.1
Experimental Setting

We conduct experiments of our model on various benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 [21],
CIFAR-100 [21] and ImageNet [7]. We compare our parameterization method with core-set methods
and other existing DD works containing baselines such as DD [40], DM [46], DC [47], TM [3],
and parameterization techniques including IDC [20], HaBa [24], RTP [9], SPEED [41], FReD [35].
Experiments are performed on different distillation memory budget settings for 1/10/50 images per
class (IPC). We follow the previous works to use a ConvNetD3 for the CIFAR family and ConvNetD5
for ImageNet as the training and evaluation network. We follow the DATM [12] implementation
based on trajectory matching, without soft label initialization using correctly predicted samples. Each
experiment is evaluated on 5 randomly initialized networks, and the mean and standard deviation of
the evaluation accuracy are recorded. We set loss coefficients α=1, β=1, γ=3 for all experiments if
not specified. All experiments can be conducted on 2×Nvidia H100 GPUs that have 80GB RAM for
each or 4×Nvidia V100 GPUs that have 32GB RAM for each.

4.2
Experimental Results

Results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We perform experiments under paramterization settings on
CIFAR10 [21], CIFAR100 [21]. We set color palette network to condense the number of colors of
a single image from 256 to 64, such that despite huge color space reduction quantized images still
preserve much fidelity of images. As shown in Table 1, our method achieves superior performance
than other parameterization works in various tasks. Notably, in the experiments when IPC equals
10 and 50, our method significantly outperforms other methods. In CIFAR100 experiments, our
model achieves 52.6% and 53.3% classification accuracy when IPC is respectively 10 and 50, which
increases 6.7% and 4.2% higher than previous state-of-the-art parameterization methods. These
outstanding performances highlight that reducing the color redundancy within the synthetic dataset
can improve the storage utility and thereby improve the distillation result.

Results on ImageNet. Following [3], we conduct experiments on six subsets of ImageNet, where
each subset consists of 10 classes and the images are of resolution 128×128. We conduct experiments
with the storage budget of IPC=10. ConvNetD5 is employed as the backbone model for training

and evaluation. From Table 2, we can see our method outperforms other PDD methods on most
of ImageNet subsets, including ImageNette, ImageWoof, ImageMeow and ImageYellow, while
results of the other subsets still achieve comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art results.
Specifically, our method achieves 44.3% and 72.0% on hard datasets ImageWoof and ImageYellow,
increasing 0.2% and 1.5% than previous best PDD methods. We also observe that for subsets
with distinct classes, our method achieves promising results, which is because color condensation
effectively preserves the key semantics necessary for accurate classification. On the other hand, for
fine-grained subsets where the classes are similar, we observe inferior performance. This is likely
because fine-grained details are blurred in images represented by fewer colors, thereby making it
challenging to differentiate between classes.

Compatibility of Distillation Frameworks. While we take trajectory matching as our primary
distillation method, we demonstrate that our framework can effortlessly be equipped to improve other
dataset distillation methods. As illustrated in Table 5, our method shows a significant performance
boost across all IPC settings and datasets when adopted to the distribution matching method. Espe-
cially, our method increases the test accuracy up to 15% when IPC=10, and 15.7% for IPC=1 on
CIFAR100. This observation aligns with our objectives that our color-oriented redundancy man-
agement framework should be adapted across different standard DD frameworks The performance
improvement underscores the high compatibility of our methods with diverse DD frameworks.

4.3
Ablation Study

Here, we focus on comparing variants of our proposed framework. Therefore, we fix the number of
synthetic images to 10 per class, rather than fully utilizing the available storage capacity.

Effectiveness of Loss Components. To validate the contribution of each loss term to the overall
framework, we conduct experiments on CIFAR10 with IPC=10. Specifically, we construct three
variants of our model by removing Lm, Lb, and La, correspondingly. We show the experimental
result in Table 3. Under the same experimental conditions, eliminating specific loss functions will

function in optimizing the palette network.

Effectiveness of Selection Criteria in the Color-guided Initialization. We compare our proposed
initialization with two baseline sample selection criteria, including Random Real, and Graph Cut Real.
Random real is widely adopted by DD methods, which randomly select images from the full dataset
as the initialization of the synthetic dataset. In Graph Cut Real, we apply graph cut on 8-bit images

Real, the selection criteria used in our framework computes the information gain over the quantized
images. From table 4, we can see that our methods using quantized images exhibit better performance
than comparison approaches. The graph cut with original full-color images also outperforms the
baseline model using randomly selected real images as initialization, confirming the effectiveness of

computing information gain over color-reduced images

Effectiveness of Color-guided Initialization under Dif-
ferent Color Depth. Our experiments compare the perfor-
mance of two ways to initialize the base images: one em-
ploying our method of color-guided initialization (denotes
GraphCut), and randomly selecting real images as the base
images (denotes Baseline). We contrast two approaches
on CIFAR10 with IPC=10, spanning from synthesizing
images with low-bit quantization to those with higher-bit
quantization. From Figure 3, we observe that our method
brings better performance when quantized images are rep-
resented in lower bits. Starting from 16 colors per pixel,
we observe a gradual convergence in performance as we
move towards utilizing full-color space. Meanwhile, as
can be seen, when K=32 and 64, it achieves the best trade-
off, as it still attains competitive performance comparable
to that of full-color budget images, while substantially
reducing the storage space required for quantized images.

Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work

In this paper, we aim to solve the color-redundancy issue within data distillation from both the image
level and the dataset level. For condensing the colors within images, we utilize a palette network to
capture the color redundancy between pixels and represent images using fewer colors. Beyond this,
to reduce repetitive patterns in between synthetic images design a guided image initialization module
that selects samples by maximising information gain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that our AutoPalette framework can effectively reduce color redundancy and simultaneously preserve
the essential low-level feature for model training.

Limitations. For instance, images from different classes may have a bias towards color usage. Images
of one class may be sufficient to be represented by fewer colors than those from other classes, in
which case an imbalanced color budget arrangement may be a better option. In future, it is also
promising to explore the dynamic color depth allocation, which allocates more budgets to difficult
classes, thereby improving the distillation performance.

Proof for Conditional Information Gain of Graph Cut

The generalized graph cut set function is defined as:

f(A) = λ

i∈T

X

a∈A
Sim(i, a) −
X

a1,a2∈A
Sim(a1, a2),
(15)

where A ⊂T , and Sim is a similarity function. The submodular conditional gain is defined as:

f(A|B) ≜f(A ∪B) −f(B),
(16)

which indicates the gain by adding samples in set B to A. By substituting Eq. (16) with (15), we can
obtain:

f(A|B) =λ

i∈T

c∈A∪B
Sim(i, c) −

b1,b2∈B
Sim(b1, b2).
(17)

In the sample selection cases, A and B are disjoint, and thus P

c∈A∪B can be rewritten as P

c∈A−B.
Therefore, we can reformulate f(A ∪B):

f(A ∪B) =λ

(18)

We can then formulate Eq. (16) as:

f(A|B) = f(A \ B) −2
X

a′∈A\B

X

b∈B
Sim(a′, b).
(19)

When A and B are disjoint, A is independent of B and we then simplify the conditional gain of graph
cut function to:
f(A|B) = f(A) −2

a′∈A\B

b∈B

Experimental Details

Datasets. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets:

• CIFAR10: an image dataset consists of 50,000 32×32 RGB images for training, and 10,000
images for testing. CIFAR10 contains 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog,
frog, horse, ship, truck.
• CIFAR100: an image dataset that is similar to CIFAR100, but has 100 classes containing
600 images each.
• ImageNet subsets: high resolution image subsets of ImageNet [7] that contain all 128×128
RGB images and each contains 10 classes. ImageNet subsets include include ImageNette,
ImageWoof, ImageFruit, ImageMeow, ImageSquawk, and ImageYellow.

Networks. For the experiments of low resolution datasets including CIFAR10 and CIFAR100,
3-layer convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) are employed and we follow the identical network
structures to the previous works. Each convolution layer contains 128 3×3 filters, followed by an
instance normalization layer, a ReLU, and an average pooling layer with 2×2 kernel and stride 2.

For the high resolution datasets such as ImageNet subsets, we use 5-layer ConvNets to perform the
experiments. For the cross architecture experiments, we employ VGG11 [19], AlexNet [22], and
RestNet18 [14] and follow the implementations of the previous DD works. The palette network
consists of two convolution layers and one ReLU between them. Both two convolution layers have
1×1 kernels and the second layer has no bias.

Implementation details. While we primarily use Trajectory matching (TM) as the distillation
objectives, our method can be seamlessly adapted into other DD frameworks for various downstream
tasks and datasets. In Table 9 and 10, we provide the hyper-parameters settings in our work for both
TM and DM on different datasets. Specifically, although our method is insensitive for most of the
hyper-parameters, certain parameters including synthetic steps, the maximum starting epoch and the
synthetic batch size should be carefully examined.

Cross Architecture Performance

One of the main concerns in data distillation arises from synthetic dataset overfitting to the training
models, resulting in limited generalizability to be used by the other network architectures. Therefore,
cross-architecture performance is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of data distillation methods.
To assess the generalized performance of our method, we employ CIFAR10 synthetic datasets trained
on ConvNet to train various network structures including VGG11 [19], AlexNet [22] and ReNnet18
[14]. The results of cross-network architecture are presented in Table 6. We noticed that when IPC is
relatively higher, our method outperforms the other baseline methods.

ments are performed on CIFAR10, and VGG11, AlexNet and ResNet18 are used for evaluating the
cross architecture performance.

Number of colors vs Performance

Our method still demonstrates competitive performance, even when synthetic images are quantized
into extremely low bits, as shown in Table 7. The test results for CIFAR10 IPC=10 is provided, from
which we can observe a slight performance gap when the number of colors used for quantized images
decreases to merely 8 colors per pixel (3 bits) from the original 256 colors per pixel (8 bits). The
results demonstrate that our color quantization method captures key features for synthetic data and
appropriately condenses images into fewer colors.

Traditional color Quantization Methods

Our palette network aims to identify the essential color characteristics of the synthetic dataset and
represent it with fewer colors. To test the efficacy of the palette network, we compare it with other
color quantization methods on DD tasks, including Median Cut [15] and OCTree [11]. We conduct
the experiments on CIFAR10, and Table 8 shows that the palette network achieves the superior
performances under different IPC settings.

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main contributions of the work are clearly stated in the abstract and
introductions, which is about exploring data distillation from color perspectives.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations are discussed in the last section of the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: All assumptions and proof are clarified in the paper. For example, the proof of
the conditional submodular gain function.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The experiment environments and hyper-parameters are included in the experi-
ment section and appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

20


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All the datasets are open sourced, and the code is provided through the link in
abstract.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All experiment details are specified, and the choices of hyper-paramters are
discussed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Error bars are clearly reported. All experiments are conducted for multiple
times and the mean accuracy and standard deviation are given.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

21


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Computation resources are included in the experiment sections.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The work follows NeurIPS code of ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work has no societal impacts, since it is not related to any social activities.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

22


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper has no such risks, since the data and models are all
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the existing works are properly referenced.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

23


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: New framework is well presented.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: No crowdsourcing is involved in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: No human participant is involved in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
