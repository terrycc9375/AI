Abstract

While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their pho-
torealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering
similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily
excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data – characterized by oc-
clusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination – remains challenging. NeRFs
can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but
3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To
address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions
and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and
integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time
rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in
handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.

Reconstruction of photorealistic 3D representations from a set of images has significant applications
across various domains, including the generation of immersive VR experiences, 3D content creation

for online platforms, games, and movies, and 3D environment simulation for robotics. The primary
objective is to achieve a multi-view consistent 3D scene representation from a set of input images
with known camera poses, enabling photorealistic rendering from novel viewpoints.

Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [1, 25, 37, 30, 38, 26, 9, 17, 29] have addressed this
challenge by learning a radiance field, which combines a density field and a viewing-direction-
dependent color field. These fields are rendered using volumetric rendering [12]. Despite producing
highly realistic renderings, NeRFs require evaluating numerous samples from the field per pixel to
accurately approximate the volumetric integral. Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14, 50, 49, 51, 15, 54]
has emerged as a faster alternative. 3DGS explicitly represents the scene as a set of 3D Gaussians,
which enables real-time rendering via rasterization at a rendering quality comparable to NeRFs.

Learning scene representations from training views alone introduces an ambiguity between geometry
and view-dependent effects. Both NeRFs and 3DGS are designed to learn consistent geometry while
simulating non-Lambertian effects, resolving ambiguity through implicit biases in the representation.
This works well in controlled settings with consistent illumination and minimal occlusion but typically
fails under varying conditions and larger levels of occlusion. However, in practical applications,
images are captured without control over the environment. Examples include crowd-sourced 3D re-
constructions [34, 1], where images are collected at different times, seasons, and exposure levels, and
reconstructions that keep 3D models up-to-date via regular image recapturing. Besides environmental
condition changes, e.g., day-night changes, such images normally contain occluders, e.g., pedestrians
and cars, with which we need to deal with during the reconstruction process.

NeRF-based approaches handle appearance changes by conditioning the MLP that presents the
radiance field on an appearance embedding capturing specific image appearances [24, 38, 24].
This enables them to learn a class of multi-view consistent 3D representations, conditioned on the
embedding. However, this approach does not extend well to explicit representations such as 3DGS
[14], which store the colors of geometric primitives explicitly. Adding an MLP conditioned on an
appearance embedding would slow down rendering, as each frame would require evaluating the MLP
for all Gaussians. For occlusion handling, NeRFs [24, 31] use uncertainty modeling to discount
losses from challenging pixels. However, in cases with both appearance changes and occlusions,
these losses are not robust, often incorrectly focusing on regions with difficult-to-capture appearances
instead of focusing on the occluders. While NeRFs can recover from early mistakes due to parameter
sharing, 3DGS, with its faster training and engineered primitive growth and pruning process, cannot,
as an incorrect training signal can lead to irreversibly removing parts of the geometry.

To address the issues, we propose to enhance Gaussians with trainable appearance embeddings and
using a small MLP to integrate image and appearance embeddings to predict an affine transformation
of the base color. This MLP is required only during training or when capturing the appearance of a
new image. After this phase, the appearance can be "baked" back into the standard 3DGS formulation,
ensuring fast rendering while maintaining the editability and flexibility of the 3DGS representation
[14]. For robust occlusion handling, we introduce an uncertainty predictor with a loss based on DINO
features [27], effectively eliminating occluders during training despite appearance changes.

Our contributions can be summarized as: (1) Appearance Modeling: Extending 3DGS [14] with a
per-Gaussian trainable embedding vector coupled with a tone-mapping MLP, enabling the rendered
image to be conditioned on a specific input image’s embedding. This extension preserves rendering
speed and maintains compatibility with 3DGS [14]. (2) Uncertainty Optimization: Introducing an
uncertainty optimization scheme robust to appearance changes, which does not disrupt the gradient
statistics used in adaptive density control. This scheme leverages the cosine similarity of DINO
v2 [27] features between training and predicted images to create an uncertainty mask, effectively
removing the influence of occluders during training. The source code, model checkpoints, and video
comparisons are available at: https://wild-gaussians.github.io/

Novel View Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes. Recent methods in novel view synthesis [25, 1, 14, 50]
predominantly focus on reconstructing static environments. However, dynamic components usually
occur in real-world scenarios, posing challenges for these methods. One line of work tries to
model both static and dynamic components from a video sequence [19, 28, 43, 44, 10, 21, 7, 46].
Nonetheless, these methods often perform suboptimally when applied to photo collections [32].
In contrast, our research aligns with efforts to synthesize static components from dynamic scenes.

an affine transformation applied to the Gaussian’s view-dependent color. Right: uncertainty modeling (Sec. 3.3).
An uncertainty estimate is obtained by a learned transformation of the GT image’s DINO features. To train the
uncertainty, we use the DINO cosine similarity (dashed lines).

Methods such as RobustNeRF[32] utilize Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for outlier verification
in small, controlled settings, while NeRF On-the-go [31] employs DINO v2 features [27] to predict
uncertainties, allowing it to handle complex scenes with varying occlusion levels, albeit with long
training times. Unlike these approaches, our method optimizes significantly faster. Moreover, we
effectively handle dynamic scenarios even with changes in illumination.

Novel View Synthesis for Unstructured Photo Collections. In real-world scenes, e.g. the unstruc-
tured internet photo collections [35], difficulties arise not only from dynamic occlusions like moving
pedestrians and vehicles but also from varying illumination. Previously, these issues were tackled
using multi-plane image (MPI) methods [20]. More recently, NeRF-W [24], a pioneering work in
this area, addresses these challenges with per-image transient and appearance embeddings, along
with leveraging aleatoric uncertainty for transient object removal. However, the method suffers from
slow training and rendering speeds. Other NeRF-based methods followed NeRF-W extending it
in various ways [37, 47]. Recent concurrent works, including our own, explore the replacement of
NeRF representations with 3DGS for this task. Some methods [33, 6] address the simpler problem
of training 3DGS under heavy occlusions, or only tackling appearance changes [23, 48, 8] with no
occlusions. However, the main challenge is integrating appearance conditioning with the locally inde-
pendent 3D Gaussians under occlusions. VastGaussian [22] applies a convolutional network to 3DGS
outputs which does not transfer to large appearance changes, as shown in the Appendix. SWAG [5]
and Scaffold-GS [23] address this by storing appearance data in an external hash-grid-based implicit
field [26], while GS-W [52] and WE-GS [41] utilize CNN features for appearance conditioning on a
reference image. In contrast, our method employs a simpler and more scalable strategy by embedding
appearance vectors directly within each Gaussian. This design not only simplifies the architecture
but also enables us to ’bake’ the trained representation back into 3DGS after appearances are fixed,
enhancing both efficiency and adaptability. Finally, a concurrent work, Splatfacto-W [45], uses a
similar appearance MLP to combine Gaussian and image embeddings to output spherical harmonics.

Method

Our approach, termed WildGaussians, is shown in Fig. 2. To allow 3DGS-based approaches to handle
the uncontrolled capture of scenes, we propose two key components: (1) appearance modeling
enables our approach to handle the fact that the observed pixel colors not only depend on the
viewpoint but also on conditions such as the capture time and the weather. Following NeRF-based
approaches for reconstructing scenes from images captured under different conditions [24, 30], we
train an appearance embedding per training image to model such conditions. In addition, we train
an appearance embedding per Gaussian to model local effects, e.g., active illumination of parts of
the scene from lamps. Both embeddings are used to transform the color stored for a Gaussian to
match the color expected for a given scene appearance. To this end, we predict an affine mapping

[30] in color space via an MLP. (2) uncertainty modeling allows our approach to handle occluders
during the training stage by determining which regions of a training image should be ignored. To this
end, we extract DINO v2 features [27] from training images, and pass them as input to a trainable
affine transformation which predicts a per-pixel uncertainty, encoding which parts of an image likely
correspond to static regions and which parts show occluders. The uncertainty predictor is optimized
using the cosine similarity between the DINO features extracted from training images and renderings.

Preliminaries: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)

We base our method on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [14, 50] scene representation, where the
scene is represented as a set of 3D Gaussians {Gi}. Each Gaussian Gi is represented by its mean
µi, a positive semi-definite covariance matrix Σi [54], an opacity αi, and a view-dependent color
parametrized using spherical harmonics (SH). During rendering, the 3D Gaussians are first projected
into the 2D image [54], resulting in 2D Gaussians. Let W be the viewing transformation, then the 2D
covariance matrix Σ′
i in image space is given as [54]:

Σ′
i =
 
JWΣiW T JT 

1:2,1:2 ,
(1)

where J is the Jacobian of an affine approximation of the projection. (·)1:2,1:2 denotes the first two
rows and columns of a matrix. The 2D Gaussian’s mean µ′
i is obtained by projecting µi into the
image using W. After projecting the Gaussians, the next step is to compute a color value for each
pixel. For each pixel, the list of Gaussians is traversed from front to back (ordered based on the
distances of the Gaussians to the image plane), alpha-compositing their view-dependent colors ˆci(r)
(where r is the ray direction corresponding to the pixel), resulting in pixel color ˆC:

ˆC =
X

i
αiˆci(r) ,
with
αi = e
1
2 (x−µ′
i)T (Σ′
i)−1(x−µ′
i) ,
(2)

where αi are the blending weights. The representation is learned from a set of images with known
projection matrices using a combination of DSSIM [42] and L1 losses computed between the
predicted colors ˆC and ground truth colors C (as defined by the pixels in the training images):

L3DGS = λdssimDSSIM( ˆC, C) + (1 −λdssim)∥ˆC −C∥1 .
(3)

3DGS [14] further defines a process in which unused Gaussians with a low αi or a large 3D size are
pruned and new Gaussians are added by cloning or splitting Gaussians with large gradient wrt. 2D
means µ′
i. In our work, we further incorporate two recent improvements. First, the 2D µ′
i gradients
are accumulated by accumulating absolute values of the gradients instead of actual gradients [49, 51].
Second, we use Mip-Splatting [50] to reduce aliasing artifacts.

3.2
Appearance Modeling

Following the literature on NeRFs [24, 30, 1], we use trainable per-image embeddings {ej}N
j=1, where
N is the number of training images, to handle images with varying appearances and illuminations,
such as those shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, to enable varying colors of Gaussians under different
appearances, we include a trainable embedding gi for each Gaussian i. We input the per-image
embedding ej, per-Gaussian embedding gi, and the base color ¯ci (0-th order SH) into an MLP f:

(β, γ) = f(ej, gi, ¯ci) .
(4)

The output are the parameters of an affine transformation, where (β, γ) = {(βk, γk)}3
k=1 for each
color channel k. Let ˆci(r) be the i-th Gaussian’s view-dependent color conditioned on the ray
direction r. The toned color of the Gaussian ˜ci is given as:

˜ci = γ · ˆci(r) + β .
(5)

These per-Gaussian colors then serve as input to the 3DGS rasterization process. Our approach is
inspired by [30], which predicts the affine parameters from the image embedding alone in order
to compensate for exposure changes in images. In contrast, we use an affine transformation to
model much more complex changes in appearance. In this setting, we found it necessary to also use
per-Gaussian appearance embeddings to model local changes such as parts of the scene being actively
illuminated by light sources at night.

Figure 3: Uncertainty Losses Under Appearance Changes. We compare MSE and DSSIM uncertainty losses
(used by NeRF-W [24] and NeRF On-the-go [31]) to our DINO cosine similarity loss. Under heavy appearance
changes (as in Image 1 and 2), both MSE and DSSIM fail to focus on the occluder (humans) and falsely
downweight the background, while partly ignoring the occluders.

Note that if rendering speed is important at test time and the scene only needs to be rendered
under a single static condition, it is possible to pre-compute the affine parameters per Gaussian
and use them to update the Gaussian’s SH parameters. This essentially results in a standard 3DGS
representation [14, 50] that can be rendered efficiently.

Initialization of Per-Gaussian Embeddings gi. Initializing the embedding gi randomly could lead
to a lack of locality bias, and thus poorer generalization and training performance, as shown in the
supp. mat. Instead, we initialize them using Fourier features [25, 40] to enforce a locality prior:
We first center and normalize the input point cloud to the range of [0, 1] using the 0.97 quantile of
the L∞norm. The Fourier features of a normalized point p are then obtained as a concatenation of
sin(πpk2m) and cos(πpk2m), where k = 1, 2, 3 are the coordinate indices and m = 1, . . . , 4.

Training Objective. Following 3DGS [14], we use a combination of DSSIM [42] and L1 losses for
training (Eq. (3)). However, DSSIM and L1 are used for different purposes in our case. For DSSIM,
since it is more robust than L1 to appearance changes and focuses more on structure and perceptual
similarity, we apply it to the image rasterized without appearance modeling. On the other hand, we
use the L1 loss to learn the correct appearance. Specifically, let ˆC and ˜C be the rendered colors of
the rasterized image before and after the color toning (cf. Eq. (5)), respectively. Let C be the training
RGB image. The training loss can be written as:

Lcolor = λdssimDSSIM( ˆC, C) + (1 −λdssim)∥˜C −C∥1 .
(6)

In all our experiments we set λdssim = 0.2. During training, we first project the Gaussians into the 2D
image plane, compute the toned colors, and then rasterize the two images (toned and original colors).

Test-Time Optimization of Per-Image Embeddings ej. During training, we jointly optimize the
per-image embeddings ej and the per-Gaussian embedding gi, jointly with the 3DGS representation
and the appearance MLP. However, when we want to fit the appearance of a previously unseen image,
we need to perform test-time optimization of the unseen image’s embedding. To do so, we initialize
the image’s appearance vector as zeroes and optimize it with the main training objective (Eq. (6))
using the Adam optimizer [16] - while keeping everything else fixed.

3.3
Uncertainty Modeling for Dynamic Masking

To reduce the influence of transient objects and occluders, e.g., moving cars or pedestrians, on
the training process we learn an uncertainty model [24, 31]. NeRF On-the-go [31] showed that
using features from a pre-trained feature extractor, e.g., DINO [3, 27], increases the robustness of
the uncertainty predictor. However, while working well in controlled settings, the uncertainty loss
function cannot handle strong appearance changes (such as these in unconstrained image collections).
Therefore, we propose an alternative uncertainty loss which is more robust to appearance changes as
can be seen in Figure 3. During training, for each training image j, we first extract DINO v2 [27]
features. Then, our uncertainty predictor is simply a trainable affine mapping applied to the DINO
features, followed by the softplus activation function. Since the features are patch-wise (14 × 14px),

---Page Break---
we upscale the resulting uncertainty to the original size using bilinear interpolation. Finally, we clip
the uncertainty to the interval [0.1, ∞) to ensure a minimal weight is assigned to each pixel [24, 31].

Uncertainty Optimization. In the NeRF literature [24, 31], uncertainty modeling is realized by
letting the model output a Gaussian distribution for each pixel instead of a single color value. For
each pixel, let ˜C and C be the predicted and ground truth colors. Let σ be the (predicted) uncertainty.
The per-pixel loss function is the (shifted) negative log-likelihood of the normal distribution with
mean ˜C, and variance σ [24, 31]:

In [31], the squared differences are replaced by a slightly modified DSSIM, which was shown to
have benefits over the MSE loss used in [24]. Even though DSSIM has a different distribution than
MSE [42, 2], [31] showed that it can lead to stable training dynamics. Unfortunately, as shown in
Fig. 3, both MSE and DSSIM are not robust to appearance changes. This prevents these MSE-based
and SSIM-based methods [24, 31] from learning the correct appearance as the regions with varying
appearances are ignored by the optimization process. However, we can once more take advantage of
DINO features which are more robust to appearance changes, and construct our loss function from
the cosine similarity between the DINO features of the training image and the predicted image. Since
DINO features are defined per image patch, not pixel, we compute our uncertainty loss per patch. Let
˜D and D be the DINO features of the predicted and the training image patch. The loss is as follows:

Ldino( ˜D, D) = min

1, 2 −
2 ˜D · D
∥˜D∥2∥D∥2


,
(8)

where ‘·’ denotes the dot product. Note, that this loss function will be zero when the two features
have a cosine similarity of 1, and it will become 0 when the similarity drops below 1/2.

Finally, to optimize uncertainty, we also add the log prior resulting in the following per-patch loss:

Luncertainty = Ldino( ˜D, D)

2σ2
+ λprior log σ ,
(9)

where σ is the uncertainty prediction for the patch. We use this loss only to optimize the uncertainty
predictor (implemented as a single affine transformation) without letting the gradients propagate
through the rendering pipeline [31]. Further, during 3DGS training, the opacity is periodically
reset to a small value to prevent local minima. However, after each opacity reset, the renderings
are corrupted by (temporarily) incorrect alphas. To prevent this issue from propagating into the
uncertainty predictor, we hence disable the uncertainty training for a few iterations after each opacity
reset.

Optimizing 3DGS with Uncertainty. For NeRFs, one can use the uncertainty to directly weight
the training objective [24, 31]. In our experiments, we observed that this would not lead to stable
training as the absolute values of gradients are used in the densification algorithm and the excessively
large magnitudes of absolute gradients lead to excessive growth. The uncertainty weighting would
make the setup sensitive to the correct choice of hyperparameters. Therefore, to handle this issue, we
propose to convert the uncertainty scores into a (per-pixel) binary mask such that the gradient scaling
is at most one:

M = 1
 1

2σ2 > 1

,
(10)

where 1 is the indicator function which is 1 whenever the uncertainty multiplier is greater than 1.
This mask is then used to multiply the per-pixel loss defined in Eq. (6):

Lcolor-masked = λdssimM DSSIM( ˆC, C) + (1 −λdssim)M∥˜C −C∥1 .
(11)

3.4
Handling Sky

For realistic renderings of a scene under different conditions, modeling the sky is important (see
Fig. 1). It is unlikely that Gaussians are created in the sky when using Structure-from-Motion points
as initialization. Thus, we sample points on a sphere around the 3D scene and add them to the set of

points that is used to initialize the 3D Gaussians. For an even distribution of points on the sphere, we
utilize the Fibonacci sphere sampling algorithm [36], which arranges points in a spiral pattern using a
golden ratio-based formula. After placing these points on the sphere at a fixed radius rs, we project
them to all training cameras, removing any points not visible from at least one camera. Details are
included in the supp. mat.

Experiments

Datasets. We evaluate our WildGaussians approach on two challenging datasets. The NeRF On-
the-go dataset [31] contains multiple casually captured indoor and outdoor sequences, with varying
ratios of occlusions (from 5% to 30%). For evaluation, the dataset provides 6 sequences in total.
Note that there are almost no illumination changes across views in this dataset. Since 3DGS [14]
cannot handle radially distorted images, we train and evaluate our method and all baselines on a
version of the dataset where all images were undistorted. The Photo Tourism dataset [35] consists
of multiple 3D scenes of well-known monuments. Each scene has an unconstrained collection of
images uploaded by users captured at different dates and times of day with different cameras and
exposure levels. In our experiments we use the Brandenburg Gate, Sacre Coeur, and Trevi Fountain
scenes, which have an average ratio of occlusions of 3.5%. Note, that for each dataset (both NeRF
On-the-go and Photo Tourism), the test set was carefully chosen not to have any occluders.

Baselines. We compare our approach against a set of baselines. We use NerfBaselines [18] as
our evaluation framework, providing a unified interface to the original released source codes while
ensuring fair evaluation. On the NeRF On-the-go dataset, which contains little illumination changes,
we compare to NeRF On-the-go [31], the original 3DGS formulation [14], Mip-Splatting [50], and
Gaussian Opacity Fields [51]. On the Photo Tourism dataset [35], we compare against the most recent
state-of-the-art methods for handling strong illumination changes: NeRF-W-re [24] (open source
implementation), Ha-NeRF [4], K-Planes [9], RefinedFields [13], 3DGS [14], and concurrent works

occluders and shows the best view synthesis results.

GS-W [52] and SWAG [5]. We evaluate GS-W [52] using the NeRF-W evaluation protocol [24] (see
below). Our GS-W numbers thus differ from those in [52] (which conditioned on full test images).

Metrics. We follow common practice and use PSNR, SSIM [42], and LPIPS [53] for our evaluation.
For the Photo Tourism dataset [35], we use the evaluation protocol proposed in NeRF-W [24, 18],
where the image appearance embedding is optimized on the left half of the image. The metrics are then
computed on the right half. For the NeRF On-the-go dataset [31], there is no test-time optimization.
We also report training times in GPU hours as well as rendering times in frames-per-second (FPS),
computed on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 unless stated otherwise.

4.1
Comparison on the NeRF On-the-go Dataset

As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4, our approach significantly outperforms both baselines, especially for
scenarios with medium (15-20%) to high occlusions (30%). Compared to NeRF On-the-go [31], our
method is not only 400× faster in rendering, but can more effectively remove occluders. Moreover,
we can better represent distant and less-frequently seen background regions (first and third row
in Fig. 4). Interestingly, 3DGS and its derivatives (Mip-Splatting, Gaussian Opacity Fields) are quite
robust to scenes with low occlusion ratios, thanks to its geometry prior in the form of the initial point
cloud. Nevertheless, 3DGS and its derivatives struggles to remove occlusions for high-occlusion
scenes. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our uncertainty modeling strategy.

Comparision on Photo Tourism

Table 2 and Fig. 5 show results on the challenging Photo Tourism dataset. As for the NeRF On-the-go
dataset, our method shows notable improvements over all NeRF-based baselines, while enabling real-
time rendering (similar to 3DGS). Compared to 3DGS, we can adeptly handle changes in appearance

such as day-to-night transitions without sacrificing fine details. This shows the efficacy of our
appearance modeling. Compared to the NeRF-based baseline K-Planes [9], our method offers shaper
details, as can be noticed in the flowing water and text on the Trevi Fountain. Compared to 3DGS [14],
our method has comparable rendering speed on the NeRF On-the-go dataset, while being much faster
on the Photo Tourism dataset [35]. This is caused by 3DGS [14] trying to grow unnecessary Gaussians
to explain higher gradients due to the appearance variation. Finally, compared to other 3DGS-based
methods [52, 5], ours achieves stronger performance while having faster inference because we can
‘bake’ the apperance-tuned spherical harmonics back into the standard 3DGS representation.

4.3
Ablation Studies & Analysis

To validate the importance of each component of our method, we conduct an ablation study in Ta-
ble 3, separately disabling either uncertainty or appearance modeling. Table 3 shows that without
appearance modeling, performance significantly drops on the Photo Tourism dataset due to the
strong appearance changes captured by the dataset. On the NeRF On-the-go dataset, which exhibit

Figure 6: Appearance interpolation. We show how the appearance changes as we interpolate from a (daytime)
view to a (nighttime) view’s appearance. Notice the light sources gradually appearing.

appearance embedding as the camera moves around the fountain.

little to no illumination or other appearance changes, disabling appearance modeling only slightly
improves performance. We conclude that it is safe to use appearance embeddings, even if there might
not be strong appearance changes. Similarly, disabling uncertainty modeling has little impact on
datasets with less occlusions and could even make the performance slightly worse for the On-the-go
low dataset, but it is required for the high-occlusion datasets (On-the-go high and Photo Tourism).

Figure 8: t-SNE for Appearance Embedding. We
visualize the training images’ appearance embed-
dings using t-SNE. See the day/night separation.

As expected, for dataset with low occlusion ratios,
disabling uncertainty modeling has a limited impact
on the overall performance. We attribute this to the
inherent robustness of 3DGS, where the initial 3D
point clouds also help to filter out some occlusions.
However, as the occlusion ratio increases, the im-
portance of uncertainty modeling becomes evident.
This is shown by the significant performance drop
when using no uncertainty modeling for the NeRF
On-the-go high occlusion dataset.

Behavior of the appearance embedding. Fig. 6 in-
terpolates between two appearance embeddings. The
transition from the source view to the target view’s ap-
pearance is smooth, with lights gradually appearing.
This demonstrates the smoothness and the continu-
ous nature of the embedding space. In Fig. 7, we
interpolate between two camera poses with a fixed
appearance embedding showing multiview consis-
tency. Next, we further analyze the embedding space
with a t-SNE [39] projection of the embeddings of
training images. The t-SNE visualization in Fig. 8 reveals that the embeddings are grouped by image
appearances, e.g., with night images clustering together and being separated from other images.

Conclusion

Our WildGaussians model extends Gaussian Splatting to uncontrolled in-the-wild settings where
images are captured across different time or seasons, normally with occluders of different ratios. The
key to the success are our novel appearance and uncertainty modeling tailored for 3DGS, which also
ensures high-quality real-time rendering. We believe our method is a step toward achieving robust
and versatile photorealistic reconstruction from noisy, crowd-sourced data sources.

Limitations. While our method enables appearance modeling with real-time rendering, it is currently
not able to capture highlights on objects. Additionally, although the uncertainty modeling is more
robust than MSE or SSIM, it still struggles with some challenging scenarios. If there are not enough
observations of a part of the scene, e.g., because it is occluded in nearly all training images, our
approach will struggle to correctly reconstruct the region. One way to handle this is to incorporate
additional priors such as pre-trained diffusion models. We leave it as future work.

A.1
Implementation & Experimental Details

We base our implementation on the INRIA’s original 3DGS renderer [14], extended in Mip-Splatting
[50]. Furthermore, we extended the implementation by the AbsGaussian/Gaussian Opacity Fields
absolute gradient scaling fix [51, 49]. All our experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX
4090 GPU. For the uncertainty modeling, we use the ViT-S/14 DINO v2 features (smallest DINO
configuration) [27]. We also resize the images before computing DINO features to the max. size of
350 to make the DINO loss computation faster. To model the appearance, we use embeddings of size
24 for the Gaussians and 32 for the image appearance embeddings. For the appearance MLP, we use
2 hidden layers of size 128. We use the ReLU activation function. We use the Adam optimizer [16]
without weight decay. For test-time appearance embedding optimization, we perform 128 Adam’s
gradient descent steps with the learning rate of 0.1. For the main training objective λdssim to 0.2 and
λuncert to 0.5. We now describe the hyper-parameters used for the two datasets (Photo Tourism [35],
NeRF On-the-go [31]:

NeRF On-the-go Dataset. We optimize each representation for 30k training steps. For our choice of
learning rates, we mostly follow 3DGS [14]. We differ in the following learning rates: appearance
MLP lr. of 0.0005, uncertainty lr. of 0.001. Gaussian embedding lr. of 0.005. image embedding
lr. of 0.001. For the position learning rate, we exponentially decay from 1.6 × 10−4 to 1.6 × 10−6.
Furthermore, we set the densification threshold at 0.0002 and density from 500-th iteration to 15 000-
th iteration every 100 steps. Furthermore, we reset the opacity every 3 000 steps. We do not optimize
the uncertainty predictor for 500 after each opacity reset, and we do not apply the masking for the
first 2000 training steps.

Photo Tourism. We optimize each representation for 200k training steps. We use the following
learning rates: scales lr. of 0.0005, rotation lr. of 0.001, appearance MLP lr. of 0.0005, uncertainty lr.
of 0.001. Gaussian embedding lr. of 0.005. image embedding lr. of 0.001. For the position learning
rate, we exponentially decay from 1.6 × 10−5 to 1.6 × 10−7. We set the densification threshold at
0.0002 and density from 4000-th iteration to 100 000-th iteration every 400 steps. Furthermore, we
reset the opacity every 3 000 steps. We do not optimize the uncertainty predictor for 1500 after each
opacity reset. We do not use the uncertainty predictor for masking for the first 35 000 steps of the
training, and after that, we linearly increase its contribution for 5 000 steps.

Appearance MLP Priors. Considering that the appearance MLP shares weights across all Gaussians,
we observed potential instability in training when randomly initializing the MLP. To mitigate this, we
introduce a prior to the appearance MLP fθ, optimizing gradient flow during early training phases.
The raw output of the last layer of the MLP, (ˆβ, ˆγ), is adjusted to obtain the affine color transformation
in Eq. (5) as βk = 0.01 ˆβk and γk = 0.01 ˆγk + 1. This adjustment scales both the initialization of the
last layer and the learning rates of the MLP by 0.01, stabilizing early-stage training such that the
gradient wrt. SH coefficients is predominant.

Sky Initialization. We set the scene radius rs to the 97% quantile of the L2 norms of the centered
input 3D points. We then initialize a sphere at a distance of 10rs from the scene center [15]. For an
even distribution of points on the sphere, we utilize the Fibonacci sphere sampling algorithm [36],

points on the sphere and then project them to all training cameras, removing any points not visible
from at least one camera. This set of sky points is then added to our initial point set, with their opacity
initialized at 1.0, while the opacity of the rest is set at 0.1.

Figure 9: Photo Tourism ablation study. We show VastGaussian-style appearance modeling, no appearance
modeling, no uncertainty modeling, no Gaussian embeddings (only per-image embeddings), and the full method.

To further analyze the performance of the proposed contributions, we performed a detailed ablation
study of both the uncertainty prediction and appearance modeling. The results are presented in
Table 4. As we can see from the table, WildGaussians appearance modeling outperforms other
baselines. While VastGaussian [22] seems to work well for cases where the appearance difference is
small, it fails in cases with large appearance changes and causes noticeable artifacts in the images.
In the case of a simple affine color transformation (w/o Gaussian embeddings), this modeling is not

powerful enough to capture local appearance changes such as lamps turning on. We can also see the
effectiveness of the uncertainty modeling. However, for the Trevi Fountain, the uncertainty does not
improve the performance, which is likely caused by 1) the scene has a small number of occlusions, 2)
the water in the scene is often mistaken for a transient object as it is not multi-view consistent. For
reference, we also included a comparison with a method trained with explicit segmentation masks
obtained from the MaskRCNN predictor [11].

We also present qualitative results in Figure 9. Notice how VastGaussians leave noticeable artifacts in
the sky region in the first row. In the second row, notice how no appearance modeling or only using
image embeddings cannot represent the dark sky. Similarly, not using Gaussian embeddings causes
the method not to be able to represent shadows (row 2) and highlights (row 5). Disabling uncertainty
leads to noticeable artifacts in row 6.

To get some understanding of the types of occlusions present in the datasets, we visualize some images
from the datasets with various amounts of occlusions in Figure 10. While for Photo Tourism [35],
the occluders are humans looking into the camera in the bottom part of the images, for NeRF
On-the-go [31], we have humans and objects present in various regions of the images.
