Abstract

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents
capable of performing various sequential decision-making tasks. However, ef-
fectively guiding LLMs to perform well in unfamiliar domains like web naviga-
tion, where they lack sufficient knowledge, has proven to be difficult with the
demonstration-based in-context learning paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, called AUTOGUIDE, which addresses this limitation by automat-
ically generating context-aware guidelines from offline experiences. Importantly,
each context-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows
a conditional structure, clearly describing the context where it is applicable. As a
result, our guidelines facilitate the provision of relevant knowledge for the agent’s
current decision-making process, overcoming the limitations of the conventional
demonstration-based learning paradigm. Our evaluation demonstrates that AU-
TOGUIDE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex benchmark
domains, including real-world web navigation.

Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to address various
sequential decision-making tasks and applications [1, 2]. The foundation of these successes involves
the planning and reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, enabling agents to execute effective
policies [3, 4]. The predominant approach to leveraging these (typically closed source) models for
sequential decision making tasks is to provide demonstrations in the form of in-context examples.
However, direct application of this learning paradigm can be limited, especially in target domains
where the LLM has insufficient prior knowledge such as in web navigation, where LLM agents
generally achieve low success rates due to diverse and dynamic contents [5–8]. Providing all available
experiences as demonstrations to an agent can further be unsuccessful due to context length limitations,
prompt sensitivity, and difficulty with complex reasoning [9–12].

On the other hand, LLMs excel in interpreting concise instructions provided as natural language, an
ability that is also reinforced in the instruction-tuning phase of LLMs. Inpired by this, we explore
data-driven strategies that leverage offline experiences to extract actionable knowledge to help guide
LLM agents. As offline experiences implicitly convey valuable knowledge about desirable and
undesirable policies in domains, they promise to serve as a useful resource for improving an LLM
agent’s decision-making in situations where the pre-trained LLM lacks understanding. Despite this
potential benefit, a critical challenge lies in effectively extracting the implicit information embedded
in offline data.

Knowledge Extraction

Figure 1: AUTOGUIDE aims to extract the implicit knowledge embedded in offline experiences
and help the decision-making process of an LLM agent. Specifically, our method generates a
comprehensive set of context-aware guidelines from offline data and explicitly identifies when each
guideline is applicable by generating its corresponding context. Our context-aware guidelines enable
providing pertinent guidelines at test time by identifying the context of the current trajectory, leading
to correct decision-making compared to baselines without context-aware guidelines.

To address the challenge of extracting knowledge from offline data, we propose a novel framework,
called AUTOGUIDE. Specifically, AUTOGUIDE automatically derives a comprehensive set of context-
aware guidelines from offline experiences. Our method applies these context-conditional guidelines
to enhance the performance of an LLM agent by retrieving guidelines relevant to the agent’s current
state and incorporating them into the prompt during testing (see Figure 1). Notably, we generate
context-aware guidelines in concise natural language statements, effectively compressing knowledge
in offline data. Moreover, context-aware guidelines clearly describe the contexts where they are
applicable, so AUTOGUIDE enables an LLM agent to select pertinent guidelines for its current
decision-making process. As a result, AUTOGUIDE achieves the highest success rates compared to
competitive baselines in complex sequential decision-making benchmark environments.

Our contribution. In summary, we present the following main contributions in this paper:

• Principled method based on context-aware guidelines (Section 3): We develop two modules to
automatically generate context-aware guidelines from offline experiences: the context identification
module for identifying the context of a given trajectory, and the guideline extraction module for ex-
tracting a desired guideline corresponding to that context. The outcome is a set of domain knowledge
in concise natural language that enhances decision-making by providing pertinent information.
• Comprehensive evaluation of AUTOGUIDE (Section 4.2): We show AUTOGUIDE’s capability
in extracting helpful context-aware guidelines in various interactive benchmark domains, includ-
ing navigating real-world web domains (e.g., GitHub). Our results highlight the effectiveness of
AUTOGUIDE, which significantly outperforms baselines without context-aware guidelines.
• Analyses with important perspectives (Section 4.3): We study various aspects of AUTOGUIDE,
such as the significance of determining the applicability of each guideline based on generated contexts.
We also investigate the generalization ability of context-aware guidelines and demonstrate that our
guidelines enhance the performance across out-of-domain tasks.

need to possess various skills to be effective in practice including planning [3, 15, 16], reasoning
[4, 17], tool manipulation [18–21], code generation [22, 16], among others. In this work, we focus
on building effective agents for web [23, 8] and embodied [24] environments.

Self-reflection from past experiences. An important capability for agents to succeed is the ability
to learn from past experiences and update their behavior based on feedback. Self-feedback [25–27]
has emerged as an effective technique where a model inspects its own incorrect predictions, reflects
on it to identify what went wrong and attempts to improve its prediction. While self-feedback
provides intra-task (i.e., per-episode) knowledge within a task based on immediate feedback, our
approach offers an orthogonal and complementary aspect of inter-task knowledge (over multiple
tasks) by considering multiple train tasks in offline data. AutoGuide enhances learning efficiency and
credit assignment by utilizing detailed feedback from multiple tasks. However, these self-feedback
approaches are complementary to AUTOGUIDE and can be used in conjunction with our approach, as
shown in our experiments (see Section 4.2).

Leveraging natural language guidance. Natural Language can be a rich source of information
for agents to learn to act efficiently. Prior work has explored the notion of learning from human-
written text manuals, which describe details about the environment [28–30]. Recent work has
explored automatically generating such guidance in the form of chain-of-thought reasoning [4, 23],
which emulates a thought process or rationale for agent’s predictions. In contrast to approaches
which generate such guidance dynamically on the fly by imitating example guidance demonstrations
provided by a human, our approach carefully compares trajectories in offline data to generate
appropriate guidance and uses these guidelines for predicting better actions. ExpeL [31] proposed
a related approach to derive guidelines. In contrast to ExpeL, where all guidelines are provided to
an agent as a prompt, our guideline selection process is contextual, where guidelines relevant to the
agent’s current state are retrieved and used for prediction. We show that this substantially improves
over ExpeL’s non-contextual guideline-based approach.

AUTOGUIDE: Principled Method Based on Context-Aware Guidelines

Our work is motivated by the increasing availability of offline experiences that agents or humans
naturally accumulate through their interactions with the environment. AUTOGUIDE aims to leverage
this offline data to improve the decision-making of an LLM agent by generating helpful context-aware
guidelines. This section details how AUTOGUIDE automatically constructs these guidelines and
applies them to guide action generation at test time.

3.1
Problem Statement

Formally, AUTOGUIDE is given offline data Dtrain =(τ 1, ..., τ N) that consist of N trajectories from
training tasks. Each trajectory τ = (x0, a0, r0, ..., rT ) is a sequence of observations, actions, and
rewards following the partially observable Markov decision process [32]. The return of a trajectory is
defined as the sum of rewards obtained throughout the trajectory: R(τ)=PT
t=0 rt. The objective of
AUTOGUIDE is to distill knowledge from offline experiences into a useful natural language format,
such that the extracted information helps to maximize the expected return Eτ[R(τ)] during test time.

Extraction of Context-Aware Guidelines

AUTOGUIDE generates a set of context-aware guidelines by utilizing pairs of contrastive trajectories
from offline data. Each context-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows
a conditional structure, clearly describing the context in which the guideline is applicable. Intuitively,
contrasting a pair of trajectories with different returns provides important information about when and
which actions are effective or ineffective in maximizing expected returns. Building on this insight,
we develop two modules for automatically extracting context-aware guidelines (see Figure 2):

Context identification module. This module is responsible for abstracting the given partial trajectory
into its context, a concise natural language description of the agent’s state. More specifically, for
a timestep t and the corresponding trajectory τ i
:t := (x0, a0, ..., xt), we prompt LLMs to clearly
describe the agent’s status:

CONTEXT←Mcontext(τ i
:t),
(1)

Our prompt templates for the context identification module are shown in Appendix C.1.

Guideline extraction module. This module aims to generate a desired guideline corresponding
to a specific context. Let τ i
+ and τ i
−represent a contrasting pair of trajectories for the same task i
in offline data Dtrain, where R(τ i
+) > R(τ i
−). We want to contrast the pair of trajectories to find
desired behaviors at an important timestep. To do this, we compare these two trajectories to find the
deviation timestep t at which they begin to diverge due to different actions. Then we apply the context
identification module to summarize the context for the shared part of the trajectory τ i
:t. Eventually,
we extract a useful natural language guideline by examining the paired contrastive trajectories τ i
+
and τ i
−with respect to the context:

GUIDELINE←Mguideline(τ i
+, τ i
−, CONTEXT),
(2)

where we refer to Appendix C.2 for our prompt template. As an example, the paired trajectories in
Figure 2 deviate from timestep t = 0, for which the context is summarized as On the Reddit main
page. This module then generates the following context-aware guideline: When on the Reddit main
page, if you want to navigate to a specific forum, you should click on “link ‘Forums’” located right
above “link ‘Wiki’”.

Construction of context-aware guidelines. We collect context-aware guidelines G by iterating
through available pairs in the paired offline data and organize the guidelines in a dictionary format,
using the context as the key and the corresponding guidelines as the value (see Algorithm 1). In
particular, we observe that the context identification module occasionally produces contexts that
describe the same situation but are expressed slightly differently. To minimize redundancy, we
employ an LLM to determine if the current context corresponds to any previously identified context.

If a match is found, we reuse the existing context; otherwise, we introduce a new context into our
dictionary G. The specific prompt template for this context-matching procedure is in Appendix C.3.

3.3
Applying Context-Aware Guidelines at Test Time

After extracting a set of context-aware guidelines G from offline experiences, our method employs
these guidelines to enhance the decision-making of an LLM agent during testing. At each timestep,
AUTOGUIDE identifies the CONTEXT of the current test trajectory τ up to timestep t (which represents
the agent’s interactions up to the current time-step) using our context identification module Mcontext.
Our guideline selection module Mselect then selects relevant guidelines for CONTEXT from G.
More specifically, the module applies CONTEXT as the key to fetch a set of possible guidelines
G[CONTEXT]. If there are more than k guidelines in G[CONTEXT], Mselect prompts an LLM to
choose top-k guidelines for the specific τ:

RELEVANT GUIDELINES ←Mselect(CONTEXT, τ; G, k),
(3)

where Appendix C.4 details the prompt template for this selection procedure. Subsequently, AU-
TOGUIDE incorporates both the context and relevant guidelines into the agent’s action generation
prompt. Therefore, the agent selects an action by considering the provided context and guidelines (see
Figure 1 for an example). This process iterates until the end of the test trajectory (see Algorithm 2).

Key benefits of AUTOGUIDE. First, the extraction of context-aware guidelines in AUTOGUIDE
offers the inherent benefit of providing relevant guidelines for the context of interest. This capability
is important since neglecting the specific context in which a guideline applies can confuse the
agent’s decision-making process. The second key benefit is the generation of concise natural
language guidelines, which can be seamlessly incorporated into any prompt-based LLM agent. Lastly,
AUTOGUIDE generates guidelines at the individual context level rather than at the trajectory level.
Given that a single incorrect action can lead to a complete failure, it is essential to provide detailed
assistance in each action selection process. With these advantages, we demonstrate in the next section
that our approach significantly enhances the performance of LLM agents.

Evaluation

This section demonstrates the efficacy of AUTOGUIDE by conducting experiments on a diverse
suite of sequential decision-making benchmark domains. We also perform important analyses about

in-context learning, and generalization to out-of-domain tasks. We refer to Appendix B for additional
experimental details.

4.1
Evaluation Setup

4.1.1
Sequential Decision-Making Benchmark Domains

We consider the following interactive sequential decision-making benchmarks to study various aspects
of AUTOGUIDE (see Figure 3):

• ALFWorld [24]: In this embodied benchmark, an LLM agent interacts with an environment to
carry out household tasks, such as placing a pan on the dining table. Observations and actions
are expressed in natural language statements, and the agent must navigate through the space and
manipulate objects to successfully complete the tasks.

• WebShop [33]: This interactive web environment simulates the task of online shopping on an
e-commerce website. The agent’s goal is to understand a text instruction and buy a product that meets
specified criteria. This involves querying the website’s search engine, understanding the descriptions
and details of each item, and selecting necessary options.

• WebArena [8]: This web-based benchmark introduces realistic environments by replicating the
functionality and data found in popular web domains (e.g., Gitlab, Reddit, Wikipedia). Compared
to WebShop, WebArena presents more challenges and difficulties for an LLM agent due to its large
observation and action space, along with tasks that involve longer planning horizons. We focus oe the
Reddit domain for the main WebArena experiments.

• Real-world multi-modal websites: Finally, we consider evaluating AUTOGUIDE on a variety
of real-world website tasks. These span from a collaborative software development platform (e.g.,
GitHub) to a flight search engine (e.g., Google Flights) and an online education platform (e.g.,
Coursera). Please refer to Appendix B.4 for example tasks. In particular, in comparison to WebShop
and WebArena, we design our tasks to be multi-modal such that the agent must consider both visual
(e.g., images) and textual information (e.g., HTML) to complete these tasks.

4.1.2
Baselines

We compare AUTOGUIDE against the following baseline approaches to study the effect of context-
aware guidelines (refer to Appendix B for more details):

• ReAct [23]: This LLM-based planning method integrates reasoning and acting to address sequential
decision-making tasks. However, it does not leverage offline experiences and thus suffers from the
limited understanding of pre-trained LLMs in downstream domains.

• ExpeL [31]: This method also extracts natural language knowledge from offline data. However,
it fails to consider the applicability of guidelines and does not generate context-aware guidelines.
Instead, it provides all guidelines to an LLM agent without filtering out irrelevant ones based on
the current context. ExpeL has two contributions, the guideline generation and in-context example
selection module. Because the latter is orthogonal to our analysis and can be seamlessly combined
with our method, we consider ExpeL with guidelines in our experiments.

• Reflexion [27]: This approach converts environmental feedback into text statements to assist an
LLM agent (e.g., ReAct) in the next trial. The baseline generates valuable feedback about solving
a specific test task. We demonstrate how context-aware guidelines derived by AUTOGUIDE can be
combined with the feedback.

4.1.3
Implementation

We collect offline experiences either by running ReAct and Reflexion, or incorporating human
demonstrations. We use ReAct with GPT-3.5-turbo as our base LLM agent for WebShop and
ALFWorld and GPT-4-turbo for WebArena. For each benchmark, we apply the same GPT model for
action generation, context identification, and guideline selection. We extract context-aware guidelines
from offline data with GPT-4-turbo and evaluate their effectiveness by applying them to the test set
with non-overlapping tasks. We refer to Appendix B for more details.

Main Results

Q1. How effective is AUTOGUIDE compared to baselines without context-aware guidelines?

To answer this question, we compare methods on ALFWorld, WebShop, and WebArena benchmarks.
The performance on the test datasets is presented in Table 1. There are three notable observations:

1. Effectiveness of context-aware guidelines. Our approach surpasses baseline performance in
both ALFWorld and WebShop, achieving the highest test rewards and success rates in Table 1. These
results highlight the effectiveness of employing context-aware guidelines in language-based decision-
making domains. To further examine the action selection differences among ReAct, ExpeL, and our
method, we present their trajectories in Figure 4. We observed that ReAct makes common mistakes
such as trying to take soapbar that is not visible, or taking a soapbottle instead of soapbar due to their
similar names. Both ExpeL and AUTOGUIDE improve on this by extracting guidelines from similar
mistakes in the offline experience. However, ExpeL often erroneously applies incorrect guidelines

due to the availability of all guidelines at each timestep. In Figure 4, ExpeL mistakenly attends to the
second guideline “ensure to specify the item’s number and location ...”, leading to wrong reasoning
and action. AUTOGUIDE presents relevant guidelines at necessary moments, enabling accurate task
completion by avoiding the mistakes seen in ExpeL and ReAct.

2. Importance of providing pertinent knowledge. ExpeL approach helps ReAct by extracting
knowledge from offline experiences, but its impact is not as significant as AUTOGUIDE. Recall that
for ExpeL, the guidelines are neither generated for specific contexts at training time nor selected to
only provide context-aware guidelines at test time. As a result, irrelevant guidelines can be introduced
to an agent, potentially causing confusion for the agent. Consequently, the result highlights the
significance of providing relevant guidelines conditioned on contexts for LLM agents.

3. Scalability to complex environments. We conduct experiments on WebArena-Reddit, which
features more diverse tasks on realistic and complex websites requiring longer action sequences. This
domain has a larger observation space and a more complex action space (e.g., scrolling). Table 1
presents the results, where AUTOGUIDE achieves the highest success rate with a significant margin
when compared to ReAct and ExpeL. We observe that ReAct scores low task success rate (8.0%) in
WebArena due to the complex observation and action spaces and longer task horizon. In ExpeL, the
issue of presenting all guidelines to an agent is exacerbated in the WebArena compared to simpler
environments like ALFWorld and WebShop. WebArena’s wide variety of tasks across different
domains requires a larger number of guidelines to cover the knowledge needed for all tasks and
domains. This results in either an overload of irrelevant guidelines that could mislead the agent or a
lack of crucial information when the number of guidelines is limited, as suggested in ExpeL [31]. In
contrast, AUTOGUIDE achieves a more significant performance enhancement (47.1%) compared to
ExpeL (21.8%) by efficiently providing pertinent guidelines and minimizing the burden on context
capacity. We refer to Figure 14 for a list of example contexts and guidelines.

Q2. How does AUTOGUIDE perform when combined with test-time self-feedback approaches?

Our context-aware guidelines effectively provide inter-task knowledge by considering multiple tasks
in offline data. Meanwhile, self-feedback methods (e.g., Reflexion) offer intra-task knowledge
based on environmental feedback during test time. In this question, we explore the effectiveness of
integrating both inter-task and intra-task information. The results presented in Table 1 demonstrate that
the combination of AUTOGUIDE with Reflexion achieves the highest performance in the WebShop
and ALFWorld benchmarks. Hence, we find that our context-aware guidelines positively complement
the intra-task knowledge of Reflexion. Another observation from Table 1 is that, while ExpeL +
Reflexion outperforms ExpeL alone, this combination is not as effective as other approaches. This
limitation may stem from ExpeL introducing irrelevant knowledge, potentially leading to conflicts
with Reflexion’s feedback and having an adverse impact on the decision-making process.

Q3. Can AUTOGUIDE generate context-aware guidelines for multi-modal inputs?

Going beyond text-only inputs is an essential step toward building capable agents for solving real-
world environments and tasks. We test AUTOGUIDE in a complex multi-modal setting, where each
observation includes image and text information. Specifically, we introduce a set of real-world website
navigation tasks in 3 domains: GitHub, Google Flights, and Coursera. For these multi-modal tasks,
we employ the Set-of-Marks (SoM) agent [36, 5] as our base method. The SoM prompting improves
the visual grounding capabilities of large multi-modal models such as GPT-4V by adding visually
distinguishable marks to image inputs [36]. We apply AUTOGUIDE with GPT-4V to generate natural
language context-aware guidelines from collected trajectories with both image and text observations.

4.3
Analyses of AUTOGUIDE

Q4. How does AUTOGUIDE compare to ReAct with varying numbers of in-context examples?

Table 3 shows that, while increasing the number of in-context examples for ReAct gradually improves
performance, there is a plateau at a certain number of shots. Additionally, ReAct with more than 6
shots often exceeds the token limit of GPT-3.5-turbo. These results indicate that directly inputting
raw trajectories into ReAct for in-context learning is not an effective way to fully leverage offline
data. In contrast, AUTOGUIDE extracts knowledge from entire training trajectories by summarizing
them into concise context-aware guidelines, making them easy to integrate with prompt-based agents.

Q5. How does altering the number of top-k guidelines impact the performance of AUTOGUIDE?

We conducted an ablation study on WebShop using various values of k in Table 4. We find that
employing context-aware guidelines consistently outperforms the no-guideline baseline (k = 0;
ReAct). The k = 3 yields the best performance. The largest k value of 5 can lead an LLM agent to
overthink, potentially resulting in a slight decrease in performance. Conversely, a smaller k, like k=1,
may cause LLM to overlook additional helpful guidelines, leading to slightly worse performance.

Q6. How do AUTOGUIDE’s context-aware guidelines generalize to out-of-domain environments?

We conduct an experiment to further demonstrate AUTOGUIDE’s out-of-domain capability across
different domains but relevant tasks. We extract context-aware guidelines from WebShop and apply
them to WebArena-Shopping, which is a distinct domain with variations in observation/action spaces,
task intentions, and episodic horizons. For this domain adaptation case, we additionally incorporate a
grounding module to align the context-aware guidelines from WebShop to WebArena’s observations
based on GPT-4-Turbo. As shown in Table 5, the transferred guidelines bring a notable improvement
in success rates compared to the ReAct baseline in WebArena Shopping.

Q7. How does each component of AUTOGUIDE contribute to the final results?

We evaluate the impact of different components within AUTOGUIDE on its performance in WebShop,
as detailed in Table 6. We examine two variants: ReAct+CI and ReAct+GES. The ReAct+CI,
which incorporates contexts into observations without guidelines, shows improvement over ReAct.
This suggests that contexts enhance decision-making by verifying the current state before action
selection. ReAct+GES, which generates guidelines from trajectories without contexts and employs
GPT-3.5-turbo for guideline selection, also enhances performance but is less effective than the full
AUTOGUIDE. This indicates that choosing relevant guidelines based on the trajectory alone is more
challenging than using contexts. Therefore, integrating both context summaries and guidelines is
crucial for maximizing the benefits of AUTOGUIDE.

5
Conclusion

We present AUTOGUIDE, an effective framework for exploiting important domain knowledge from
offline experiences for improving decision-making with pre-trained LLMs. We proposed to generate
context-aware guidelines that can be incorporated into prompts for LLM agents. As AUTOGUIDE
extracts the guidelines by contrasting trajectories in offline data, the resulting context-aware guidelines
carry critical information for preventing failures in the domains. For inference, it provides the
guidelines pertinent to each of the different context that LLM agents encounter, which can make

pre-trained LLMs strong decision-making agents in the downstream domains. Empirically, we
showed that AUTOGUIDE outperforms strong baselines by a large margin and achieves outstanding
performance in decision-making benchmarks.

A
Limitation and Broader Impacts

Limitation. The performance of AUTOGUIDE depends on the diversity of offline experiences. As
such, one important direction for improvement is to automatically collect diverse offline experiences
through continual learning, where we iteratively generate guidelines and use them to gather more
trajectories with high rewards. Another avenue is the need for quantifying the quality of generated
contexts and guidelines. Currently, apart from applying context-aware guidelines to ReAct and
measuring test time performance, there lacks a standardized method for quantifying the quality of
generated contexts and selected guidelines. Introducing a quantifiable metric to approximate the
quality could pave the way for new optimization approaches such as reinforcement learning.

Broader impact. This paper introduces research aimed at enhancing the decision-making capabilities
of LLMs. In terms of societal impact, while we develop a generic LLM-based autonomous agent,
having biased offline datasets may lead to making decisions with suboptimal outcomes. Additionally,
autonomous agents may be misused for malicious applications. To mitigate these risks, potential
solutions would include diversifying datasets, implementing ethical oversight, ensuring transparency
and accountability, engaging with stakeholders for a broader perspective, and incorporating secu-
rity measures to prevent misuse. We believe that the research community, including ourselves,
should responsibly advance LLM-based agent research, prioritizing societal well-being and ethical
considerations.

Evaluation Details

B.1
ALFWorld [24]

B.1.1
Environment details

Each task in ALFWorld starts with a description of the specific environment and the goal to achieve.
At each timestep, an agent can choose one of the following actions to interact with the objects and
receptacles in the environment:

• go to [recep]
• take [object] from [recep]
• put [object] in/on [recep]
• open/close/use [recep]
• clean/heat/cool [object] with [recep]

Alternatively, the agent can generate a think action for planning and reflection, which helps with
decision-making but does not change the environment itself. After one action is performed, the
environment returns an observation that describes view changes.

Following ReAct, we concatenate a list of (observation, action) pairs to show the entire trajectory
up to the current timestep for LLM agents to generate the next action. We experiment on 134 un-
seen test tasks with 6 categories of pick and place, pick clean then place, pick heat then place,
pick cool then place, look at obj, and pick two obj. For each task, the agent is allowed to take a
maximum of 50 actions.

B.1.2
Baseline and Models

For ALFWorld tasks, we follow the same setting as ReAct by providing 2 in-context examples for
each of the 6 task categories. The original results of ReAct in their paper are produced based on
Text-Davinci-002. However, this GPT version is no longer available, so we apply gpt-3.5-turbo-
instruct instead to generate actions. For ExpeL, we directly take the guidelines from their appendix
and append them to the ReAct agent at test time.

B.1.3
Implementation details ofAUTOGUIDE

We run the first 100 training tasks of ALFWorld to collect (τ+, τ−) pairs with ReAct+Reflexion and
extract context-dependant guidelines on the collected data. For context identification, we provide

2-shot demonstrations for each of the 6 task categories. The corresponding prompt templates can be

B.2
WebShop [33]

B.2.1
Environment details

WebShop provides an e-commerce environment, where the objective is to find and buy the product
that matches the task-specific Instruction. The agent can select one of the following actions to
perform:

• search[query]
• click[button]

Following ReAct, the agent can generate think actions to do planning or reflection. After buying a
product, the environment returns a reward showing how well the bought product matches the target
one in type, price, buying options, and attributes. The reward is calculated by:

r=rtype · |Uatt ∩Yatt|+|Uopt ∩Yopt|+1[yprice ≤uprice]

|Uatt|+|Uopt|+1

where y is the bought product and u is the target product. Same as ALFWorld, for WebShop, the
agent takes (obst, actt) pairs for every previous timestep t as input to generate the next action.

B.2.2
Baseline and Models

Following ReAct, experiments are done in a one-shot setting. We apply gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to
generate actions, but when the token number exceeds the token limit (for example, for the n-shot
ReAct experiments in table 1), we use the 16k version of gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 instead. For ExpeL, we
could not find how many training tasks the framework used for training. Therefore, we directly apply
the guidelines from the appendix of their paper at test time. We only consider ExpeL with guidelines,
not ExpeL with in-context example selection in our experiments for a fair comparison. The in-context
example selection method is orthogonal to our work and can be easily combined with our method.
For Reflexion, as shown in their paper, their 2-shot Reflexion prompt does not work well on WebShop.
Therefore, we re-write the prompt and apply gpt-4-1106-preview to generate episode-level reflections
for all Reflexion experiments. Following Reflexion and ExpeL, the evaluation is done on 100 test
tasks. The maximum number of allowed actions for each task is 15. At the same time, each search
action shows the top 3 products for the search query. Please refer to Table 8 for more details about
the experiments.

B.2.3
Implementation details of AUTOGUIDE

We randomly sample 50 training tasks from the training set of WebShop, on which we run Re-
Act+Reflexion to collect pairs and generate guidelines. The context identification prompt is one-shot,
which is shown in Appendix C. At test time, we ask gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to select each state’s most
relevant top 2 guidelines.

B.3
WebArena [8]

B.3.1
Environment details

WebArena provides web-based benchmark environments that closely follow the data and functionality
of real-world websites. Unlike other benchmarks like WebShop that provide clean text of website
information as observation, WebArena’s webpage content is represented as an accessibility tree,
which is a subset of the DOM tree with useful elements of a webpage. For our expeirments, we focus
on WebArena Reddit, which simulates the real Reddit websites with users, forums, and posts with
abundant text information.

For each task in WebArena, the agent is expected to achieve a task-specific intent. At each timestep,
WebArena provides a list of opened tabs, the accessibility tree of the focused webpage, and the URL
of the current page as observation. For WebArena, each observation is long. Therefore, following the
baseline in WebArena, at each timestep, we only provide the observation of the current timestep to
the agent. We additionally provide up to 5 past actions for the agent to understand what it did in the
past. The allowed actions in WebArena include the following:

• goto [url]

• click [element id]

• type [element id] [text] [1 for enter or 0 for not enter]

• press [key combination]

• scroll [up or down]

• go back

The maximum allowed number of actions for a single task is 20. Note that WebArena does not provide
training tasks, but the work provides 19 demonstrations for Reddit, each of a different category.
Therefore, we set these 19 tasks as the training tasks and then test on the rest 87 tasks.

B.3.2
Baseline and Models

We directly run the two-shot ReAct-style baseline in the official codebase of WebArena using gpt4-
preview-1106. For ExpeL, the original paper does not include experiments on WebArena, therefore
we try our best to implement our own version and run on the same training tasks as our method.

B.3.3
Implementation details of AUTOGUIDE

We directly run ReAct on the tasks with τ+ to collect τ−actions and generate guidelines correspond-
ingly. We provide a 5-shot prompt for the context identification module, which is shown in Figure 7.
At test time, the top 2 guidelines at each timestep are selected to guide action generation.

Real Websites

B.4.1
Environment details

We design a set of real-world website navigation tasks from 3 domains: Software Development
(GitHub), Travel (Google Flights), and Education (Coursera), which have 30, 20, and 20 test tasks
accordingly. Here are some example tasks:

• GitHub
– Navigate to the repository for the Python library Seaborn with the most stars and show me all
the open issues labeled with bug.
– Go to the GitHub org for Spotify and open the pinned project with the most stars for me.
• Google Flights
– Find me the one-way flight from Hong Kong to Paris departing on Oct 15th 2024 with the least
emmisions.
– Show me the booking options of the one-way flight departing from Auckland on September 11,
2024, and arriving in Rome with the earliest departure time on that day.
• Coursera
– Show me a Cybersecurity course that can finish within 1 month and show me all the reviews for
the selected course.
– Find me a Coursera guided project that covers Unity and show me its main page.

We follow the action space design of Visual WebArena [5], which has the following action types
available:

• goto [url]
• click [element id]
• hover [element id]
• type [element id] [text] [1 for enter or 0 for not enter]
• press [key combination]
• scroll [up or down]
• tab focus [tab index]
• close tab
• go back
• go forward

As the real websites are constantly and dynamically changing, we evaluate the completed task with
human experts.

B.4.2
Baseline and Models

We directly run the two-shot SoM algorithm in the official codebase of Visual WebArena. The
only modification we made from the original codebase is the bounding box detection algorithm, in

16


---Page Break---
which we further filter invisible bounding boxes from the list and add the list elements as interactable
elements to consider.

B.4.3
Implementation details of AUTOGUIDE

We provide a total of 6 training tasks (3 for GitHub, 2 for Google Travel, and 1 for Coursera), on
which we collect human demonstration as τ+’s and run SoM to collect τ−’s. From the pairs with
multi-modal observations we generate text-based guidelines to guide action selection. Both context
identification and guideline extraction are done by gpt-4-vision-preview, and we provide a 3-shot
prompt for context identification. All parameter details are shown in Table 10.

Prompt Templates

C.1
Context Identification

We present our prompt templates for the context identification module Mcontext (Equation (1)) for
WebShop, ALFWorld, and WebArena in Figures 5 to 7, respectively. In ALFWorld, there exist six
categories of tasks, and we use context identification prompting with 2-shot examples for each task,
following the practice by [23]. Figure 6 shows one example for the pick and place tasks.

C.2
Guideline Extraction

Figures 8 to 10 detail our prompt templates Mguideline for extracting guidelines (Equation (2)) in the
WebShop, ALFWorld, and WebArena domains.

C.3
Context Matching

Figure 11 shows our prompt template for matching the generated context with one of the existing
contexts if there is any similar context, for the construction of the set of context-aware guidelines
(Section 3.2) and the retrieval of relevant guidelines during testing (Section 3.3) in all the three
domains: WebShop, ALFWorld, and WebArena.

C.4
Guideline Selection

For selecting only k most relevant guidelines in case there are more corresponding context-aware
guidelines during testing (Equation (3)), we use the prompt with Figure 12 for WebShop and
ALFWorld and Figure 13 for WebArena.

D
Example Context-Aware Guidelines

In Figures 14 and 15, we show a list of possible contexts and context-aware guidelines on WebArena
and real-world websites, respectively.

You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be provided with the following 
information: 
1. A list of context summarizations you have seen in the past. 
2. A snippet of the current web page's accessibility tree: a simplified representation of the webpage with key information and 

the current web pages' URL.  
Please generate the summarization of the current observation after 'SUMMARIZATION:’.  
Here are some requirements:  
Requirement 1: Different types of webpages should have clearly different summarizations. For example, for GitHub there can 
be the main page of GitHub, the overview page of a GitHub user, the issues page of a GitHub repository, the search result page 
of GitHub. etc, you should clearly categorize those and make sure not to mix them up. 
Requirement 2: Important: The summarization should be general, and concise, without any user/object/task specific 
information, instead, websites that fall into the same categories should have the same summarization, for example, the main 
page of every reddit forum should be categorized as the same context summarization: On the main page of a Reddit forum. You 
should never include the specific name of the forum in the summarization.  
Requirement 3: The URLs will be very useful for you to determine the summarization. 
Requirement 4: If the context is the same as one from the seen list, directly copy the best matching one word by word.

{Task description}. You will be provided with a desired and undesired trajectory of the same task. What is the first action that 
differs between the two trajectories? Why do you think it makes one trajectory failed and the other successful? Based on your 
answer, generate an action guideline to make future task avoid the same mistake. The guideline should specify what to do in 
what situation in the format of "When in what status, you should (or should not)...". On a product's page with product 
information, strictly refer to the option buttons as 'buying options such as sizes, colors, scents, and flavors', and clearly say that 
buying options are not subpages like [Description] and [Attributes] when you mention buying options. Your guideline must be 
general enough for any task, therefore never include any task-specific information, instead, refer to all the requirements as the 
requierments in Instruction. Strictly follow what the desired trajectory does and never suggest actions that the desired 
trajectory didn't do. When referring to actions, use the allowed action format. You should make your answer concise, limit your 
answer within 256 tokens, and put your answer in this format: 'Reasoning: ...

Guideline Extraction Prompt for WebArena

{Task description}
You just finished a task but failed. For this failed task, we 
provide a human demonstration for you. Please compare 
the demonstration with your generated action at each step, 
reason about the intention of the correct action, and then 
geneate an action guideline for future tasks to avoid the 
same mistake and make the future tasks successful. 

Here's the information you'll have:
1. The current observation:
* The task objective: the task you're trying to complete.
* The current web page's accessibility tree: a simplified 
representation of the webpage, providing key information.
* The current web page's URL: the link of the page you're 
currently on.
* The open tabs: the tabs you have opened.
* The previous actions: a sequence of past actions that you 
performed.

2. The action you generated in the failed run. 

3. The correct action that you should take.

4. Demonstration actions in later steps on the same page.

Based on the information, please generate a short and 
concise guideline that guide you to issue the correct action. 
Important: The guideline should be general enough to 
generalize to all similar tasks, not only this task. Therefore 
do not include any task-specific information in your 
guideline, for example a user name, a specific forum, the 
specific text you want to enter, or any number ID in [] in 
front of each element, for example [123], the numbers are 
randomly generated therefore never include them in your 
guideline. However, for other non-specific elements like

"link 'Forums'" or "button 'Create submission'", you should 
specifically include them in the exact text in your guideline. 
When referring to a url in your guideline, specify it as 
detailed as possible, only replace the task specific 
information as a palceholder, for example, replace a forum 
iphone with <forum_name> and specify the url in full, starts 
with http://. 
The guideline should be less than 128 tokens.
Please refer to "the previous actions" and "Demonstration 
actions in later steps" to generate more accurate 
descriptions of your purpose and the sequence of actions to 
achieve the purpose. make sure to emphasize the order of 
the actions, do not miss any single action, and put them in 
1. 2. 3. ..., for example 'after you typed in all the text, you 
should do these sequentially: 1. ..., 2. ... . You must strictly 
follow the order." 
When you mention multiple steps of actions, also mention 
in the guideline that you should refer to the PREVIOUS 
ACTIONS to reason about which actions you did and what 
you should do next. Specify that you should not repeatedly 
issue the same action, but should move on to the next 
action instead. 
Only speicify what to do or what not to do, don't explain 
why. 
It is important to clearly specify when to issue a stop action 
when the stop action is either the correct action or in the 
'Demonstration actions in later steps on the same page.', do 
not specify the 'answer' in 'stop [answer]' because answer is 
different for different tasks, and do not mention anything 
about stop if this action is neither in "The correct action that 
you should take." nor "Demonstration actions in later steps 
on the same page.". 
Please strictly adhere to the 'correct action that you should 
take', do not propose other actions.

extracting context-aware guidelines from offline data to enhance the decision-making of
LLM-based agents. We support the effectiveness of our method through empirical evalua-
tions in Section 4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We outline potential limitations of AUTOGUIDE in Appendix A.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is
low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical contributions.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 4.1 and Appendix B provide detailed information (e.g., model ver-
sions, hyperparameters, number of training data) for reproducing our experimental results.
Additionally, Appendix C contains our prompt templates.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the
code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be
necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset,
or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good
way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions
for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large
language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to
the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

26


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We intend to release the source code upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized ver-
sions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We detail our experimental settings in Section 4.1 and Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We provide the average rewards and success rates calculated across test tasks
in our results, but we do not include the variance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run
with given experimental conditions).

27


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error
rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our experiments are based on GPT, and we detail the versions of GPT in
Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our work conforms the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration
due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the broader impacts of our work in Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact
or why the paper does not address societal impact.

28


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g.,
deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups),
privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a
generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that
generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mecha-
nisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback
over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper makes the algorithmic contribution and does not release new data
or models.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We reference the original papers and sources throughout the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service
of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated
licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a
dataset.

29


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset
is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution
of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included
in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
