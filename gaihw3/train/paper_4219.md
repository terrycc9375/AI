Abstract

Novel-view synthesis aims to generate novel views of a scene from multiple input
images or videos, and recent advancements like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS)
have achieved notable success in producing photorealistic renderings with efficient
pipelines. However, generating high-quality novel views under challenging settings,
such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to insufficient information in
under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. This paper presents
3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing the representation quality of
3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video diffusion priors to address the
challenging 3D view consistency problem, reformulating it as achieving temporal
consistency within a video generation process. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-
consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the
input views through a spatial-temporal decoder. The enhanced views are then
used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, significantly improving its rendering
performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of unbounded scenes
demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yields superior reconstruction performance and
high-fidelity rendering results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The project

Introduction

Novel-view synthesis (NVS) has decades of history in computer vision and graphics communities,
aiming to generate views of a scene from multiple input images or videos. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) [18] has excelled in producing photorealistic renderings with a highly efficient
rendering pipeline. However, rendering high-quality novel views far from existing viewpoints remains
very challenging, as often encountered in sparse-view settings, due to insufficient information in
under-sampled areas. As shown in Figure 1, noticeable ellipsoid-like and hollow artifacts manifest
when there are only three input views. Due to these common low-quality rendering results in practice,
it is essential to enhance 3DGS to ensure its viability for real-world applications.

To our knowledge, few prior studies have specifically focused on enhancement methods aimed at
improving the rendering quality of NVS. Most existing enhancement work for NVS [19, 44] focuses
on incorporating additional geometric constraints such as depth and normal into the 3D reconstruction
process to fulfill the gap between the observed and unobserved regions. For example, DNGaussian
[19] applies a hard-and-soft depth regularization to the geometry of radiance fields. However, these
methods heavily rely on the effectiveness of additional constraint and are often sensitive to noises.
Another line of work leverages generative priors to regularize the NVS pipeline. For instance,
ReconFusion [41] enhances Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [26] by synthesising the geometry and
texture for the unobserved regions. Although it can generate photo-realistic novel views, the view
consistency is still challenging when the generated views are far away from the input ones.

In this work, we exploit the 2D generative priors, e.g., the latent diffusion models (LDMs) [32],
for 3DGS representation enhancement. LDM has demonstrated powerful and robust generation
capabilities in various image generation [32] and restoration tasks [43]. Nevertheless, the main
challenge lies in the poor 3D view consistency among generated 2D images, which significantly
hinders the 3DGS training process that requires highly precise view consistency. Although some
efforts have been made, such as the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss [30] that distills the
optimization objective of a pre-trained diffusion model, it fails to generate the 3D representation
allowing rendering high-fidelity images

Motivated by the analogy of the visual consistency between multi-view images and the temporal
consistency between video frames, we propose to reformulate the challenging 3D consistency problem
as an easier task of achieving temporal consistency within video generation, so we can leverage the
powerful video diffusion models for restoring high-quality and view-consistent images. We propose a
novel 3DGS enhancement pipeline, dubbed 3DGS-Enhancer. The core of 3DGS-Enhancer is a video
LDM consisting of an image encoder that encodes latent features of rendered views, a video-based
diffusion model that restores temporally consistent latent features, and a spatial-temporal decoder
that effectively integrates the high-quality information in original rendered images with the restored
latent features. The initial 3DGS model will be finetuned by these enhanced views to improve its
rendering performance. The proposed 3DGS-Enhancer can be trajectory-free to reconstruct the
unbound scenes from sparse views and generate the natural 3D representation for the invisible area
between two known views. A cocurrent work V3D [7] also leverages latent video diffusion models
[4] for generating object-level 3DGS models from single images. In contrast, our 3DGS-Enhancer
focuses on enhancing any existing 3DGS models and thus can be applied to more generalized scenes,
e.g., the unbounded outdoor scenes.

In experiments, we generate large-scale datasets with pairs of low-quality and high-quality images
on hundreds of unbounded scenes, based on DL3DV [21], for comprehensively evaluating the
novelly investigated 3DGS enhancement problem. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
3DGS-Enhancer method achieves superior reconstruction performance on various challenging scenes,
yielding more distinct and vivid rendering results. The code and the generated dataset will be publicly
available. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.

1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the problem of enhancing low-
quality 3DGS rendering results, an issue that widely exists in practical 3DGS applications.

2. We propose a novel pipeline 3DGS-Enhancer that addresses the 3DGS enhancement prob-
lem. 3DGS-Enhancer reformulates the 3D-consistent image restoration task as temporally
consistent video generation, such that powerful video LDMs can be leveraged for gener-
ating both high-quality and 3D-consistent images. Novel 3DGS fine-tuning strategies are

also devised for an effective integration of the enhanced views with the original 3DGS
representation.

3. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of unbounded scenes to demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed methods over existing state-of-the-art few-shot NVS
methods.

Radiance fields for novel view synthesis. Novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to generate unseen
viewpoints from a set of input images and camera information. Radiance fields methods, like NeRFs
[26], encode 3D scenes as radiance fields and use volume rendering for novel views, achieving
high-fidelity results but at the cost of lengthy training and inference times. Improvements such
as Mip-NeRF [1, 2] enhance rendering quality through anti-aliasing, while others [6, 9, 47, 27]
focus on speeding up the processes. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) [18] has emerged,
offering competitive rendering quality and significantly higher efficiency by representing scenes as 3D
Gaussian spheres and using a fast differentiable splatting pipeline [50]. However, 3DGS still requires
high-quality and numerous input views for optimal reconstruction, which is often impractical.

Few-shot novel view synthesis. Leveraging additional information is essential for generating novel
views from sparse input images. Various approaches incorporate different regularization techniques to
prevent 3D geometry from overfitting to the training views. [19, 10, 28, 23] introduce extra geometric
information, such as depth maps or coarse mesh, to enhance the robustness and performance of 3D
reconstruction from sparse views. [5, 8] leverage the learned priors from multi-view stereo datasets as
general priors to improve performance in sparse view reconstruction tasks. FreeNeRF [44] integrates
frequency and occlusion regularization during training to mitigate overfitting issues in few-shot neural
rendering. Similarly, DietPixelNeRF [16] employs a semantic view consistency loss to ensure that
all views share consistent semantics, thereby alleviating overfitting. However, these methods are
highly sensitive to the network’s performance, where incorrect depth estimations or inaccurate mesh
reconstructions can significantly degrade the final output.

Diffusion priors for novel view synthesis. Recently, utilizing diffusion models as priors for few-shot
novel view synthesis has proven to be an effective approach. DreamFusion [30] employs Score
Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a pre-trained diffusion model to guide 3D object generation from
text prompts [36, 33, 46]. Some works [22, 34, 35] embed 3D awareness into 2D diffusion models to
generate multi-view images, though these methods typically require large datasets [49] and significant
training resources [16, 28]. ReconFusion [41] leavarge the 2D diffusion priors to recover a high-
fidelity NeRF from sparse input views. More advanced approaches leverage video diffusion models
[4, 12, 13, 24] for few-shot NVS. For instance, AnimateDiff [11] fine-tunes diffusion models with
additional camera motions using LoRA [14], while methods like SVD-MV [4], V3D [37] and IM-3D
[24] propose camera-controlled video diffusion models for object-level 3D generation. In contrast,
our approach offers greater generalizability for unbounded outdoor scenes.

Radiance fields enhancement. Several existing studies focus on enhancing NeRFs by addressing
the limited detail preservation issue caused by insufficient or low-quality input data. NeRF-SR [38]
and Refsr-nerf [15] use a super-resolution network to upscale the training view images, allowing
novel views to be synthesized at higher resolutions with appropriate details. Alignerf [17] introduce
optical-flow network to solve the misalignment problem to enhance the performance. Some other
approaches incorporate 2D diffusion priors into 3D reconstructions. For instance, DiffusionNeRF
[42] leverages a diffusion model to learn gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors, serving as
regularized geometry and color for a scene. Nerfbusters [40] use diffusion priors to remove ghostly
artifacts in the 3D gaussians. Our work aim to addresses the radiance fields enhancement problem
by proposing a novel framework 3DGS-Enhancer, achieving superior enhancement performance for
low-quality unbounded 3DGS representations.

where Σ = RSST RT , S is the scaling matrix determined by s and R is the rotation matrix determined
by q. To additionally model the view-dependent appearance, the Gaussian sphere also includes
spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients C ∈Rk, where k is the number of SH functions, and an α ∈R
for opacity. The color and opacity are also calculated by the Gaussian distribution illustrated in Eq. 1.

For rendering, all the 3D Gaussian spheres are projected onto the 2D camera planes via a differentiable
Gaussian splatting pipeline [50]. Given the viewing transform matrix W and Jacobian matrix J of the
affine approximation of the projective transformation, the covariance matrix Σ′ in camera coordinates
is calculated as
Σ′ = JWΣW T JT .

The differentiable splatting method efficiently projects the 3D Gaussian spheres to 2D Gaussian
distributions, ensuring fast α-blending for rendering and color supervision. For each pixel, the color

3DGS-Enhancer: An Overview

This work studies the 3DGS enhancement problem. More specifically, given a 3DGS model
trained on a scene consisting of input views {Iref
1 , Iref
2 , . . . , Iref
Nref} and corresponding camera
poses {pref
1 , pref
2 , . . . , pref
Nref}, the goal of this work is to enhance a set of low-quality novel views
{I1, I2, I3, . . . , INnew} rendered by the 3DGS model. The enhanced images further fine-tune the
3DGS model to improve its reconstruction and rendering quality.

This work novelly reformulates the challenging task of 3D-consistent image restoration as the task of
video restoration, in light of the analogy between the multi-view consistency and the video temporal
consistency. We propose a novel framework named 3DGS-Enhancer that employs a video LDM
comprising an image encoder, a video-based diffusion model, and a spatial-temporal decoder to
enhance the rendered images while preserving a high 3D consistency. 3DGS-Enhancer also adopts
novel fine-tuning strategies to selectively integrate the views enhanced by the video LDM into the
3DGS fine-tuning process. An illustration of the 3DGS-Enhancer framework is shown in Figure 2.
We discuss more details of the framework in the following.

Video Diffusion Prior for Temporal Interpolation

In this section, we introduce the video diffusion model for achieving 3D-consistent 2D image
restoration. To lift the consistency between the generated 2D video frames and the high-quality
reference views, we further propose to formulate the video restoration task as a video interpo-
lation task, where the first frame and the last frame of inputs to the video diffusion model are
two reference views. This formulation provides stronger guidance for the video restoration pro-
cess. Let {pref
i−1, ps
1, ps
2, . . . , ps
T , pref
i } be the camera poses sampled from the trajectory fitted be-
tween two reference views, the images rendered accordingly are v = {Iref
i−1, I1, I2, . . . , IT , Iref
i }.
v ∈R(T +2)×3×H×W serves as the input to the video diffusion model, e.g., a pre-trained image-
guided stable video diffusion (SVD) model [4, 20] that adopts cross-frame spatio-temporal attention
module and 3D residual convolution in the diffusion U-Net. Unlike SVD, which repeats the single
input image feature extracted by CLIP [31] for T times as the conditional inputs, we input v to the
CLIP encoder to get a sequence of conditional inputs cclip and add it to the video diffusion model
through cross attention. Meanwhile, we input v to the VAE encoder to get latent feature cvae and
add it into the diffusion model through a classifier-free guidance strategy to incorporate richer color
information. The diffusion U-Net ϵθ predicts the noise ϵ for each diffusion step t, and the training
objective is
Ldiffusion = E [∥ϵ −ϵθ(zt, t, cclip, cvae)∥] .
(4)
where zt = αtz + σtϵ ∗.. where z is the gt latent, ϵ ∈N(0, I), αt and σt define a noise at timestep t.
The learned video diffusion model generates a sequence of enhanced image latents zv corresponding
to the rendered low-quality views v.

4.3
Spatial-Temporal Decoder

Although the video diffusion model can generate enhanced image latents zv, we observe that there
are artifacts such as temporal inconsistency, blurring, and color shift in outputs of the original decoder
of video LDM. To address this issue, we propose a modified spatial-temporal decoder (STD). STD
makes the following improvements over the original VAE Decoder: 1) Temporal decoding manner.
STD adopts additional temporal convolution layers to ensure the temporal consistency between
decoded outputs. Similar to our video diffusion model, the first and the last input frames are the
reference view images, and the intermediate inputs are the generated views; 2) Effective integration
of rendered views. STD adopts additional conditional inputs, same as those of the video diffusion
model, allowing the decoder to better leverage the original rendered images. Inspired by [45, 48],
these conditional inputs are fed into STD through Controllable Feature Warping (CFW) modules
[39], such that their high-frequency patterns are better preserved. 3) Color correction. To address
the color shift issue, we apply color normalization to the decoded images by following StableSR
[39]. However, we observe that highly blurred and low-quality images in the conditional inputs can
undermine the color correction effects. To mitigate this, we use the first reference view to calculate
the mean and variance, and then align all the other decoded images with this reference view. Let
Ig
i be the i-th decoded images with a mean uˆIg
0 and a variance σˆIg
0 , ˆIg
0 be the reference view with a
mean µIg
i and a variance σIg
i , the corrected image Ic
i is computed by:

Ic
i =
Ig
i −µIg
i
σIg
i
· σˆIg
0 + uˆIg
0 .
(5)

The optimization objective of STD consists of an L1 reconstruction loss and an LPIPS perceptual
loss between Ig and ground-truth ˆIg, and an adversarial loss, as

LSTD = Lrec(Ig, ˆIg) + LLPIPS(Ig, ˆIg) + Ladv(Ig).
(6)

where Ladv is the adversarial loss that discriminates between real image ˆIg and fake image Ig.

Fine-tuning Strategies of 3D Gaussian Splatting

Confidence-aware 3D Gaussian splatting.
Unlike existing sparse-view NVS methods, our ap-
proach does not rely on depth estimation networks for depth regularization. Instead, we take a purely
2D visual method by utilizing a video diffusion model to enhance images rendered from a low-quality
3DGS model. Despite this significant enhancement in the quality of the rendered views, we propose

Figure 3: The red circle indicates the area with high confidence, meaning the generated videos
can contribute more information. Conversely, the green quadrilateral highlights the area with low
confidence, suggesting that the generated video should not tend to optimize this area.

to rely more on the reference views rather than the restored novel views when fine-tuning the 3DGS
model, since the 3DGS model is highly sensitive to slight inaccuracies in the restored views. These
inaccuracies could be amplified during the fine-tuning process.

To minimize the negative impact of generated images on Gaussian training, we propose confidence-
aware 3D Gaussian splatting. This strategy involves two levels of confidence, image level and pixel
level. For the image level, the generated images that are closer to real images have lower confidence.
For pixel level, the larger the mean covariance of all the Gaussians used to render this pixel, the
higher its confidence.

Image level confidence.
In the task of novel view synthesis, if noise exists in two image views,
a close distance between them increases the likelihood of generating conflicts and disrupting the
3D consistency of the scene. Therefore, for novel views that are close to the reference view, it is
crucial to carefully optimize the 3D Gaussians to mitigate the adverse effects of noise. Conversely,
when a novel view is far from all known views, it has a smaller likelihood of disturbing already
well-reconstructed areas. Based on this reasoning, we normalize the distance from novel views to
reference views between 0 and 1. The farther a viewpoint is from the reference view, the higher its
confidence.

Pixel level confidence.
Inspired by ActiveNeRF [29], which uses Gaussian distributions in NeRF
to estimate uncertainty and identify views with the highest information gain, we aim to find the
pixels that can provide the highest information gain from the generated images. As shown in Fig 3,
we observed that well-reconstructed areas are typically represented by Gaussians with very small
volumes, calculated using the scaling vector s ∈R. Based on this observation, we propose a method
to calculate pixel-level confidence.

The unique representation of 3D Gaussians allows us to render an H×W×3 image using a process
similar to rendering colors, where each channel corresponds to one of the three components of the
scaling vector s. In 3DGS-Enhancer, we multiply these three channels of the scale map to obtain
pixel-level confidence. For each pixel in the generated images, higher confidence results in greater
weight in supervising the training of the 3DGS model.

Given a set of 3D Gaussian, the 3-channel Cconf confidence map is rendered as same as colour
rendering, and the formula is defined as follows

Cconf =

3DGS-Enhance Dataset

Given that the enhancement of 3DGS representations is a new task, we create a dataset to simulate
various artifacts of the 3DGS representations. This dataset also serves as a more comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance of few-shot NVS methods. Existing few-shot NVS
algorithms [44, 19] primarily focus on face-forward evaluations [25], where the test views have
significant overlap with the input views. However, this evaluation method is not suitable for large-
scale unbounded outdoor scenes. Therefore, we propose a dataset processing strategy that allows us
to post-process any existing multi-view dataset to generate a large number of training image pairs
that include typical artifacts caused by few-shot NVS.

More specifically, for each scene, we have n views Itrain = {I1, I2, . . . , In}, which serve as the
input for a high-quality 3DGS model. We uniformly sample a small number m of views Ilow
from Itrain, which serve as the input for the low-quality 3DGS model. By linearly fitting the high-
quality camera poses ptrain
i
= {ptrain
1
, ptrain

n∗}, we randomly sample a camera trajectory

} on ptrain

and render the image pairs using both high-quality and
low-quality 3DGS models. This creates a set of high-quality and low-quality image pairs used for the
training of our video diffusion model.

We apply this dataset processing strategy to DL3DV [21], a large-scale outdoor dataset containing
10K scenes. We randomly select 130 scenes from the original DL3DV dataset and form more than
150,000 image pairs. We randomly select another 20 scenes from DL3DV to form the test sets,
evaluating the corss-scene capability of our method. More implementation details of the method can
be found in the supplementary material.

5.2
Comparison with State-of-the-Arts

The quantitative and qualitative results on the DL3DV test set with 3 6 and 9 input views are shown in
Table 1 and Figure 4. Our approach outperforms all the other baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS
scores. NeRF-based methods including Mip-NeRF [1] and FreeNeRF [44] produce blurry novel
views due to smoothing inconsistencies. In contrast, 3DGS [18] generates elongated elliptical artifacts
due to local minima convergence. DNGuassian [19] reduces artifacts with depth regularization but
results in blurry and noisy novel views.

The first example in Figure 4 demonstrates 3DGS-Enhacer’s capability to remove artifacts while
preserving view consistency. By interpolating input views using a video diffusion model, we
incorporate more information while enrusing a high view consistency, enabling high-quality novel

recovering high-frequency details. Our dataset processing strategy and video diffusion model enable
an understand of strong multi-view prior across various scenes. As a result, very challenging cases
such as the trees can be restored with sharp details. In summary, comparisons with baseline methods
demonstrate our approach’s potential to significantly improve the unbounded 3DGS representations,
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views for open environments.

Ablation Study

Real image as reference views.
Table 3 shows the quantitative comparisons of different compo-
nents in 3DGS-Enhancer framework. The video diffusion model provides strong multi-view priors.
However, due to its native restrictions, we directly feed the original input views into the 3DGS
fine-tuning process. This results in more reliable and view-consistent information from the input
domain to facilitate 3DGS fine-tuning, as demonstrated by the "Real image" in Table 3.

Confidence aware reweighting.
Distant views are less likely to cause artifacts, so we normalize
their distance to reference views between [0, 1], giving higher confidence of video diffusion results to
farther viewpoints. This strategy is denoted by "Image confidence" in Table 3. Pixel-level confidence,
as denoted by "Pixel confidence" in Table 3, is based on the density of small-volume Gaussians
in well-reconstructed areas, using a color rendering pipeline to calculate volumes. Both pixel and
image-level confidence strategies improve results individually, and their combination yields the best
performance.

Video diffusion and STD.
Figure 6 visualizes the effects of video diffusion and STD module,
respectively. Video diffusion removes most of the artifacts, and STD module enhances fine-grained
and high-frequency textures, resulting in more vivid novel view renderings, which are closer to the
ground truth. Table 4 shows the improvment for each modules.

Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work

This paper has introduced 3DGS-Enhancer, a unified framework that applies view-consistency
prior from video diffusion and use trajectory interpolation method to enhance unbounded 3DGS
representations. By combining image and pixel-level confidence with 3DGS fine-tuning, we have
achieved state-of-the-art performance in NVS enhancement. However, our approach relies on adjacent
views for continuous interpolation, it cannot be easily adapted to single-view 3D model generation.
Moreover, the confidence-aware 3DGS fine-tuning strategies are relatively simple and straightforward.
In the future, it is interesting to integrate confidence maps directly with the video generation model,
enabling the generation of images that are more in line with the real 3D world without the need for
post-processing. Meanwhile, utilizing the efficient data generation capability of 3DGS to construct a
massively scaled dataset for our video generation model presents a prime opportunity to enhance the
model’s 3D consistency. This approach also facilitates the 2D models to understand the 3D world
directly from 2D images without additional geometric constraints. Regarding the social impact, the
goal of this work is to advance the fields of 3D reconstruction and NVS. There are many potential
societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

Details of 3DGS Enhancement Dataset

For our 3DGS Enhancement Dataset, constructed based on DL3DV, we randomly select 120 scenes
to create the training set for our video diffusion model and 30 scenes as the test set. By following
previous works, we use the standard train/test split, selecting every 8th frame of the remaining frames
for evaluation.

To create image pairs simulating the artifacts due to the lack of input views in novel view synthesis
problem, we render the image pairs from pairs of low-high quality 3DGS models. Specifically, the
input views for the high-quality model consist of all images in the original dataset, while the inputs
for the low-quality model are a subset uniformly sampled from the original dataset. To add more
complexity, we sample the subset according to a certain number (e.g., 3, 6, 9) or a certain ratio
(e.g., 5%). With the aim to fully capture the distribution of artifacts created by the sparse input
views and train the video diffusion model with smoother inputs, we propose a heuristic trajectory
fitting algorithm, as shown in Figure 7, proving a sequence of cameras by interpolating the low or
high-quality model’s input views. Specifically, if the original camera trajectories are smooth and
simple, such as those of DL3DV, we use the high-quality input views as the reference to fit the
trajectories. For complex trajectories, such as those in Mip-NeRF 360, we use the low-quality input
to avoid significantly poor rendering results, which would lead to unreasonable artifact distributions.
As a result, we render a large number of image pairs with and without artifacts, as shown in Figure 8,
at a resolution of 512 × 512, leading to powerful video diffusion priors with high view consistency
and photo-realism.

Training details

Our video diffusion model includes a pre-trained VAE to encode an image sequence into a latent
sequence and decode the latent sequence back into the image sequence. It also includes a U-Net with
learnable temporal layers, which employs cross-frame attention modules and 3D CNN modules to
ensure frame-consistent outputs. The input of video diffusion model is a image sequence segment
that includes 25 images with different sample steps from the image sequences rendered from the
low-quality 3DGS model. The first and the last frames in this segment are replaced with images
rendered from the high-quality 3DGS model. During fine-tuning, our video diffusion model is
conditioned on these image sequence segments and trained to synthesize the corresponding segments
rendered from the high-quality 3DGS model.

Our video diffusion model is fine-tuned with a learning rate of 0.0001, incorporating 500 steps for
warm-up, followed by a total of 80,000 training steps. The batch size is set to 1 in each GPU, where
each batch consisted of 25 images at 512x512 resolution. To optimize the training process, the
Adam optimizer is employed. Additionally, a dropout rate of 0.1 is applied to the conditions between
the first and last frames and the training process utilize CFG (classifier-free guidance) to train the
diffusion model. The training is conducted on 2 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs over 3 days. The STD
is fine-tuned with a learning rate of 0.0005 and 50,000 training steps. The batch size is set to 1 in
each GPU, where each batch consists of 5 images at 512x512 resolution, but for inference, it was
increased to 25. The fine-tuning process is conducted on 2 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs in 2 days. The
entire pipeline’s inference and training speeds were evaluated and are presented in Table 5.

Details of Comparison Baselines

For the evaluation datasets, we compare against the standard 3D Gaussian Splatting [18] (which is also
the reconstruction pipeline used in our work), and the state-of-the-art few-view NVS regularization
methods, including Mip-NeRF [1], FreeNeRF [44], Zip-NeRF [3], and RegNeRF [28]. We also
compare to some few-shot NVS methods using generative priors including ZeroNVS [33], and
ReconFusion [41].

For the evaluation of MipNeRF, FreeNeRF, RegNeRF, and DNGaussian on DL3DV and Mip-NeRF
360 dataset, we follow the original configurations and code shared by the authors. Additionally,
we use random point cloud as the initialization for 3DGS, following the implementations from
DNGaussian. We also decrease the batch size for RegNeRF from 4096 to 512 according to the limited
computation resource.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We ensured that the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The discussions on limitations of this work can be found in the last section of
the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed all implementation details of the proposed method in
Section 4 and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The project page has been online. The code and generated datasets will be
publicly available.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed all implementation details of the proposed method in
Section 4 and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Experiments on large-scale 3D reconstruction datasets are computationally
expensive. Existing literature also did not provide error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

19


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details of compute resources can be found in Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have ensured that this research followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the societal impacts in the last section of main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

20


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not have such risks for misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited the original papers that produced the code package and datasets.
The licenses for re-packaged datasets will be provided on the dataset website.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
