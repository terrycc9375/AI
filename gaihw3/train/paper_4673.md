Abstract

Transferring visual-language knowledge from large-scale foundation models for
video recognition has proved to be effective. To bridge the domain gap, additional
parametric modules are added to capture the temporal information. However,
zero-shot generalization diminishes with the increase in the number of specialized
parameters, making existing works a trade-off between zero-shot and close-set
performance. In this paper, we present MoTE, a novel framework that enables
generalization and specialization to be balanced in one unified model. Our approach
tunes a mixture of temporal experts to learn multiple task views with various
degrees of data fitting. To maximally preserve the knowledge of each expert, we
propose Weight Merging Regularization, which regularizes the merging process
of experts in weight space. Additionally with temporal feature modulation to
regularize the contribution of temporal feature during test. We achieve a sound
balance between zero-shot and close-set video recognition tasks and obtain state-
of-the-art or competitive results on various datasets, including Kinetics-400 & 600,
UCF, and HMDB. Code is available at https://github.com/ZMHH-H/MoTE.

Introduction

With the advent of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs), adapting such foundation models
(e.g., CLIP [33], ALIGN [13], Florence [54]) for downstream tasks has become an emerging paradigm
of intense scrutiny. Their semantic visual concepts empowered by aligning large-scale image-text pairs
can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as open-vocabulary classification [55,
56], detection [11, 51], and segmentation [21, 52].

The crux of an adaptation procedure for foundation models lies in injecting specialized knowledge
of the domain of interest. For video recognition tasks, this necessity is reflected in the fact that the
dynamic nature of video data requires effective comprehension of context and temporal correlation by
the model. Therefore, to condition the adapted model on the video-specialized knowledge, one general
and effective way is to incorporate additional parameters in the form of well-designed prompts [43,
45], adapters [30, 53], and temporal modules [28, 49, 50]. However, we observe that while the
increased model capacity brought by more additional parameters enables the better fitting of video-
specific inductive bias, it comes at the cost of catastrophically forgetting the generalization knowledge
of the original VLM. To better illustrate this phenomenon, we present an overview of existing methods
in Figure 1. A clear trade-off problem between zero-shot and close-set performance emerges in
existing works, which correlates to the scale of additional parameters. The former relies more on
the generalization capability inherent in VLMs while the latter requires intensive video-specialized
knowledge, but no method achieves the best of both worlds. On one hand, introducing new knowledge

while preserving existing knowledge continually is desirable and significant for the broader adaptation
of the foundation model. The rapidly evolving real-world applications also require both specialization
and generalization capabilities. However, how to manage the generalization/specialization trade-off
of additional parameters in transfer learning remains under-explored.

This paper addresses the aforementioned challenge by delving into two inquiries: (i) How can the
generalization capability of additional parameters be enhanced? Given the substantially smaller scale
of the fine-tuning dataset compared to the pre-training dataset of VLMs, the newly added parameters
risk overfitting the fine-tuning data bias, thereby constraining the model generalization. Addressing
this question enables steering parameters towards high generalization. Nevertheless, generalization
and specialization have proven to be somewhat conflicting [18, 29, 36] in model training, prompting
us to further explore (ii) How can generalization and specialization coexist in one unified model?
This question is crucial for a balanced model to preserve both new and existing knowledge, yet has
received limited exploration. We investigate these two questions with a widely employed temporal
module [14, 49, 50] (i.e. N-layer transformer), which already features a high specialization degree
but is less performant on zero-shot tasks.

With this in mind, we present MoTE, a mixture-of-temporal-experts approach with well-balanced
generalization and specialization. We offer a novel perspective in addressing the first question:
constructing a more generalized model using multiple data bias views. In contrast to conventional
temporal modules that encode patterns with a single feedforward network (FFN) in each Transformer
layer, MoTE uses multiple FFN experts to capture various data bias views. During fine-tuning,
incoming frame token sequences are routed to one of the temporal experts, keeping the computational
cost the same as using a single FFN. To enlarge the discrepancy in knowledge learned by each
expert, we devise a routing algorithm based on the multinomial distribution. During inference, we
apply weights merging to collapse multiple experts into one module, enabling the patched model to
aggregate the generalized knowledge of each expert. For the second question, we propose Weight
Merging Regularization which regularizes the merging process of experts in the weight space. The
proposed regularizer drives a range of the merged parameters optimal with respect to the task-specific
objective, allowing a more effective aggregation of generalized and specialized knowledge in the
patched model. To further alleviate the overfitting at test time, we devise a plug-and-play module that
modulates the contribution of temporal features by measuring the semantic association between the
proxy text features from the fine-tuning and the test datasets.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We propose MoTE, a knowledge transfer framework from visual-language to video domain. MoTE
tackles the fitting trade-off challenge posed by additional parameters, an aspect largely overlooked
by previous works.
• We provide new insights for enhancing parameter generalization from the perspective of data bias
fitting, all while keeping the computation cost and final structure constant (§ 3.1, § 3.2).
• We propose Weight Merging Regularization, a novel regularizer for more effective knowledge
aggregation, realizing the coexistence of generalization and specialization in weight space (§ 3.3).
Together with Temporal Feature Modulation to further improve the generalization of MoTE (§ 3.4).

Preliminary: Transferring CLIP for Video Recognition

Recent works have adapted CLIP [33] to video datasets and obtained superior results [28, 41]. We
briefly describe the typical cross-modal video recognition pipeline. Consider a video V with T frames
and the corresponding text label C described in a set of textual prompts. Each frame is encoded
independently by the CLIP visual encoder f(·|θv) with parameter θv and produces frame-level
embeddings {ei ∈RD}T
i=1. The text embedding y ∈RD is generated by the CLIP text encoder
g(·|θc) with parameter θc, where D is the embedding dimension,

e1, · · · , eT = f(V |θv), y = g(C|θc).
(1)

The CLIP visual encoder captures rich spatial information. To bridge the domain gap between image
and video, we apply a commonly used temporal module h(·|θtem) for cross-frame communication [14,
49, 50], which is parameterized by several Transformer layers. The final video embedding z ∈RD
consists of spatial and temporal embeddings connected in a residual form:

z = AvgPool([e1, · · · , eT ] + h(e1, · · · , eT |θtem)).
(2)

During optimization, the text encoder is typically frozen. We tune the visual encoder and the temporal
module to maximize the similarity sim(z, y) =
⟨z,y⟩
∥z∥∥y∥between the video embedding z and the
text embedding y if V and C are matched, otherwise minimize it. The training objective can be
formulated as:
L(θv, θtem; D) = E(V,C)∼D[I(sim(z, y), onehot(C))],
(3)

where D is the fine-tuning dataset, I is the cross-entropy function with softmax operation.

Methodology

An overview of our proposed method is presented in Figure 2. This section first analyzes the parameter
generalization from the perspective of data bias fitting (§ 3.1). Then we detail the structure, routing
policy, and inference of MoTE (§ 3.2). Finally, we present Weight Merging Regularization (§ 3.3) and
Temporal Feature Modulation (§ 3.4) towards the coexistence of generalization and specialization.

3.1
Intuition and Motivation

Typically, more additional parameters allow for better fitting of the training data distribution, leading
to better close-set performance. However, steering the model specialized on the target distribution
potentially makes it sensitive to out-of-distribution shifts, resulting in the generalization drop on
downstream data distributions with unseen video categories. Although one could enlarge the training
data distribution to cover as many potential unseen categories as possible, the costly computation and
collection of video data make this infeasible, indicating the need for a more generalized architecture.

Neural network optimization has many solutions in different loss basins due to the non-convexity of
the loss landscape. Models optimized with different configurations (e.g. initialization, optimizer, and
data) have different optimization trajectories and may converge to separate local minima, thereby
capturing various feature patterns. This inspires our method to construct a more generalized model
using multiple data bias views. Instead of improving generalization by searching for a flatter minimum
in the loss landscape [22, 48], we expect the aggregation of diverse knowledge from multiple minima
can provide a more comprehensive representation. Intuitively, diverse temporal patterns can better
facilitate recognizing an unseen video category. For example, aggregating information on ’player
movement’ and ’racket-ball interaction’ can help better recognize ’playing tennis’. Our architecture
design takes inspiration from Mixture-of-Experts [37] to learn multiple data bias views with a set of
experts. While MoE was originally proposed for building large pre-trained models, we extend it to the
context of transfer learning and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving parameter generalization.

each frame with the CLIP visual encoder. Then, the frame token sequences from a given batch are
routed to an activated expert for temporal pattern encoding. To regularize the merging process, we
sample the temperature τ from a discrete set and use it to collapse multi-experts into one merged FFN.
(Right): Temporal feature modulation. We modulate the contribution of the temporal feature with the
semantic association, which is measured by the similarity between the proxy text features retrieved
from the fine-tuning and the test categories. The modulated embedding is used for inference.

3.2
Mixture-of-Temporal-Experts

Architecture
Consider the temporal module h(·|θtem) as L repeated Transformer layers which
consist of a self-attention layer and a fully-connected feed-forward network (FFN). For clarity, the
temporal module’s parameter θtem is factorized into parameter θatt for attention layers and parameter
θf for FFNs, where θtem = θatt ∪θf. Recent studies [5, 9] suggest that factual knowledge is
mainly stored in the FFN, which consists of two learnable projection matrices and an activation
function. Thus, we replace the FFN in each Transformer layer with N temporal experts and obtain
a set of experts {{Ej
i }N
i=1}L
j=1, where Ej
i represents the ith expert at the jth layer and has the
same structure as the FFN. Each expert starts training from different random initialization to ensure
different optimization trajectories, which we experimentally show as critical for learning distinct
knowledge (i.e. data bias views). Denote the parameter of the expert Ej
i as θj
i and the activated
expert’s index at the jth layer as E(j). The training objective becomes:

LTE = L(θv, θatt, {θj
E(j)}L
j=1 ; D).
(4)

Routing Policy
The routing algorithm of MoE determines which experts process inputs. Classic
routing mechanisms (i.e. top-k gating [37]) make decisions using a learnable gate network and require
auxiliary losses to handle load balancing. Instead, we adopt the stochastic routing algorithm [59]
considering the architecture brevity, as it avoids the need for extra network, computation, and loss.

Recall that we expect each expert to learn distinct feature patterns. To further enlarge the discrepancy
in knowledge learned by each expert, we present a stochastic routing algorithm based on the multino-
mial distribution. By assigning different activation probabilities to experts, we can control the training
data volume of each expert, empowering their knowledge with different degrees of generalization and
specialization. Formally, set A = [αl
i]N
i=1 to be a random vector in the lth layer, where αl
i ∈{0, 1}
indicates whether the ith expert is activated and PN
i=1 αl
i = 1. We specify the variable A to follow
the multinomial distribution where the activation probability of each expert is given as

P(αl
i = 1) =
exp(i)
PN
i=1 exp(i)
,
(5)

where exp(·) is the natural exponential function. This allows experts with a greater index to be
activated more likely and therefore receive a larger volume of data during training. Once the expert is
selected, all inputs in a given batch are processed by the same expert.

Knowledge Aggregation in Inference
During inference, knowledge across experts can be ag-
gregated by either merging weights [44, 47] or ensembling logits [16]. We adopt merging weights
with the following benefits: (i) More effective knowledge aggregation as evidenced in Table 2. (ii)
Constant computation cost, while the latter increases linearly with the expert number. (iii) Consistent
parameter structure with its initial state. Specifically, for the experts {El
i}N
i=1 in the lth layer, we
average the weights of all the experts to obtain the final parameters ˜θl for inference, where

3.3
Weight Merging Regularization

While the introduction of MoTE notably improves model generalization, it still incurs a decrease
in close-set performance as presented in Table 1, which again proves the conflicting nature of
generalization and specialization in weight space. We attribute this phenomenon to the difficulty of
simultaneously preserving the generalized and specialized knowledge during expert merging process.

In this regard, we propose Weight Merging Regularization to reconcile and promote the aggregation
efficacy of expert knowledge. To maximally aggregate the specialized knowledge of experts, the
final merged model necessitates explicit optimization with respect to the task-specific objective. As
for the preservation of the generalization knowledge, previous works [17, 22, 27] observe that the
flatness (i.e. sharpness) of local minima in the loss landscape is strongly correlated with the model
generalization. They suggest that models with flatter local minima in the loss landscape generalize
better on unseen data, where the flatness refers to the robustness of the loss value to perturbations in
the parameters. Within a flat basin of the loss landscape, moderate variations of parameters do not
lead to significant increases in loss. Inspired by this observation, we propose to facilitate preserving
the generalized knowledge of experts by explicitly constructing a flat region around the loss landscape
of the final merged model. We optimize the constructed region with the task-specific loss objective
and demonstrate that region construction benefits the coexistence of specialization and generalization
in one unified model. Formally, for the experts {El
i}N
i=1 in the lth layer, we first merge the weights as

ϕl ←

N

exp(i/τ)
PN

· θl

(7)

where τ is a temperature parameter used to control the softness of the distribution. By varying the
value of τ, we can build a region of the merged parameters in the weight space. Considering that
sampling τ in a continuous space may lead to difficulties in model convergence, we sample τ from a
discrete set given as {±2n · β}4
n=0 ∪{∞}, where β is a hyper-parameter of the candidate set. With
parameters {ϕj}L
j=1 merged using different τ in each layer, the regularizer is defined as:

LWMR = L(θv, θatt, {ϕj}L
j=1 ; D).
(8)

Denote the generated video feature when computing LWMR as zr. We further slightly regularize the
consistency between zr and the pooled spatial feature e from the CLIP visual encoder:

LMSE = E(V,C)∼D[∥zr −e∥2
2],
(9)

where ∥·∥2 is the L2 norm. This regularizer encourages MoTE to model the temporal dynamics with
a light temporal feature, which potentially reduces the model complexity and improves generalization.
The overall learning objective can be written as:

LALL = LTE + λLWMR + ηLMSE,
(10)

where we set λ = 0.5 and η = 0.1 by default.

3.4
Temporal Feature Modulation

While applying MoTE to downstream recognition tasks, a potential risk is that its semantic space is
limited to the category names of the fine-tuning dataset. To demonstrate this, we collect the category
names of Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and Kinetics-600 datasets and manually remove duplicate ones. We

5


---Page Break---
conduct tests with the mixed category names and observe 2.9% closed-set performance drops, 29.8%
and 31.1% zero-shot performance drops on Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and Kinetics-600, respectively.
That is, the model tends to classify all videos into fine-tuning categories.

In light of this, we propose a test-time adaptation strategy for networks where the temporal module
is separated from the CLIP encoder, to measure the confidence of temporal features by means of
CLIP’s text space and modulates the contribution of temporal features to the prediction. Given the
pooled feature e from the CLIP visual encoder, we generate fine-tuning and test proxy features
yf, yt ∈RK×D by retrieving the K nearest text features in the fine-tuning and the test dataset
categories. We estimate the semantic association ρ between the two proxy features as

ρ = exp(−(1 −M(ytyT
f ))/γ),
(11)

where γ stands for a scale hyper-parameter and M(·) is a sequential maximum and average pooling
operation. Denote the pooled temporal feature from MoTE as t, the final video embedding z used for
inference becomes z = e + ρ · t.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental Setup

Architecture.
We employ the CLIP [33] pre-trained ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14 in our experiments.
On top of the visual encoder, we add 6 layers MoTE for ViT-L/14 and 4 layers MoTE for ViT-B/16,
with 4 temporal experts per layer by default.

Implementation Details.
We fine-tune our model using the Kinetics-400 [15] dataset as in previous
works [28]. During fine-tuning, we sparsely sample T (e.g. 8 or 16) frames as the video input. Each
input example is randomly cropped and resized to the size of 224 × 224 and then undergoes random
horizontal flip and random grayscale. We adopt AdamW [25] as the optimizer with a weight decay of
0.2, following a half-period cosine learning rate decay. The initial learning rate is set to 5 × 10−5
with a total batch size of 144. Furthermore, we set the candidate set β for LWMR to 0.6 and the
scale parameter γ for temporal feature modulation to 0.05, and K to 5. We apply temporal feature
modulation only in evaluation. Please see supplementary for more details.

Evaluation Protocols.
We thoroughly evaluate our method with close-set, zero-shot, and few-shot
video recognition. Close-set: We evaluate the close-set performance on Kinetics-400 [15], using one
single clip with a center crop (i.e. 1×1 views) or 4 clips with 3 crops (i.e. 4×3 views) per video [28].
Each view contains 8 or 16 sparsely sampled frames. Zero-shot: Following previous works [28, 34],
we evaluate zero-shot performance on UCF-101 [38], HMDB-51 [19], and Kinetics-600 [3]. For
K600, we adopt the three splits provided by [4]. Each split contains 160 categories out of 220 new
categories. In zero-shot setting, we test using 3 × 1 views with 8 frames per view. Few-shot: We
consider standard K-shot setting and evaluate on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Something-Something
v2 [10]. We adopt a single view for evaluation.

4.2
Ablation Studies

Component-wise analysis of MoTE.
In Table 1, we perform in-depth ablations of the proposed
components with the ViT-L/14 network. We adopt Text4Vis [49] as our baseline, which serves as a
prevalent CLIP adaptation framework in the video domain. Text4Vis uses a 6-layer Transformer for
temporal modeling, featuring a high degree of specialization but low generalization capability. We
observe that adopting the temporal experts boosts zero-shot performance significantly, validating our
idea of improving generalization with multiple data bias views. We then introduce LWMR for achiev-
ing the coexistence of generalization and specialization, which facilitates a more efficient aggregation
of generalized knowledge while achieving the same level of specialization as Text4Vis. Adding
LMSE further improves the zero-shot performance. Moreover, we find that zero-shot performance
benefits from modulating the temporal features for unseen categories during evaluation, especially for
HMDB51. In summary, MoTE achieves a sound balance between generalization and specialization.

Expert-wise performance of MoTE.

we show the performance of each expert and the final merged model in Figure 3. In particular,

CLIP-Mean denotes a fine-tuned CLIP model with mean pooling for temporal modeling. We do not
apply temporal feature modulation in this study. As shown in the figure, each expert exhibits distinct
zero-shot and close-set performances, suggesting that diverse knowledge is learned across experts, as
expected in Section 3.2. We find that the zero-shot performance of each dataset presents different
sweet spots in terms of the generalization degree. For example, Expert_1 achieves the best results
on UCF-101, while Expert_0 performs best on HMDB-51. After weight merging using Equation 6,
the merged model yields better zero-shot results than any expert and CLIP-Mean, and the close-set
performance slightly outperforms Text4Vis. It demonstrates that our method effectively preserves the
generalized and specialized knowledge of every expert, which can be attributed to LWMR.

Effect of distinct optimization trajectories.
In Table 2a, we show that learning diverse knowledge
from distinct optimization trajectories is critical for improving generalization. "Data" indicates
whether the input data is sent to all experts or routed to one expert for encoding. In the first row, the
optimization trajectories across experts are identical since all experts share the same initialization
and input data. We find that applying different initialization and training data across experts can
significantly improve generalization, respectively. When comparing row 3 with row 4, using the
routing strategy achieves similar generalization performance while keeping the computation cost low.

Varying numbers of experts and temporal layers
We ablate the number of experts in Table 2b.
We observe that the zero-shot performance gains stabilize after a proper number of experts, and 4
temporal experts per layer are sufficient to capture various data bias views. As for the number of
temporal layers, we obtain consistent gains with different numbers of layers as shown in Figure 1 (b),
demonstrating the scalability of our method.

Various types of knowledge aggregation.
As shown in Table 2c, the inferior performance of
random routing indicates the necessity of leveraging diverse knowledge across experts. Compared
with ensembling logits, merging weights aggregate knowledge more efficiently with fewer parameters.
Meanwhile, the computation cost of ensembling logits is 4 × merging weights.

Effect of different routing policies.
Table 2d ablates different routing policies. The fixed rout-
ing policy sends all inputs to a single expert. Our multinomial routing policy achieves the best
performance since each expert learns more discrepant knowledge than random routing.

Weight Merging Regularization. We study different types of the merging regularizer LWMR as well
as candidate set parameters β in Table 2e. "Point" indicates the regularizer with the average merged

parameters (i.e. without region construction). Due to the conflicting nature of generalization and
specialization in optimization, the regularizer without region construction cannot adequately aggregate
expert knowledge. Instead, constructing the region in the loss landscape enables generalization and
specialization to coexist in one model. The parameter β is used to construct the candidate set of the
weights merging temperature. As shown in the table, the performance gain is robust to this parameter.

Varying numbers of γ for Temporal Feature Modulation. The parameter γ is used to scale the
semantic association to an appropriate interval. In general, γ = 0.05 yields better results. We find that
different datasets exhibit varying sensitivities to this parameter and a relatively small contribution of
temporal features generalizes to the unseen categories. Please see supplementary for more ablations.

Main Results

Zero-shot video recognition.
In Table 3, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art results
under the zero-shot setting. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on UCF-101 and HMDB-
51, with only 8 frames as input. The remarkable performance can be scaled up as the network size
and the input frame number increase, demonstrating the great scalability of our method. For K600,
although significant improvements are achieved over the baseline, our method still underperforms
some methods that do not apply any additional parameters such as Open-VCLIP [46] and MAXI [23].
Since the categories of Kinetics-600 are much more complex, we argue that it is still challenging
for randomly initialized parameters to generalize well on such complex unseen categories. Note that
our method still outperforms any method that employs additional parameters on K600. Overall, our
method presents superior generalization performance.

Close-set and zero-shot performance trade-off.
Table 4 presents comparisons with the state-of-
the-art methods under the close-set setting. We also list the harmonic mean of the zero-shot results
on UCF, HMDB, and K600 as an indicator of the generalization capability, denoted as HMZS. To
evaluate the holistic performance in close-set and zero-shot settings, we define the "Trade-off" score
as the harmonic mean of Top-1K400 and HMZS, as we consider the specialization and generalization
capabilities to be equally important for a balanced model.

As shown in the table, our method presents strong close-set results competitive with SOTAs and
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. More importantly, while existing methods can perform well
on only one task setting, we achieve superior performance on both settings simultaneously with
one unified model. Our method consistently exhibits significant trade-off performance advantages
across different networks, evidencing the effectiveness and scalability of MoTE in reconciling
generalization and specialization capabilities. Even against ViFi-CLIP [34] which uses different
training hyperparameters for close-set and zero-shot settings and takes more frames as the input, our
method still shows better balanced performance (74.7% vs. 72.9%). Noteworthy that FROSTER [12]
is a strong zero-shot action recognition model but performs less well in the close-set setting, which

can be attributed to the the application of the weights ensemble and the distillation supervision from
the Frozen CLIP limits the model’s ability to learn video-specialized knowledge.

Few-shot video recognition.
We perform all-way few-shot video recognition in Table 5, which
requires both specialization and generalization to rapidly adapt to a novel set of categories with limited
samples. Our method presents consistent improvements across sample shots in all datasets, demon-
strating the strong learning capacity and transferability. Our method even outperforms MAXI [23]
which uses K400 fine-tuning weights as initialization and more diverse textual knowledge.

Category-wise performance visualization.

To better understand the specific video categories that each expert excels at recognizing, we visualize
the Top-1 classification accuracy for categories sampled from the UCF-101 dataset in Figure 4. The
experiment is conducted in the zero-shot setting. We observe that different experts show distinct
performance across video categories, likely due to the diverse generalization knowledge learned by
each expert. The merged expert benefits from the aggregation of expert knowledge, particularly for
categories where temporal information is crucial, such as ’Handstand Pushups’ and ’Wall Pushups’.
This suggests that each expert can capture various temporal patterns within the same category.

Related Work

Video recognition.
In the era of deep learning, early works explored diverse variants of convolu-
tional networks for joint spatiotemporal modeling, such as 3D convolution [2, 39] and factorized
spatial and temporal convolution [40]. The advent of Transformer then attracted the attention of
researchers and has been widely applied for video recognition [1, 6]. In addition, self-supervised
learning methods learn transferable representations from large-scale unlabeled data and achieve
promising performances [7, 31, 57].

Transferring VLMs for videos.
Transferring VLMs for video recognition task has been proven
to be effective. ViFi-CLIP [34] suggests that a direct fine-tuning process generalizes well on
various settings. Open-VCLIP [46] constructs an open-vocabulary video model by interpolating the
model weights and its optimization trajectory. Vita-CLIP [45] extracts discriminative information
using multi-level prompts. X-CLIP [28] proposes cross-frame attention and multi-frame integration
modules for temporal modeling. Text4Vis [49] and BIKE [50] explore the way for more effective
knowledge transfer and use multi-transformer layers to capture temporal cues. FROSTER [12]
mitigates catastrophic forgetting by ensuring the learned features do not diverge too far from the
frozen ones through distillation. This divergence comes from the variations of both CLIP and
additional trainable parameters. Differently, we believe the main cause of the forgetting problem is
the overfitting of additional parameters regardless of whether the CLIP parameters are tuned. Note
that FROSTER can also potentially improve the generalization of additional parameters through
knowledge distillation, but our method presents a more explicit way to achieve this goal. Existing
methods face a trade-off of introducing more specialized knowledge or preserving more generalized
knowledge. Our work addresses this challenge and presents superior results on both close-set and
zero-shot settings.

Mixture-of-Experts.
The sparsely activated MoE structure [37] enables the model capacity (i.e.
number of parameters) to be vastly scaled up while keeping the computation cost per sample basically
unchanged. This technique has been widely investigated in building large-scale pre-trained models in
various fields [20, 26, 35]. Several works employ MoE on large-scale language models for parameter-
efficient tuning to improve their specialized performance [8, 44]. In this paper, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in balancing generalization and specialization in VLM knowledge transfer.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present MoTE, an effective Visual-Language to video knowledge transfer framework
that enjoys both superior generalization and specialization. MoTE leverages a mixture of temporal ex-
perts to enhance performance in both close-set and zero-shot video recognition, all while maintaining
the conventional temporal module’s structure and computational efficiency. With the proposed weight
merging regularization and temporal feature modulation, we achieve the coexistence of generalization
and specialization in one unified model. Extensive experiments validate MoTE’s ability to strike an
optimal trade-off between close-set and zero-shot performance.

Supplemental material

A
Limitation and Broader Impact

Limitation and future work
While our method yields superior results in various settings of
video recognition, there are still several aspects for improvement. First, the text space of MoTE is
limited to video category names, which do not provide discriminative and semantically rich textual
representations. Thus, exploring how to extend the semantic space with large-scale generative models
may further enhance the performance of MoTE. Besides, additional parameters take various forms
when adapting VLM to downstream tasks. In future work, we will further extend our approach to
other forms of parameters to explore the generality and versatility of our method.

Broader Impact
Adapting foundation models to downstream tasks has become a dominant
paradigm in machine learning [24, 30], we believe that it is worthwhile and important to explore
how to preserve the existing knowledge of the foundation model when introducing new knowledge.
We hope this work brings new insights for the broader and long-term adaptation of foundation
models. Besides, our work focuses on video recognition tasks, which have a wide range of real-world
application scenarios, such as surveillance. However, this work requires careful elimination of privacy
and rights concerns before real-world deployments.

More Implementation Details

Close-set and zero-shot video recognition.
In Table 6, we present the hyper-parameters set for
optimization. Note that we train one model for both close-set and zero-shot tasks, rather than training
for each task separately. The parameters of all projection matrices in MoTE are initialized with values
drawn from the normal distribution (mean=0, std=0.02). All bias terms are initialized as zero. We
conduct experiments with 3 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090.

For zero-shot evaluation, the methods are evaluated on three official splits of UCF-101 and HMDB-51.
For Kinetics-600, we adopt the three splits provided by [4]. Each split contains 160 categories out of
220 new categories that do not exist in K400. We report the average Top-1 accuracy and the standard
deviation on three splits.

Few-shot video recognition.
We consider the standard K-shot setting [28, 34], where 2, 4, 8, and
16 video data are randomly sampled for each category for constructing the training dataset. Following
previous work [49], we repeat the constructed training dataset to maintain the same size as the

Additional Ablations

Optional architecture of temporal expert.
By default, we replace the whole FFN with experts of
the same structure as the FFN. Optionally, we can replace one or both of the projection matrices in the
FFN with experts of the same structure, as illustrated in Figure 5. We study the optional architecture
design of the temporal expert in Table 7a. As shown in the table, we observe degraded performance
with projection-level expert designs. We argue that the shared projection matrix or two-stage routing
design of the projection-level expert allows knowledge communication between experts, such implicit
communication may lead to mutual fitting between the experts. Therefore, preventing the knowledge
exchange across experts is critical for learning diverse generalized knowledge.

Varying neighbor numbers K for Temporal Feature Modulation.
In Section 3.4 of the main
manuscript, we generate fine-tuning proxy features yf and test proxy features yt by retrieving the
K nearest text features in the fine-tuning and the test dataset categories. We study the influence
of various K in Table 7b. We find that a large K leads to a slight performance degradation as the
retrieved text features may not represent the semantic information of the video properly. Overall, our
performance gains are stable for this parameter.

Various Loss Types of Weight Merging Regularization.
In Section 3.3 of the main manuscript,
we design the weight merging regularization LWMR based on the cross-entropy loss function. In
this study, we use other loss function types to redesign the weight merging regularization LWMR.
Note that our training procedure requires two forward passes of the temporal module, one when

optimizing the activated expert with LTE and the second in calculating weight merging regularization
LWMR. When we optimize LWMR using cross entropy, we use the ground truth label of the video as
the supervised signal. We try to redesign LWMR with other supervisions. (i) KL Divergence: We
adopt the logits generated during the computation of LTE as the supervision and optimize with KL
divergence loss, denoted as LWMR_KL. (ii) Mean Square Error: We use the output feature when
computing LTE as the supervision and optimizing with MSE loss, denoted as LWMR_MSE. The
results are presented in Table 7c. Interestingly, we find that the MSE loss achieves notable results in a
weakly supervised manner, which indicates the potential scalability of our proposed approach.

Training cost analysis of MoTE.
We report the actual training time of our method with respect to
the baseline in Table 7d. The wall-clock time of training is benchmarked on 3 4090 GPUs with a
batch size of 144. GPU days are calculated by the number of GPUs multiplied by the training time in
days. As shown in the table, applying the mixture of temporal experts does not introduce additional
training overhead over baseline, which can be attributed to the use of the routing strategy. Adding
LWMR and LMSE brings a +0.16 days training time increase since it requires an additional forward
pass of the temporal module.

Transferring CLIP with small-scale fine-tuning data.
In the main text, our experimental setting
follows previous works in fine-tuning on large-scale K400 and then evaluating zero-shot performance
on relatively small downstream datasets. To further investigate MoTE’s capabilities when the fine-
tuning data are limited, we train the ViT-L/14 network on UCF-101 and evaluate it on K400, results
are shown in Table 7e. MoTE yields a 0.5 improvement over the Baseline on UCF-101, while zero-
shot performance on K400 significantly outperforms both raw CLIP and Baseline. This demonstrates
the applicability of MoTE to small-scale datasets and its ability to learn generalized knowledge from
limited data.

Effect of temperature selection schemes.
In this study, we compare our discrete temperature
sampling strategy with the continuous space selection schemes. We implement two continuous
space selection schemes. (1) Sampling from a continuous standard normal distribution (mean=0,
variance=1). (2) Sampling from a continuous uniform distribution. As shown in Table 7f, the
continuous space sampling strategy results in a notable performance degradation.

D
Textual Prompt Templates

In our work, we adopt a set of hand-craft textual prompt templates to generate text embeddings.
Following CLIP [33], we perform prompt ensembling over the 28 templates in order to provide
comprehensive semantics. The templates are listed in Table 8.

Qualitative Analysis

E.1
Model Attention

To better understand what knowledge the experts capture, we present the visualization of the model
attention in Figure 6. We show the attention map of the merged expert, expert_0, and expert_4 to
explore whether diverse knowledge is learned across experts. Since MoTE only requires the input
of frame-level tokens from the CLIP visual encoder, we calculate the attention map between the
temporal video features output by MoTE and the image patch tokens from the CLIP encoder. As
shown in the figure, experts_0 and experts_4 always focus on different regions, indicating that they
capture various temporal patterns. Besides, we observe that the merged expert is able to focus on more
precise and broader foreground areas. This phenomenon suggests that the merged expert sufficiently
aggregates and leverages the knowledge from different experts.

E.2
Representation similarity across experts.

We visualize the representation similarities across each expert and the final merged model in Figure
7. The representation similarities are averaged on 100 randomly sampled data of unseen categories
from the K600 dataset. As show in the affinity map, the different similarities demonstrate that each
expert learns distinctive knowledge from different optimization trajectories. Besides, we observe that
the similarities between the merged model and each expert are relatively stable, indicating that the
merged expert efficiently leverages the knowledge contained in each expert.
