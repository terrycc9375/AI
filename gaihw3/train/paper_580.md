Abstract

Low-bit quantization has become widespread for compressing image super-
resolution (SR) models for edge deployment, which allows advanced SR models
to enjoy compact low-bit parameters and efficient integer/bitwise constructions
for storage compression and inference acceleration, respectively. However, it is
notorious that low-bit quantization degrades the accuracy of SR models compared
to their full-precision (FP) counterparts. Despite several efforts to alleviate the
degradation, the transformer-based SR model still suffers severe degradation due
to its distinctive activation distribution. In this work, we present a dual-stage low-
bit post-training quantization (PTQ) method for image super-resolution, namely
2DQuant, which achieves efficient and accurate SR under low-bit quantization.
The proposed method first investigates the weight and activation and finds that
the distribution is characterized by coexisting symmetry and asymmetry, long
tails. Specifically, we propose Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI),
using different searching strategies to search a coarse bound for quantizers. To
obtain refined quantizer parameters, we further propose Distillation Quantization
Calibration (DQC), which employs a distillation approach to make the quantized
model learn from its FP counterpart. Through extensive experiments on different
bits and scaling factors, the performance of DOBI can reach the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) while after stage two, our method surpasses existing PTQ in both met-
rics and visual effects. 2DQuant gains an increase in PSNR as high as 4.52dB
on Set5 (×2) compared with SOTA when quantized to 2-bit and enjoys a 3.60×
compression ratio and 5.08× speedup ratio. The code and models are available at

Introduction

As one of the most classical low-level computer vision tasks, image super-resolution (SR) has
been widely studied with the significant development of deep neural networks. With the abil-
ity to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) image from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) image,
SR has been widely used in many real-world scenarios, including medical imaging [13, 21, 19],
surveillance [46, 39], remote sensing [1], and mobile phone photography. With massive parameters,
DNN-based SR models always require expensive storage and computation in the actual application.
Some works have been proposed to reduce the demand for computational power of SE models, like
lightweight architecture design and compression. One kind of approach investigates lightweight
and efficient models as the backbone for image SR. This progression has moved from the earliest
convolutional neural network (CNNs) [10, 11, 25, 49] to Transformers [48, 32, 44, 42, 4, 3] and their
combinations. The parameter number significantly decreased while maintaining or even enhancing
performance. The other kind of approach is compression, which focuses on reducing the parameter
(e.g., pruning and distillation) or bit-width (quantization) of existing SR models.

Model quantization [7, 9, 20, 31] is a technology that compresses the floating-point parameters of
a neural network into lower bit-width. The discretized parameters are homogenized into restricted

candidate values and cause heterogenization between the FP and quantized models, leading to
severe performance degradation. Considering the process, quantization approaches can be divided
into quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ). QAT simultaneously
optimizes the model parameters and the quantizer parameters [6, 16, 26, 50], allowing them to adapt
mutually, thereby more effectively alleviating the degradation caused by quantization. However, QAT
often suffers from a heavy training cost and a long training time, and the burden is even much heavier
than the training process of the FP counterparts, which necessitates a large amount of compatibility
and makes it still far from practical in training-resource-limited scenarios.

Fortunately,
post-training quantization
emerges as a promising way to quantize
models at a low training cost. PTQ fixes
the model parameters and only determines
the quantizer parameters through search or
optimization. Previous researches [41, 26]
on PTQ for SR has primarily focused on
CNN-based models such as EDSR [33] and SRResNet [24]. However, these quantization methods are
not practical for deployment for two reasons. Firstly, these CNN-based models themself require huge
space and calculation resources. Their poor starting point makes them inferior to advanced models in
terms of parameters and computational cost, even after quantization. As shown in Table 1, the light
version of SwinIR needs only 16.2% parameters and 15.9% FLOPs compared with quantized EDSR.
But its PSNR metric is close to that of the FP EDSR. While the previous PTQ algorithm, DBDC+Pac,
suffers from unacceptable degradation in both visual and metrics. Secondly, most of these methods
can not adapt well to Transformer-based models because of the deterioration of self-attention in
quantized transformers. As shown in Figure 1, when applied on SwinIR, the existing methods still
suffer from distorted artifacts compared with FP or HR.

Therefore, we conducted a post-training
quantization analysis on super-resolution
with a classical Transformer-based model
SwinIR [32]. The weight and activation
distribution is characterized by coexisting symmetry and asymmetry, long tails. Firstly, if the
previous symmetric quantization method is applied for asymmetric distribution, at least half of
the candidates are completely ineffective. Besides, the long tail effect causes the vast majority of
floating-point numbers to be compressed into one or two candidates, leading to worse parameter
homogenization. Furthermore, with such a small number of parameters, SwinIR’s information
has been highly compressed, and quantizing the model often results in significant performance
degradation. Nevertheless, the excellent performance and extremely low computational requirements
of Transformer-based models are precisely what is needed for deployment in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose 2DQuant, a two-stage PTQ algorithm for image super-resolution tasks. To
enhance the representational capacity in asymmetry scenarios, we employ a quantization method with
two bounds. The bounds decide the candidate for numbers out of range and the interval of candidates
in range. First, we propose distribution-oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI), a fast MSE-based
searching method. It is designed to minimize the value heterogenization between quantized and
FP models. Two different MSE [5] search strategies are applied for different distributions to avoid
nonsense traversal. This guarantees minimum value shift while maintaining high speed and efficiency
in the search process. Second, we propose Distillation Quantization Calibration (DQC), a training-
based method. It is designed to adjust each bound to its best position finely. This ensures that the
outputs and intermediate feature layers of the quantized model and that of the FP model should
remain as consistent as possible. Thereby DQC allows the quantizer parameters to be finely optimized
toward the task goal. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

(1) To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore PTQ with Transformer-based model in
SR thoroughly. We design 2DQuant, a unique and efficient two-stage PTQ method (see Figure 2) for
image super-resolution, which utilizes DOBI and DQC to optimize the bound from coarse to fine.

(2) In the first stage of post-quantization, we use DOBI to search for quantizer parameters, employing
customized search strategies for different distributions to balance speed and accuracy. In the second
stage, we design DQC, a more fine-grained optimization-based training strategy, for the quantized
model, ensuring it aligns with the FP model on the calibration set.

Figure 2: The overall pipeline of our proposed 2DQuant method. The whole pipeline contains two
stages, optimizing the clipping bound from coarse to fine. In stage 1, we design DOBI to efficiently
obtain the coarse bound. In stage 2, DQC is performed to finetune clipping bounds and guarantee the
quantized model learns the full-precision (FP) model’s feature and output information.

(3) Our 2DQuant can compress Transformer-based model to 4,3,2 bits with the compression ratio
being 3.07×, 3.31×, and 3.60× and speedup ratio being 3.99×, 4.47×, and 5.08×. No additional
module is added so 2DQuant enjoys the theoretical upper limit of compression and speedup.

(4) Through extensive experiments, our 2DQuant surpasses existing SOTA on all benchmarks. We
gain an increase in PSNR by as high as 4.52dB in Set5 (×2) when compressed to 2 bits, and our
method has a more significant increase when compressed to lower bits.

Image super-resolution.
Deep CNN networks have shown excellent performance in the field of
image super-resolution. The earliest SR-CNN [10, 11] method adopted a CNN architecture. It
surpassed previous methods in the image super-resolution domain. In 2017, EDSR [33] won the
NTIRE2017 [40] championship, becoming a representative work of CNNs in the SR by its excellent
performance. Thereafter, with the continuous development of Vision Transformers (ViT) [12],
models based on the ViT architecture have surpassed many CNN networks. These Transformer-
based models achieve significant performance improvements and they have fewer parameters and
lower computational costs. Many works have modified the ViT architecture, achieving continuous
improvements. A notable example is SwinIR [32]. With a simple structure, it outperforms many CNN-
based models. However, previous explorations of post-quantization in the super-resolution domain
have been limited to CNN-based models. They focus on models like EDSR [33] or SRResNet [24].
It is a far cry from advanced models no matter in parameters, FLOPs, or performance. Currently,
there is still a research gap in post-quantization for Transformer architectures.

Model quantization.
Model quantization is used to compress large models [30, 28, 29] and can be
divided into QAT and PTQ. QAT is widely accepted due to its minimal performance degradation.
PAMS [26] utilizes a trainable truncated parameter to dynamically determine the upper limit of
the quantization range. DAQ [17] proposed a channel-wise distribution-aware quantization scheme.
CADyQ [16] is designed for SR networks and optimizes the bit allocation for local regions and
layers in the input image. However, QAT usually requires training for as long as or even longer than
the original model, which becomes a barrier for real scenarios deployment. Instead of training the
model from scratch, existing PTQ methods use the pre-trained models. PTQ algorithms only find
the clipping bound for quantizers, saving time and costs. DBDC+Pac [41] is the first to optimize
the post-training quantization for image super-resolution task. It outperforms other existing PTQ
algorithms. Whereas, they only focus on EDSR [33] and SRResNet [24]. Their 4-bit quantized
version is inferior to advanced models in terms of parameters and computational cost, let alone
performance. It reveals a promising result for PTQ on SR, and using a more advanced model could
bridge the gap between high-performance models and limited calculation resource scenarios.

Methodology
To simulate the precision loss caused by quantization, we use fake-quantize [22],i.e.quantization-
dequantization, for activations and weights. and the process can be written as

vr = Round(2N −1

Figure 3 shows the basic structure of the Transformer block. We
have quantized all the modules with a significant computational
load within them, effectively reducing the model’s FLOPs. Table 2
shows the FLOPs needed for each module. The Linear layers and
matrix multiplication account for approximately 86% of the compu-
tation load, which are all transformed into integer arithmetic. When
performing gradient backpropagation, we follow the Straight-Through Estimator [8] (STE) style:

where ∂vc

∂u = H(u −v) and vc

∂l = H(l −v), H(·) denotes Heaviside step function [47]. This formula
approximates the direction of gradient backpropagation, allowing training-based optimization to
proceed. The derivation of the formula can be found in the supplementary material.

Figure 2 shows the whole pipeline of 2DQuant, which is a two-stage coarse-to-fine post-training
quantization method. The first stage is DOBI, using two strategies to minimize the value shift while
the second stage is DQC, optimizing two bound of each quantizer towards the task goal.

3.1
Analysis of data distribution
To achieve better quantization results, we need to analyze the distribution of the model’s weights and
activations in detail. We notice that the data distribution shows a significantly different pattern from
previous explorations, invalidating many of the previous methods. The weights and activations distri-
bution of SwinIR is shown in Figure 4. More can be found in supplemental material. Specifically, the
weights and activations of SwinIR exhibit noticeable long-tail, coexisting symmetry and asymmetry.

Weight.
The weights of all linear layers are symmetrically distributed around zero, showing clear
symmetry, and are generally similar to a normal distribution. This is attributed to the weight
decay applied to weights, which provides quantization-friendly distributions. From the value shift
perspective, both symmetric and asymmetric quantization are tolerable. Whereas, from the vantage
point of task objectives, asymmetric quantization possesses the potential to offer a markedly enhanced
information density, thus elevating the overall precision of the computational processes involved.

Activations.
As for activations, they exhibit obvious periodicity in different Transformer Blocks.
For V or the input of FC1, the obtained activation values are symmetrically distributed around
0. However, for the attention map or the input of FC2 in each Transformer Block, due to the
Softmax calculation or the GELU [14] activation function, the minimum value is almost fixed, and
the overall distribution is similar to an exponential distribution. Therefore, the data in SwinIR’s
weights and activations exhibit two distinctly different distribution characteristics. Setting asymmetric
quantization and different search strategies for both can make the search rapid and accurate.

3.2
Distribution-oriented bound initialization

Because the data distribution exhibits a significant long-tail effect, we must first clip the range to avoid
low effective bits. Common clipping methods include density-based, ratio-based, and MSE-based
approaches. The first two require manually specifying the clipping ratio, which significantly affects
the clipping outcome and necessitates numerous experiments to determine the optimal ratio. Thus we
proposed the Distribution-Oriented Bound Initialization (DOBI) to search the bound for weight and

(3)

The collection of all quantizers’ bounds {(li, ui)}N
i=1 is the linchpin of quantized model performance
as it indicates the candidate value for weights and activations. We note that the data distribution falls
into two categories: one resembling a bell-shaped distribution and the other resembling an exponential
distribution. For the bell-shaped distribution, we use a symmetric boundary-narrowing search method.
Whereas, for the exponential distribution, we fix the lower bound to the minimum value of the data
and only traverse the right bound. The specific search method is shown in Algorithm 1. The time
complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(MK), where M is the number of elements in data v and K is the
number of search points. The condition v is symmetrical is obtained by observing the visualization of
v and the activations are from the statistics on a small calibration set.

3.3
Distillation quantization calibration
To further fine-tune the clipping range, we propose distillation quantization calibration (DQC)
to transfer the knowledge from the FP model to the quantized model. It leverages the knowl-
edge distillation [15] where the FP model acts as the teacher while the quantized model is
the student.
Specifically, for the same input image, the student model needs to continu-
ously minimize the discrepancy with the teacher model on the final super-resolution output.

if v is symmetrical then

∆l ←(max(v) −min(v))/2K;
else

∆l ←0;
end
∆u ←(max(v) −min(v))/2K;
while i ≤K do

li ←l + i × ∆l, ui ←u + i × ∆u;
get vq based on Eq. (1);
mse ←∥v −vq∥2;
if mse ≤min_mse then

min_mse ←mse;
l_best ←li, u_best ←ui;
end
end

The loss for the final output can be written as

LO =
1
COHOWO
∥O −Oq∥1 ,
(4)

where O and Oq are the final outputs of the teacher
and student models, CO, HO, and WO represent the
number of output channels, height, and width, respec-
tively. we adopt the L1 loss for the final output, as
it tends to converge more easily compared to the L2
loss [33]. As the quantized model shares the same
structure with the FP model and is quantized from
the FP model, the student model also need to learn to
extract the same feature of the teacher model, which
can be written as

LF =

∥Fi∥2
−
Fqi
∥Fqi∥2


2
,
(5)

where Fi and Fqi are the intermediate features of the
teacher and student models respectively and i is the in-
dex of the layer. In the field of super-resolution, there
is a clear correspondence between the feature maps
and the final reconstructed images, making training
on feature maps crucial. since the quantized network

5


---Page Break---
and the full-precision network have identical structures, we do not need to add extra adaptation layers
for feature distillation. The final loss function can be written as
L = LO + λLF ,
(6)
where λ is the co-efficient of LF . In the second stage, based on training optimization methods, the gap
between the quantized model and the full-precision model will gradually decrease. The performance
of the quantized model will progressively improve and eventually converge to the optimal range.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental settings
Data and evaluation.
We use DF2K [40, 34] as the training data, which combines DIV2K [40] and
Flickr2K [34], as utilized by most SR models. During training, since we employ a distillation training
method, we do not need to use the high-resolution parts of the DF2K images. For validation, we use
the Set5 [2] as the validation set. After selecting the best model, we tested it on five commonly used
benchmarks in the SR field: Set5 [2], Set14 [45], B100 [36], Urban100 [18], and Manga109 [37]. On
the benchmarks, we input low-resolution images into the quantized model to obtain reconstructed
images, which we then compared with the high-resolution images to calculate the metrics. We
do not use self-ensemble in the test stage as it increases the computational load eightfold, but the
improvement in metrics is minimal The evaluation metrics we used are the most common metrics
PSNR and SSIM [43], which are calculated on the Y channel (i.e., luminance) of the YCbCr space.

Implementation details.
We use SwinIR-light [32] as the backbone and provide its structure in the
supplementary materials. We conduct comprehensive experiments with scale factors of 2, 3, and 4
and with 2, 3, and 4 bits, where Our hyperparameter settings remain consistent. During DOBI, we
use a search step number of K=100, and the statistics of activations are obtained from 32 images
in DF2K being randomly cropped to retain only 3×64×64. During DQC, we use the Adam [23]
optimizer with a learning rate of 1×10−2, betas set to (0.9, 0.999), and a weight decay of 0. We
employ CosineAnnealing [35] as the learning rate scheduler to stabilize the training process. Data
augmentation is also performed. We randomly utilize rotation of 90°, 180°, and 270° and horizontal
flips to augment the input image. The total iteration for training is 3,000 with batch size of 32. Our
code is written with Python and PyTorch [38] and runs on an NVIDIA A800-80G GPU.

Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
The methods we compared include MinMax [22], Percentile [27], and the current SOTA post-
quantization method in the super-resolution field, DBDC+Pac [41]. For a fair comparison, we report
the performance of DBDC+Pac [41] on EDSR [33], as the authors performed detailed parameter
adjustments and model training on EDSR. We directly used the results reported by the authors,
recorded in the table as EDSR†. It should be noted that the EDSR method uses self-ensemble in
the final test, which can improve performance to some extent but comes at the cost of 8 times the
computational load. Additionally, we applied DBDC+Pac [41] to SwinIR-light [32], using the same
hyperparameters as those set by the authors for EDSR, recorded in the table as DBDC+Pac [41]. The
following are the quantitative and qualitative results of the comparison.

2DQuant has an improvement of 0.69 dB and 1.18 dB compared to the SOTA method. All these
results indicate that our two-stage PTQ method can effectively mitigate the degradation caused by
quantization and ensure the quality of the reconstructed images.

Figure 5 shows the bound percentile of DOBI searching and DQC. Overall, the bound of DQC is
tighter as the values around the zero point enjoy greater importance. Besides, the shallow layers’

(c) DOBI and DQC
Table 4: Ablation studies. The models are trained on DIV2K and Flickr2K, and tested on Set5 (×2).

bounds vary more significantly due to the elevated significance of these layers within the neural
network. Detailedly, the bound for the second MLP fully connected layer’s weight in Layer 0 Block 1
only remains 46% data in its range. It has the second-highest lower bound percentile and the smallest
upper bound percentile among the network. Its percentiles are 0.2401 and 0.7035 respectively while
its bound values are -0.062 and 0.047 and its distribution is visualized in Figure 4. In conclusion, only
through task-oriented optimization of each bound at a fine-grained level can redundant information
be maximally excluded and useful information be maximally retained.

Qualitative results.
We show the visual comparison results for ×4 in Figure 6. Since quantized
models are derived from full-precision models with information loss, their global performance
will rarely exceed that of full-precision models. As seen in the three images for Minmax, after
quantization, if no clipping is performed, the long tail effect will lead to a large number of useless
bits, resulting in a significant amount of noise and repeated distorted patterns in the reconstructed
images. In these challenging cases, our training method allows the model to retain edge information
of objects better, preventing blurring and distorted effects. For example, in img_046 and img_023,
we have the highest similarity to the full-precision model, while other methods show varying degrees
of edge diffusion, significantly affecting image quality. Compared to the DBDC+Pac method, our
DOBI and DQC allow for better representation of edge and texture information in the images and
effectively avoid distortions and misalignments in the graphics. The visual results demonstrate that
our proposed DQC is essential for improving performance in both metric and visual comparisons.

Ablation study
Learning rate and batchsize.
We first study the performance variations of the model under
different hyperparameters. From Tables 4a and 4b, it can be seen that our DQC enables the model to

8


---Page Break---
converge within a range of outstanding performance for most learning rates and batch sizes. Due
to the non-smooth impact of quantization parameters on the model, the quantized model is more
prone to local optima compared to the full-precision model, resulting in a noticeable performance
drop when the learning rate is too low. Additionally, as shown in Table 4b, the larger the batch size,
the better the model’s performance, and the smoother the convergence process. However, even with
a smaller batch size, we can still achieve a performance of 37.82dB on Set5, indicating that our
two-stage method has good robustness to different hyperparameters.

DOBI and DQC.
Moreover, we also study the impact of different stages on performance, with the
results shown in Table 4c, from which we can draw the following conclusions: Firstly, the goal of
DOBI is to minimize the value shift for weights and activations. Although it is not the task goal, it can
still enjoy significant enhancement due to better bit representational ability. Secondly, DQC alone
cannot achieve the optimization effect of DOBI. This is because the impact of quantizer parameters
on model performance is oscillatory, and training alone is prone to converge to local optima. In
contrast, search-based methods can naturally avoid local optima. So it’s necessary to use results from
the search-based method to initialize training-based method in PTQ. Thirdly, when DOBI and DQC
are combined, namely our 2DQuant, the 4-bit quantized model has only a 0.28dB decrease on Set5
compared to the FP model, which maximally mitigates the accuracy loss caused by quantization.

Discussion

Why our results surpass FP outcomes.
While our method’s performance metrics do not yet fully
match those of full-precision models, visual results reveal a compelling advantage. As observed
in image img_092 of Figure 1 of Urban100, our approach correctly identifies the direction of the
stripes in the image. Whereas the full-precision model erroneously selects the wrong direction.
This discrepancy arises because the lower-resolution image, affected by aliasing, creates an illusion
of slanted stripes, misleading the FP model’s reconstruction. This phenomenon demonstrates that
our PTQ algorithm allows more accurate restored results in certain localized and challenging tasks
without being misled. More examples are in the supplementary materials.
It suggests that full-precision models contain not only redundant knowledge but also incorrect
information. The latter is hard to get rid of by training the FP model. Our quantization method
can effectively reduce model parameters and computational demands while eliminating erroneous
information, achieving multiple benefits simultaneously. This also suggests that the FP model doesn’t
represent the pinnacle of what a quantized model can achieve.

Limitations.
Despite achieving excellent results, this study still has some limitations. During
the DOBI process, the data distribution of activations and weights is required to approximate a
bell curve or exponential distribution; otherwise, the DOBI method cannot find the most suitable
positions. Additionally, increasing the number of search points for a single tensor in MSE does not
necessarily guarantee better performance. However, the second-stage training can somewhat alleviate
this issue. Moreover, our method requires a calibration set; without which, the first-stage DOBI and

Conclusion
This paper studies the post-training quantization in the field of image super-resolution. We first
conducted a detailed analysis of the data distribution of Transformer-based model in SR. These
data exhibit a clear long-tail effect and symmetry and asymmetry coexisting effect. We designed
2DQuant, a dual-stage PTQ algorithms. In the first stage DOBI, we designed two different search
strategies for the two different distributions. In the second stage DQC, we designed a distillation-
based training method that let the quantized model learn from the FP model, minimizing the accuracy
loss caused by quantization. Our 2DQuant can compress Transformer-based model to 4,3,2 bits with
the compression ratio being 3.07×, 3.31×, and 3.60× and speedup ratio being 3.99×, 4.47×, and
5.08×. No additional module is added so 2DQuant enjoys the theoretical upper limit of compression
and speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 2DQuant surpasses all existing PTQ methods in
the field of SR and even surpasses the FP model in some challenging cases. In the future, recognizing
the significant impact of the model on performance, we will conduct PTQ research on more advanced
super-resolution models and attempt to deploy quantized super-resolution algorithms to actual
photography tasks, providing a more detailed evaluation of the performance of PTQ algorithms.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to our abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations in the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

12


---Page Break---
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in
the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide
intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided implementation details in the experiments section. We will also release
all the code and models.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.

13


---Page Break---
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Firstly, all data in the paper can be accessed publicly. Secondly, we provide very detailed
instructions (e.g., method descriptions and implementation details) to reproduce our results. Thirdly,
we promise to release code and all models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided implementation details, which cover the above questions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the experiment part.

14


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to experiment part.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the supplementary file.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.

15


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have credited most previous works in the paper. The license and terms are respected
properly.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

16


---Page Break---
Justification: We will release code and models. In the paper, we have provided implementation details
and other contents to reproduce our results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
