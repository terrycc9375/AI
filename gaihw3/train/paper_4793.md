Abstract

To evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA), tradi-
tional methods typically focus on assessing single-turn responses to given questions.
However, this approach doesn’t capture the dynamic nature of human-AI inter-
actions, where humans actively seek information through conversation.2. Recent
works in human-computer interaction (HCI) have employed human evaluators to
conduct interactions and evaluations, but they are often prohibitively expensive
and time-consuming to scale. We introduce an automatic evaluation framework
IQA-EVAL to achieve Interactive Question Answering Evaluations3, more specifi-
cally, we introduce a LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) that can: (1) simulate
human behaviors to generate interactions with IQA models; (2) automatically
evaluate the generated interactions. Moreover, we propose assigning personas to
LEAs to better simulate groups of real human evaluators. We show that: (1) our
evaluation framework with GPT-4 (or Claude) as the backbone model achieves a
high correlation with human evaluations on the IQA task; (2) assigning personas
to LEA to better represent the crowd further significantly improves correlations.
Finally, we use our automatic metric to evaluate five recent representative LLMs
with over 1000 questions from complex and ambiguous question answering tasks,
which comes with a substantial cost of $5k if evaluated by humans.

Introduction

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of natural language
processing (NLP), enabling systems to perform a wide range of tasks with remarkable proficiency
[Zhao et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2024; Du, 2024b; Jing et al., 2024]. Among these
tasks, question answering (QA) has emerged as a critical and representative goal-oriented application,
demonstrating the potential of LLMs to generate informative responses as an assistant [Biancofiore
et al., 2024]. Multiple methods have been proposed to enhance the faithfulness and explainability
of generated information [Wei et al., 2022b; Long, 2023; Li and Du, 2023; Du, 2024a]. Beyond
developing these methods, rigorous evaluation of the generated outputs is also crucial.

Accurate and consistent evaluation helps researchers understand existing LLM’s capacities and
emerging human-LLM QA interactions [Chang et al., 2023; Lin and Chen, 2023; Chang et al., 2023].
Traditionally, automatic metrics such as accuracy have been used to evaluate models based on the

Figure 1: An example of human-model interactive question answering (IQA) and our automatic
evaluation (IQA-EVAL). The two interactions occur with two types of personas in humans (or
LLM-based evaluation agents): Expert and Clarity-seeker, and are evaluated by humans or agents
with corresponding personas. The IQA model only responds to the immediately preceding prompt
without further contexts like the question itself (leftmost in the Figure).

quality of their direct answers to specific questions. However, as interactions between humans
and LLMs grow more complex and nuanced, these traditional metrics often fail to capture the full
spectrum of a model’s capabilities (e.g. helpfulness and fluency), particularly in interactive QA
settings [Liu et al., 2016; Deriu et al., 2021], whereas interactions are crucial for user experience and
system effectiveness, yet remains overlooked in traditional evaluation paradigms. Recent works such
as [Lee et al., 2023] evaluated human-LLM interactions, a process that involves human participation
and annotation. Although human evaluations for these interactions provide a closer approximation to
real-world use cases, this approach is significantly costly and time-consuming. Recognizing the need
for automatic evaluation, works like G-Eval [Liu et al., 2023b], LLM-Eval [Lin and Chen, 2023],
FaithScore [Jing et al., 2023], and PRD [Li et al., 2024] proposed to automate the assessment of
non-interactive LLM responses using LLMs as evaluators.

Drawing insights from (a) using LLM for automatic evaluation and (b) literature of LLM-agents
research Wang et al. [2024]; Deshpande et al. [2023], we propose IQA-EVAL framework to auto-
evaluate the performance of IQA models (i.e. LLMs) with LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) to
simulate and then evaluate interactions. By additionally incorporating personas, our experiments
on a well-annotated dataset show that our methods align well with human judgments and provide
a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in interactive settings than traditional metrics. Finally,
we benchmark recent LLMs with new complex and ambiguous questions, and demonstrate that
the accuracy of answers does not always transfer to the corresponding ranking of models on their
capability of achieving good human-model interactions. See an overview of our system in Figure 1.

Our contributions are as follows:

• We propose the first LLM agent-based automatic evaluation framework IQA-EVAL designed
specifically to generate and then evaluate interactions in IQA. Our results demonstrate a strong
correlation with human evaluations.
• We propose persona-based LLM evaluation agents to better assess how models adapt to different
user preferences and interaction styles.
• We experiment with IQA-EVAL framework to benchmark the most recent LLMs on the IQA
task, demonstrating the strength and general effectiveness of our framework on fully automated
evaluation.

Related Work

Evaluating Interactions
Traditional methods for human-model dialogue evaluation have often
been centered around single-turn pairwise evaluation [Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2016]. Some

2


---Page Break---
methods with multi-turn Likert scores emerge [Venkatesh et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; See
et al., 2019] but require time-consuming and costly collection of human-model conversations. In
response, Ghandeharioun et al. [2019] suggests a self-play scenario where a dialog system engages in
conversation with itself, employing a set of proxy measures for evaluation.

Acute-eval [Li et al., 2019] and LLM-Eval [Lin and Chen, 2023] have advanced multi-turn evaluation
frameworks, reflecting the increasing demand for sophisticated techniques that holistically capture
human-AI interactions. Further studies in specific interaction domains like task completion [Liu
et al., 2023a], code generation [Yang et al., 2023], and collaborative problem-solving [Lee et al.,
2023; Huang et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023] emphasize the need for evaluations that consider both
environmental and human elements [Wang et al., 2023b]. Our work differs from these methods by
introducing an automated approach that emphasizes interaction quality and significantly reduces the
reliance on human annotations.

LLM-based Agent for Simulation
Recently, LLMs rises to demonstrate human-like intelligence,
as evidenced in various studies [Xiao et al., 2023; Rao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,
2023; bench authors, 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The
integration of LLMs into agents that simulate complex human behaviors and social interactions is an
area of growing research interest [Maes, 1995; Wooldridge and Jennings, 1995; Xi et al., 2023]. For
example, Park et al. [2022] and Gao et al. [2023] employ these agents to simulate human emotions,
attitudes, and behaviors in social networks, while Park et al. [2023] leverages in-context learning to
simulate human behaviors in sandbox world. Moreover, Argyle et al. [2022] utilizes “algorithmic
bias" inherent in GPT-3 to reflect the response patterns of different human subgroups. Horton [2023]
utilize LLMs in experimental setups of behavioral economics experiments to facilitate pilot studies.
Additionally, Hämäläinen et al. [2023] and Wang et al. [2023a] investigate LLM-based agents in
recommender systems to simulate and collect data on user behavior. These studies show the broad
applicability and potential of LLM-based agents in simulating human behaviors and interactions
across diverse applications. Our work utilizes LLM-based evaluation agents (LEAs) to fully automate
interactive quality assessments, handling both interaction generation and evaluation, to enhance the
evaluation of IQA models in realistic scenarios.

Personas in NLP
Personas are constructed profile prompts that represent key traits of a group
of users, as defined in the HCI field, reflecting their characteristics, behaviors, and goals to guide
the design of technologies that are well-suited to user needs [Cooper et al., 2014]. This approach
enhances relevance and personalization in NLP applications [Nargund et al., 2022; Bamman, 2015;
Sheng et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2020], offering significant potential for customizing engagement
and improving the effectiveness of conversational agents [Li et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Chan
et al., 2019; Madotto et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019]. Li et al. [2016] introduces a persona-based
neural conversation model to enhance dialogue personalization and coherence. Zhang et al. [2018]
develops personalized dialogue agents that incorporate user-specific details to enhance interaction.
In our work, persona settings enable our framework to tailor interactions and assessments, aligning
more closely with the specific characteristics and preferences of different user groups.

IQA-EVAL: Evaluating Interactive Question Answering (IQA)

In this section, we introduce our IQA-EVAL framework for automatically evaluating Interaction
Question Answering Models (IQA models) with LLM-based Evaluation Agents (LEA). LEAs are
used to simulate humans in the following two stages: (1) generating interactions with IQA models;
and (2) evaluating interactions. Lastly, we discuss the use of personas to for LEAs.

3.1
Interaction Generation with LEA (Stage 1)

Inspired by peer discussions Lee et al. [2023]; Wang et al. [2024], we prompt LEAs to simulate human
behaviors for effective interaction generation with IQA models. The structured prompt includes three
key components: (1) a role description; (2) a task description; and (3) instructions for the discussion.

Role Description outlines the people that the LEA model will simulate during interactions. For
example, the description for a standard persona could be: You are mimicking a human.

Task Description briefly describes the action that LEA model needs to perform in the task. For
example, in a multi-choice question answering task, the prompt could be structured as follows: You

3


---Page Break---
are trying to choose the correct answer for the given question. Both role and
task descriptions can be adjusted based on the persona, as discussed in Section 3.3.

Discussion instruction guides LEAs on their subsequent steps by providing detailed descriptions to
facilitate progress in interactions. It comprises two essential components: (1) the actions to take; and
(2) the detailed procedures to follow. For example, in a question answering task, the prompt specifies:
You can ask an assistant questions for help.
Please ask sub-questions
to approach answers.
In each turn, please only ask one sub-question to
interact with the assistant.

In the sub-question, please include all necessary information in the
original question, such as the question and all options.
If you know
the answer, please output "So, the answer is:
A, B, C, or D".

At the start of an interaction, the LEA receives a system prompt that includes all three components
above, along with the specific question to be addressed. As the LEA interacts with the IQA model, it
generates sub-questions to request clarification of unknown entities, definitions, or particular aspects
of the original question. Then, the IQA Model takes the questions as the input and output responses.
After receiving responses, the LEA continues to pose further questions until it determines the final
answer. The full prompt structure and interaction details are provided in Appendix C.2.

3.2
Interaction Evaluation with LEA (Stage 2)

Inspired by G-eval [Liu et al., 2023b], which demonstrates that evaluations by GPT models align
closely with human assessments in NLG tasks, we propose utilizing LEAs for interaction evaluation.
LEAs assess interactions generated by LEAs and IQAs in Stage 1. The module takes task details,
such as questions or articles, and interactions as the input, and output evaluation scores. The prompt
contains three parts: (1) role and task description; (2) metrics definition; and (3) evaluation instruction.

Role and task description instructs LEA to conduct evaluation. The role description acts the same
as the role description in the previous stage. Moreover, it briefly describes the evaluation task. The
general prompt looks like: You are a helpful and precise evaluator who checks the
quality of the AI assistant’s responses in interactions.

Metrics definitions describes the criterion that LEA needs to follow in the evaluation process. They
can customized for different tasks. For the question answering task, we add the following prompt to
define the “helpfulness” metric:

Helpfulness (5-point Likert):
How helpful was having access to the
AI Assistant compared to not having access?

Both the aforementioned parts can be tailored according to the persona that the LEA simulates in
Stage 1, as detailed in Section 3.3.

Evaluation instruction outlines the specifics of the evaluation task and the required output format.
This section may appear as a separate part of the prompt. For example, the instruction within the
prompt might be structured as follows:

Please evaluate the above interactions between user and AI assistant
by using the following metrics:
<Metric definitions>
Please output each of the above metrics line-by-line.

Finally, all evaluation scores for metrics are calculated by averaging the results of multiple runs. The
complete prompt is available in Appendix C.1, and further details about our implementation can be
found in Section 4.

3.3
Assigning the Personas to LEA

Both aforementioned evaluation stages typically use a default persona. While this constitutes a some-
what neutral baseline in knowledge, language proficiency, and beliefs to bo baseline, individual users
often exhibit diverse personal preferences and characteristics, making a one-size-fits-all evaluation
less effective. Moreover, the persona distribution of the target user group significantly impacts the
performance of IQA models in real-world applications. For instance, if 20% of human users prefer

4


---Page Break---
brief interactions and 70% prefer detailed information, applying a general LEA to simulate this group
of persons is likely to result in poor correlation with downstream users.

To better simulate the diversity of the groups of people and provide individualized evaluations,
we assign personas to LEAs. This affects prompts of both interaction generation and interaction
evaluation processes.

For example, when the LEA is assigned with the “Critical-Seeker” persona (definition in C.3) for
interaction generation, we adapt the default role and task description (in Stage 1) to:
You prefer interactions rich in critical information.
You need help from
an assistant and try to get critical information from it to answer the
following questions. For interaction evaluation, the default role and task description prompt
changes
to
The AI Assistant should provide straightforward, simple, and
concise answers to aid users in deducing solutions. Additionally, the definition of
metrics is also adjusted to align with this persona, with further details available in Appendix C.3.

Meta-Evaluation of IQA-EVAL Framework

To measure how our framework provides trustworthy IQA evaluations that align with human prefer-
ences, we conduct meta-evaluations experiments and report correlation scores.

4.1
Experiment Settings

Dataset and Evaluation Metrics
We apply our evaluation method on the annotated dataset from the
study by Lee et al. [2023]. This dataset consists of 3641 interactions from 331 annotators. Questions
in the dataset are multi-choice and are derived from the MMLU dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2020] (exam-
ple question in Figure 1). The construction of MMLU requires each worker to participate in 11 random
conversations with one of the following three IQA models: TextDavinci (text-davinci-001),
TextBabbage (text-babbage-001), and Davinci (davinci-001). At the end of conversa-
tions, fluency and helpfulness scores are annotated by annotators. The number of queries and accuracy
for each IQA model can be easily deduced from annotations. In this work, We adjust the four metrics
to evaluate generated interactions:

• Fluency (5-point Likert): How clear (or fluent) were the responses from the AI Assistant?
• Helpfulness (5-point Likert): Independent of its fluency, how helpful was having access to the
AI Assistant compared to not having access?
• Number of Queries: Counts the number of interaction turns in the conversation. This metric
helps assess the efficiency of the AI in resolving queries within a minimal number of interactions.
• Accuracy: Quantifies how accurately the AI’s responses match the golden answers. This is
critical for evaluating the correctness of the AI’s knowledge and its application in practical
scenarios.

LEA Models
To evaluate the effectiveness of IQA-EVAL framework, we experiment with different
LEA models on the above-mentioned three LLMs IQA models in MMLU. For LEA that conducts
both interaction generation and interaction evaluation, we use ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo-1106),
GPT4 (GPT-4-1106-preview), Claude (Claude-1).

Evaluation of IQA-EVAL Framework
We report Pearson correlations as the measrue of agree-
ment between the Human evaluations and LEA evaluations of IQA models.

4.2
Experiment Results

According to Table 2, all models, including GPT4, GPT3.5, and Claude, show high correlation with
human evaluations. GPT4 aligns most closely with human judgments in both “Helpfulness” and
“Fluency" metrics and the highest overall correlation score. This indicates that these models are
capable of effectively performing IQA-EVAL framework as LEA models.

In Table 1, ChatGPT scores closest to human judgments, particularly in the "Helpfulness" metric.
Conversely, GPT4 and Claude score lower on "Helpfulness" than human evaluations, because they
tend to produce inaccurate and repetitive responses that lack coherence and do not directly address

user queries, as indicated by their generated explanations. IQA-Eval scores on “Fluency” are close
and highly correlated to human judgments. Both scores given by humans and LEA models show that
IQA models provide fluent outputs. Furthermore, according to the "# Queries" metric, most models
conclude conversations more quickly than humans, except for Claude, which requires more turns,
potentially due to its non-OpenAI origins that it needs more turns to adapt the conversational style and
understand responses. Notably, GPT4 achieves the highest accuracy among all models. Moreover, we
consider the impact of self-enhancement bias and conduct more experiments. Details are in Section
6.4.

Figure 2: Interaction evaluation results evaluated by human and two LEA models on interactions
between real human and IQA Models. All scores are on a scale of 5.

Results are in shown Figures 2a and 2b. The Pearson correlation coefficients for fluency and
helpfulness between human judgments and LEA evaluations show distinct patterns. ChatGPT
demonstrates a stronger correlation with human ratings, recording a correlation score of 0.424
for fluency and a correlation score of 0.306 for helpfulness. In contrast, Claude shows slightly lower
correlations (0.281 for fluency and 0.287 for helpfulness). This shows that ChatGPT aligns better
with human compared to Claude in these specific metrics.

Moreover, for interactions between humans and IQA models (Figure 2), LEA evaluations moderately
correlate with human evaluations. However, for interactions between LEAs and IQA models (Table
2), which is the main focus of our paper, LEA evaluations highly correlate (around 0.6) with human
evaluations. This indicates that LEA models are helpful when participating in the whole evaluation
process, including both the interaction and evaluation. However, when evaluating interactions between
humans and IQA models, LEAs focus differently from humans, which causes moderate correlations.

Thus, the results show that (1) both models’ evaluations moderately correlate with human evaluation;
(2) ChatGPT’s evaluation is closer and related to human evaluation than Claude’s.

4.3
Further Analysis for Free-form Feedback

Apart from the metrics above, we also prompt LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) to explain the
reason for generating scores in the free-form text format. We find that: 1) ChatGPT Generates more
human-like, positive reviews: ChatGPT evaluations are generally more positive, frequently using
terms like “helpful”, “relevant”, and “useful” – words not always noted by workers in their annota-
tions. Despite this, ChatGPT often identifies similar issues as human raters, such as the provision of
irrelevant and repetitive information. Overall, ChatGPT’s assessments align well with human evalua-
tions; 2) Claude flags more Issues: Claude is more strict and critical to IQA models in interactions.
In the free-text feedback, Claude tends to highlight more issues with model responses rather than
acknowledging positive aspects, especially for Davinci. For one question, after interacting with the
IQA model/assistant (ChatGPT in this case), human and two LEAs provide the following feedback:
Human:
When rephrasing questions well, the answers could be found in the
AI’s response.
ChatGPT: The AI assistant was helpful in providing relevant information,
but there were issues with the accuracy.
Claude:
The AI assistant’s responses were not very helpful.
The
responses were often vague, repetitive, or did not directly answer the
question.

5
Effect of Assigning Persona to LLM Evaluation Agent (LEA)

5.1
Persona Definitions

As discussed in Section 3.3, we assign personas to LEAs to simulate different groups of humans
for diverse human alignments. We investigate assigning the following personas to LEAs, which are
defined based on the crowdworker survey results in Lee et al. [2023].

• Expert: knowledgeable; quickly learns new concepts and applies them in the reasoning process to
answer questions.
• Critical-Thinker: people who prefer critical information rather than redundant or detailed responses.
• Adaptability-Seeker: people who prefer assistants can understand their questions even if they are
not precise.
• Clarity-Seeker: people who prefer clear explanations from assistants.

Based on the survey results on the distributions of personas of workers Lee et al. [2023], for each
persona P, we split the crowdworkers into two groups: “persons with persona P”, and “normal
persons without specific persona P”. For the first group, we initialize the role prompt in Section 3.3
and use it for the LEAs. For the second group, we utilize default prompting for LEAs. The LEA
model in this section is ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-turbo-1106).

5.2
Experimental Results

In Table 3, we show the results of model (with personas) evaluations. To accurately simulate persona
distribution, each interaction is executed multiple times, with different personas (including the
standard one) assigned to LEA based on their distribution proportions. This method ensures that each
persona’s influence and characteristics are proportionally represented in the simulation, reflecting
their respective prevalence within the overall distribution. The final score for a persona is an average
of all experiment results.

The “Expert” persona decrease LEA query counts as “Expert” already possesses relevant knowledge
and only needs key explanations. The “Clarity-Seeker” requires the most interaction turns among
all personas for comprehension, but achieves the highest accuracy with TextBabbage and Davinci
through detailed understanding of questions.

“Critic-Thinker” and “Adapability-Seeker” in Tables 3 and 4 rarely surpass upon the standard persona’s
human-preference aligment. We hypothesize that these personas are less reflected within the overall
distributions of human preferences. In Table 3, the varying “# Queries” across personas reveals
their significant influence on LEA interaction strategies. Accuracy remains consistent after adding
personas, showing no performance degradation.

Together, these results indicate that assigning specific personas steer LEAs to perform IQA-EVAL in
a more fine-grained and human-aligned way.

It is worth nothing that our analysis of persona reassignment shows IQA-EVAL is sensitive to
incorrect assignments (see Appendix E). Moreover, further analyses about bias evaluation, as well as
measuring complementary metrics like offensiveness, are in Appendix G.

Benchmarking LLMs with IQA-EVAL on more Types of Questions

6.1
Datasets

To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of our evaluation framework, we conduct bench-
marking across different models on two distinct question answering datasets, each offering unique
challenges and complexities requiring advanced reasoning. AmbigQA Min et al. [2020] is a col-
lection of 14,042 annotated questions sourced from the NQ-OPEN benchmarks Kwiatkowski et al.
[2019a], an open-domain QA dataset. It focuses on questions with inherent ambiguities, reflecting the
complexity encountered in real-world queries. These ambiguities often involve diverse aspects such as
events, entity references, and answer types, resulting in multiple plausible answers for each question.
HotpotQA Yang et al. [2018] comprises 113,000 question-answer pairs sourced from Wikipedia,
which require multi-hop reasoning spanning multiple documents. It contains a rich array of intricate
questions that demand the synthesis of information from various texts to determine accurate answers.
In this benchmark, we select 500 questions from each dataset to form a dataset containing 1,000
complex multi-hop and ambiguous questions.

Benchmarking Results

The IQA evaluation benchmarks are presented in Table 5. We divide IQA Models into two categories:
weak IQA Models (TextDavinci, TextBabbage, and Davinci) and strong IQA Models (GPT3.5,
GPT4, Claude, Llama2, and Zephyr). Weak IQA Models can assist the LEA with answering
HotpotQA questions, but due to their knowledge limitations, they cannot help much with AmbigQA
questions. Zephyr achieves the lowest performance compared to other strong IQA Models. On the
HotpotQA dataset, Zephyr’s accuracy performance is only comparable to the strongest one among
weak IQA Models, TextDavinci.

Most “Helpfulness” and “Fluency” scores are high (exceeding 3 out of 5), especially for strong IQA
Models like GPT4. For the “# of queries”, it is uncommon for interactions to extend beyond two turns.
As on HotpotQA, most interactions conclude at the beginning of the second turn, as IQA models
have effectively guided users to reach the answers. For AmbigQA, some conversations last longer
whereas LEA spends additional turns on clarifying ambiguous entities before approaching the final
answer. Additional benchmarking results on the Natural Question dataset are in Appendix D.

6.4
Self-Enhancement Bias

LLMs are shown to demonstrate self-favouring behaviours [Panickssery et al., 2024], and no verified
or accessible mitigations to this issue exist to the best of our knowledge. This issue is particularly
concerning when the LEA models evaluating the IQA models share the same underlying model. In
this section, we discuss our two of our attempts to assess the effects of this bias.

Following Zheng et al. [2023] and Furniturewala et al. [2024], we included some empirically useful
debiasing instructions as follows:

Please act as an impartial and unbiased judge.
In your evaluation,
please be objective and do not include any bias or your preference.

In Table 5, scores on the row of GPT3.5 is vulnerable to self-enhancement bias. However, with the
above debiasing prompt, in Table 7 shows that the results of new prompts are highly similar to the
original prompts. Similarly, Table 6 shows that the results of modified and original prompts are differ
only lightly.

We also designed a second methodology to mitigate self-enhancement bias. In this experiment,
multiple LEA models evaluate the performance of IQA models during each interaction (“Multi-
perspective”). In other words, we introduced third-party evaluations, where various LEA models
assess the IQA models’ performance instead of relying solely on the LEA model itself involved
in the interaction. After evaluation, we use the average score from all LEA models as the final
score. The results of IQA-Eval-Multi-perspective look as in Table 8. The correlations between
IQA-Eval-Multi-perspective and human evaluations are in Table 9.

We believe that that the self-preference bias has limited impact on IQA-Eval.

Stronger IQA models require fewer turns in interac-
tions.
On the more challenging AmbigQA, the stronger
model, GPT4, typically requires only one turn to assist
LEA in solving questions with high accuracy. In contrast,
less capable models like Llama2 and GPT3.5 need more
turns to clarify ambiguous entities and have lower QA
accuracies. A similar trend is observed on the HotpotQA.

We obtain a similar model ranking with a much lower
cost.
Compared to Chatbot Arena 4, our accuracy-based
ranking of IQA Models follows a similar trend: GPT4 > Claude > GPT3.5 > Llama2 > Zephyr. In
addition, our evaluation method, IQA-EVAL, is fully automated. Our method makes it a cost-effective
alternative for large-scale evaluations.

Evaluation of interaction performance does not always match Non-Interaction performance.
In interaction evaluations, accuracy on final results is not the only metric to show IQA Models’
performance. The quality of intermediate responses is a significant aspect. On both “helpfulness”
and “fluency” metrics, Claude is always the best IQA Model on HotpotQA questions, while on
AmbigQA, Llama2 and GPT3.5 outperform GPT4. IQA Model rankings on these two aspects differ
from those in Chatbot Arena (non-interaction).

The performance of IQA Models largely affects the final performance.
The accuracies in both
Table 5 and Table 10 show a consistent trend. The Pearson correlations of the accuracy between
the tables are 0.77 and 0.87 on both datasets, respectively. A strong IQA model, such as GPT4,
can lead the LEA to finish tasks and largely improve the LEA’s performance on those tasks. Weak
assistants may drag down the LEA’s performance, such as the performance of the LEA on both
datasets decreases after interacting with Zephyr.

Conclusion

To conclude, we introduced IQA-EVAL, a novel approach for evaluating interactive question-
answering systems using large language models. Our methodology achieves automatic interaction
generation and evaluation with LEA, and enhances the evaluation process by assigning personas to
LEA for better matching diverse groups of people. We show that our approach aligns closely with
real human interactions and judgment, indicating that a scalable, automatic IQA-EVAL process can
be achieved. We providing insights on recent LLM’s capability in conducting IQA with IQA-EVAL
which would cost $5,000 for human evaluations.

A
Limitations

In conducting this study, certain limitations have influenced our scope and findings. First and foremost,
LLMs are shown to demonstrate self-favouring behaviours [Panickssery et al., 2024], and no verified
or accessible mitigations to this issue exist to the best of our knowledge. We discuss some of our
attempts to address this in Section 6.4, but this limitation necessitates future research.

Our methodology was applied exclusively to multi-choice question-answering tasks due to constraints
imposed by the datasets used. Moreover, we do not investigate how allowing prompt editing could
affect the results. This choice limits the generalizability of our findings across the wider array of
question answering formats that exist in both academic research and practical applications.

We advocate for subsequent research efforts to extend the application of our proposed evaluation
strategies to a more diverse set of question answering tasks, beyond the multi-choice format.

Furthermore, there is a significant opportunity to test these methods with a broader spectrum of
LLMs, including those at the cutting edge of the field. Such expansions would not only validate the
versatility and robustness of our approaches but also potentially uncover additional insights into the
nuances of LLM interaction and performance in varied contexts.

B
Ethics Statement

In our study, we meticulously crafted each persona to mitigate bias, ensuring they do not adversely
impact the IQA-Eval process, as evidenced by the results presented in the table above. However, our
personas represent only a limited range. There exists the potential for negative effects from other
personas that may be inadequately designed or deliberately biased to achieve specific outcomes. Thus,
we oppose irresponsible persona designs that result in biased evaluation results. The principle of
persona definition and design should be thoroughly studied in future works. We hope our work will
help facilitate future research into better automatic interaction evaluations aligning with crowds.

C
Prompts

Both C.1 and C.2 are adapted from Lee et al. [2023]. All the following prompts are from the view of
LEA in interactions.

C.1
Interaction Evaluation Prompt

We follow the setting in the data and evaluate conversations worker-wise. In other words, we combine
conversations for each worker and send all of them to evaluators. The prompt we send to APIs follows

16


---Page Break---
the following format:

You are a helpful and precise assistant for checking the quality
of the AI assistant’s responses in interactions.

{Question 1}
{Golden Answer 1}
{Conversation 1}
{User Answer 1}
· · ·
{Question n}
{Golden Answer n}
{Conversation n}
{User Answer n}

Please evaluate the above conversations between user and AI assistant
by using the following metrics:
Fluency (5-point Likert):
How clear (or fluent) were the responses
from the AI Assistant?
Helpfulness (5-point Likert):
Independent of its fluency, how helpful
was having access to the AI Assistant compared to not having access?
Helpfulness (free-form):
Why did you find the AI Assistant helpful
or unhelpful?
Please output each of the above metrics line-by-line.

C.2
Interaction Generation Prompt

Since this is a multi-choice question answering task, the full prompt for models is as follows:

You are mimicking a human.
You are trying to choose the correct answer to the given question.
Please ask an assistant sub-questions for help approaching answers.
In each turn, please only ask one sub-question to interact with an
assistant.
In the sub-questions, please include all necessary
information, such as the question and options, in the original
question.
If you know the answer, please output "So, the answer
is:
A, B, C, or D."

{QA Question and choices}
{User Model’s query:
[question 1]}
{Assistant’s answer:
[answer 1]}
{User Model’s query:
[question 2]}
{Assistant’s answer:
[answer 2]}
· · ·
{User Model’s query:
[question n]}
{Assistant’s answer:
[answer n]}
{User Model’s final answer}

If the current turn reaches the maximum number we set, the system prompt before “{Question}”
looks as follows:

Please choose the correct answer to the given question.
Please
output "So, the answer is:
A, B, C, or D."

C.2.1
QA Question and choices format

The question prompt for multi-choice questions in MMLU is as follows:

<question>
A. <option A>
B. <option B>
C. <option C>
D. <option D>

For HotpotQA and AmbigQA datasets, the question prompt only contains a question, such as:
<question>

C.3
Persona Prompts

We design distinct prompts for each persona. Both prompts in meta-evaluation and model interaction
modules change with personas.

In model interaction prompts, we only modify the first sentence based on personas. See all persona
prompts in Table 11.

D
Additional Experiments on Natural Questions

We benchmark IQA models in another dataset called Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al. [2019b]).
This dataset comprises authentic questions posed by users about Wikipedia articles, demanding true
multi-turn dialogues for resolution, akin to the setup in multi-turn conversational QA dataset QuAC
(Choi et al. [2018]). The experiment results are as in Tables 12 and 13. All numbers of queries in the
two tables are around 3, and each response to a query from IQA models contains an average of 2
sentences.

Given the number of sentences in each IQA model’s response in Table 14, the non-interactive outputs
are roughly equivalent to about two interaction turns, less than three turns in interactive outputs. Thus,
The interaction process of IQA-EVAL involves not only reasoning processes but also simulating
genuine interactive multi-turn conversations. This suggests that the performances shown in tables 12
and 13 above are driven more by multi-turn interactions than by reasoning processes. Furthermore,
these interactions lead to enhanced accuracy, as demonstrated by the superior results in the first two
tables compared to those in the last table (non-interactive).

E
Sensitive to Persona Distributions

We conduct two new experiments to study the effects of changing persona assignments. Results
indicate that IQA-EVAL is sensitive to incorrect persona assignments. When the persona distribution

is incorrect (such as 20% Expert in Table 15), the performance of IQA-EVAL shows a lower
correlation with human evaluations.

Moreover, the last two lines in Table 15 describe the correlation between human evaluations and
IQA-EVAL within a sub-group only containing pure experts. The correlation results in line “IQA-
EVAL (Pure Expert)” represent that (1) our personas accurately represent the pure expert group, as
its correlation with the line “Human (Pure Expert)” remains nearly consistent with those in line
“IQA-EVAL (Expert)” and (2) given this completely correct persona distribution, our IQA-EVAL
correlates well with human evaluations.

F
Accurate QA models are preferred by humans in IQA-EVAL

The quote from our cited paper Lee et al. [2023] is “[...] perception of helpfulness is not necessarily
reflected in the overall interaction accuracy.” It describes the conclusion of multiple tasks in that
paper (e.g. text summarization, social dialogue, QA). However, in the QA settings, Table 3 in Lee
et al. [2023] shows that humans prefer accurate models on the QA task.

We also conducted experiments (1) using LEA to evaluate interactions between LEAs and IQA models
(interactive) and (2) using LEA to evaluate direct answers generated by IQA models (non-interactive).
Our experiments in Tables 16 and 17 show that LEA models prefer accurate models, which aligns
well with the conclusion from human annotations.

G
Bias Evaluation

We follow the method proposed by Sheng et al. [2021] and conduct a new experiment to evaluate
the offensiveness and harmfulness of our personas using the RealToxicityPrompts dataset (Gehman
et al. [2020]) on our LEA models. The results are in the table 18. The values in the table above
represent the success rates (higher is better) for each bias metric, persona, and LEA model (GPT3.5
and Claude). Scores labeled "None" are consistently lower than those for all personas, indicating
that our personas do not increase offensiveness or harmfulness in conversations.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count
towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .
• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.
• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",
• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.
• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Abstract is adapted from introduction and conclusions.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See our limit Section A

22


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No such theories.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include details in the papers and also in the appendix for reprodicibility.
We do have to warn that some of the closed models might be deprecated at the time of
publications.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

23


---Page Break---
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes. Code and data are publicly available as shown in the first page footnotes.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We specify all such details in the paper and appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our related work in LLM evaluations usually do not report error bars or
standard deviations.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We specified in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

25


---Page Break---
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We do conform with above code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Evaluation works bear little risk for negative societal impacts. We acknowledge
that a potential bias issue could arise from LLM’s self-enhancement behaviors when acting
as evaluators. We made efforts to show this bias should have limited impacts on the results
and our claims are in Section 6.4, Appendix E, and Appendix G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

26


---Page Break---
Justification: Our work is not at risk for misuse.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Included throughout.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Included in the appendix and the supplmental data.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

27


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Not used.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No human participants involved.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
