Abstract

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning that seeks
to identify abnormal samples. Traditionally, unsupervised methods utilize a deep
generative model for OOD detection. However, such approaches require a new
model to be trained for each inlier dataset. This paper explores whether a single
model can perform OOD detection across diverse tasks. To that end, we introduce
Diffusion Paths (DiffPath), which uses a single diffusion model originally trained
to perform unconditional generation for OOD detection. We introduce a novel
technique of measuring the rate-of-change and curvature of the diffusion paths
connecting samples to the standard normal. Extensive experiments show that with
a single model, DiffPath is competitive with prior work using individual models
on a variety of OOD tasks involving different distributions. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/clear-nus/diffpath.

Introduction

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, also known as anomaly or outlier detection, seeks to detect
abnormal samples that are far from a given distribution. This is a vital problem as deep neural
networks are known to be overconfident when making incorrect predictions on outlier samples [1, 2],
leading to potential issues in safety-critical applications such as robotics, healthcare, finance, and
criminal justice [3]. Traditionally, OOD detection using only unlabeled data relies on training a
generative model on in-distribution data. Thereafter, measures such as model likelihood or its variants
are used as an OOD detection score [4–6]. An alternative approach is to utilize the excellent sampling
capabilities of diffusion models (DMs) to reconstruct corrupted samples, and use the reconstruction
loss as an OOD measure [7–9].

However, these conventional methods require separate generative models tailored to specific inlier
distributions and require retraining if the inlier data changes, such as in continual learning setups.
This prompts the question: can OOD detection be performed using a single generative model? We
answer in the affirmative and present Diffusion Paths (DiffPath) in this paper. While the use of a
single model for OOD detection has been proposed in the discriminative setting [10], to the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to explore this for generative models. We believe that the generative
setting is particularly salient in light of recent trends where single generative foundation models are
utilized across various tasks [11, 12].

Our method utilizes a single pretrained DM. In a departure from prior works that uti-
lize variants of likelihoods [6, 5, 4] or reconstruction losses [7–9], we propose to per-
form OOD detection by measuring characteristics of the forward diffusion trajectory, specif-
ically its rate-of-change and curvature, which can be computed from the score predicted
by the diffusion model.
We provide theoretical and empirical analyses that motivate these

quantities as useful OOD detectors;
their magnitudes are similar for samples from the
same distribution and different otherwise.
We summarize our contributions as follows:

with baselines that necessitates sepa-
rate models for each distribution.

Background

Score-based Diffusion Models.
Let p0(x) denote the data distribution. We define a stochastic
differential equation (SDE), also known as the forward process, to diffuse p0(x) to a noise distribution
pT (x):
dxt = f(xt, t)dt + g(t)dwt,
x0 ∼p0(x)
(1)

where f(·, t) : RD →RD is the drift coefficient, g(t) ∈R is the diffusion coefficient and wt ∈RD
is the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We denote pt as the marginal distribution of Eq. 1
at time t. By starting from noise samples xT ∼pT , new samples x0 ∼p0(x) can be sampled by
simulating the reverse SDE

dxt = [f(xt, t) −g(t)2∇x log pt(xt)]dt + g(t)d ¯wt,
xT ∼pT (x)
(2)

where ¯wt is the standard Wiener process when time flows backwards from T to 0, and dt is an
infinitesimal negative timestep. The diffusion process described by Eq. 1 also has an equivalent ODE
formulation, termed the probability flow (PF) ODE [13], given by

dxt =

f(xt, t) −1

2g(t)2∇x log pt(xt)

dt.
(3)

The ODE and SDE formulations are equivalent in the sense that trajectories under both processes share
the same marginal distribution pt(xt). Hence, given an estimate of the score function sθ(xt, t) ≈
∇x log pt(xt), which can be obtained using score-matching approaches [14, 13], one can sample
from the diffusion model by solving the reverse SDE or integrating the PF ODE backwards in time.

In this work, we focus on the variance-preserving formulation used in DDPM [15], which is given by
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward process

dxt = −1

2βtxtdt +
p

βtdwt,
x0 ∼p0(x)
(4)

where βt are time-dependent constants. Under Eq. 4, diffused samples xt can be sampled analytically
via pt(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯αtx0, σ2
t I), where βt = −d

dt log ¯αt and σ2
t = 1 −¯αt. The score estimator,
ϵθ(xt, t) ≈−σt∇x log pt(xt), can be trained via the following objective

Unsupervised OOD Detection.
Given a distribution of interest p(x), the goal of OOD detection is
to construct a scoring function which outputs a quantity Sθ(x) ∈R that identifies if a given test point
xtest is from p(x). In this work, a higher value of Sθ(xtest) indicates that the sample is more likely to
be drawn from p(x). We will use the notation “A vs B” to denote the task of distinguishing samples
between A and B, where A is the inlier distribution and B is the outlier distribution. In unsupervised
OOD detection, one must construct the function Sθ using only knowledge of A.

Diffusion Models for OOD Detection

An overview of our method, DiffPath, is illustrated in Fig. 1. DiffPath is based on the insight that
the rate-of-change and curvature of the diffusion path connecting samples to standard normal differ
between distributions, making them effective indicators for OOD detection. This section outlines the
methodology behind DiffPath. We begin in Sec. 3.1, where we provide evidence that likelihoods from
a diffusion model are insufficient for OOD detection. Next, Sec. 3.2 shows that the score function
is a measure of the rate-of-change and motivates the use of a single generative model. We then
motivate the curvature as the derivative of the score in Sec. 3.3. We consider the curvature statistic
as one variation of our method and abbreviate it as DiffPath-1D. In Sec. 3.4, we contextualize our
method in terms of the optimal transport path between samples and standard normal, and finally
propose a higher-order, hybrid variation called DiffPath-6D in Sec. 3.5, which incorporates both the
rate-of-change and curvature quantities.

3.1
Diffusion Model Likelihoods Do Not Work for OOD Detection

When leveraging a likelihood-based generative model for OOD detection, the most natural statistic to
consider is the likelihood itself. As DMs are trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
the data, one would expect that in-distribution samples have higher ELBO under the model compared
to out-of-distribution samples. However, prior works [2, 16] have shown that the opposite behavior
was observed in deep generative models, such as normalizing flows, where the model assigned higher
likelihoods to OOD samples.

In Fig. 2, we plot the distributions of the negative ELBO (denoted NLL) of the CIFAR10 and SVHN
training sets for a DM trained on CIFAR10. Our results corroborate earlier findings that likelihoods
are not good OOD detectors; the NLL of CIFAR10 samples are higher than SVHN samples, meaning
in-distribution samples have lower likelihoods than out-of-distribution samples. The poor AUROC
score in Table 1 quantitatively demonstrates the inability of likelihoods to distinguish between inlier
and outlier samples. This motivates us to search for better statistics that we can extract from DMs for
OOD detection.

3.2
Scores as an OOD Statistic

Scores as KL Divergence Proxy.
We start by rewriting the PF ODE, Eq. 3, in the following form:

dxt

dt = f(xt, t) + g(t)2

2σt
ϵp(xt, t)
(6)

Figure 3: Illustration of the forward integration of Eq. 7 on samples from CIFAR10, SVHN and
CelebA. Both the ImageNet and CelebA models are able bring the samples approximately to standard
normal. Other than the case where the CelebA model is used to integrate CelebA samples (last row
of the right figure), the samples shown here have not been seen by the models during training. While
in certain cases the end result appears to contain features of the original image, thus deviating from
an isotropic Gaussian (e.g., first row of the right figure), empirically we find that the scores remain
accurate enough for outlier detection; see Sec. 5 for quantitative results.

where we have parameterized the score as ϵp(xt, t) = −σt∇x log pt(x).

Theorem 1. Denote ϕt and ψt as the marginals from evolving two distinct distributions ϕ0 and
ψ0 via their respective probability flow ODEs (Eq. 6) forward in time. We consider the case with
the same forward process, i.e., the two PF ODEs have the same f(xt, t), g(t) and σt. Under some
regularity conditions stated in Appendix A.1,

DKL(ϕ0∥ψ0) = 1

∥ϵϕ(xt, t) −ϵψ(xt, t)∥2
2 dt + DKL(ϕT ∥ψT ).

The term DKL(ϕT ∥ψT ) vanishes as ϕT = ψT = N(0, I) by construction, assuming the true scores
are available. In practice, we rely on a score estimator ϵθ obtained via score matching approaches.
Theorem 1 suggests that the scores of the marginal distributions along the ODE path serve as a proxy
for the KL divergence: as DKL(ϕ0∥ψ0) increases, so should the difference in the norms of their
scores. Another interpretation is that this difference, E[∥ϵϕ(xt, t) −ϵψ(xt, t)∥2
2], is a measure of the
Fisher divergence between the two distributions, which forms the foundation for score matching [17].
This motivates using the norm of the scores as a statistic for distinguishing two distributions.

However, Theorem 1 is not immediately useful as it requires a priori knowledge of both distributions,
whereas in unsupervised OOD detection, only knowledge of the inlier distribution is available.
Interestingly, we empirically observe that it is possible to approximate the forward probability flow
ODE for different distributions using a single diffusion model. Recall that as the PF ODE has the
same marginal as the forward SDE, if the score estimate ϵθ has converged to the true score, then
forward integration of a sample x0 using Eq. 6 should bring the sample to approximately standard
normal, xT ∼N(0, I).

Specifically, we consider the following parameterization [18] of the PF ODE

d¯xt = ϵθ(xt, t)dγt
(7)

where γt =
q

1−¯α2

and ¯xt = xt

t . Let ϵθ(xt, t) = −σt∇x log pt(x) be a score model
trained on p0(x). It is known that the DDIM sampler [19] is Euler’s method applied to Eq. 7. In Fig.
3, we integrate Eq. 7 forward in time using DDIM for samples from various distributions, most of
which are unseen by the model during training. Qualitatively, we observe the surprising fact that both
the ImageNet and CelebA models are able to bring the samples approximately to the standard normal.
We ablate the choice of p0 in Sec. 5.2.

This motivates ϵθ as a replacement for arbitrary ϵϕ when integrating Eq. 7 forward with samples

from ϕ0. In Fig. 2, we see that the distributions of

qP

t ∥ϵθ(xt, t)∥2
2, the square root of the sum of L2

norms of scores over time, applied to the two datasets using a single model trained on ImageNet are
better separated than the likelihoods. Note that Theorem 1 tells us only that the score norms of inlier
and outlier samples are different, not whether one is higher or lower than the other. Thus, we propose
the following OOD detection scheme: fit a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to

qP

t ∥ϵθ(xt, t)∥2
2 of the
training set for a given distribution, then use the KDE likelihoods of a test sample as the OOD score

Sθ. This way, the likelihoods of outlier samples under the KDE are lower than for inlier samples,
allowing us to compute the AUROC. We provide pseudocode in Algorithm 1. With this scheme, the
AUROC scores in Table 1 show a large improvement over likelihoods; however, we would like to
pursue even better OOD statistics, which we discuss in Sec. 3.3.

Score as First-Order Taylor Expansion.
We provide a second interpretation of the score, and
subsequently motivate a new statistic that can be used for OOD detection. Recall that the numerical
DDIM solver is the first-order Euler’s method applied to Eq. 7. In general, we can expand the ODE
to higher-order terms using the truncated Taylor method [20, 18]:

where hn = γtn+1 −γtn. The norm of the first-order score, ∥ϵθ∥2, therefore measures the rate-of-
change of the ODE integration path. Intuitively, the ODE integration path necessary to bring different
distributions to the standard normal in finite time differs (c.f. the PF ODE path is also the optimal
transport path, see Sec. 3.4) , hence the rate-of-change differs as well.

3.3
Second-Order Taylor Expansion (DiffPath-1D)

Based on the preceding discussion, it is natural to consider if higher-order terms in the ODE Taylor
expansion can also serve as an effective OOD statistic. We answer in the affirmative by considering
the second order term, dϵθ

dγt . Intuitively, the second-order term measures the curvature of the ODE
integration path. We expand the derivative as follows [18]:

dϵθ
dγt

We see that the derivative contains two Jacobian-Vector Products (JVP) and a simple time derivative
term. In principle, all three terms can be computed using automatic differentiation. However, this
makes inference twice as costly due to the need for an additional backward pass after every forward
pass of the network, and significantly more memory-intensive due to storage of the full computation
graph. Fortunately, the time derivative term can be computed using simple finite difference:

∂ϵθ(xt, t)

∂t
≈ϵθ(xt+∆t, t + ∆t) −ϵθ(xt, t)

∆t
(10)

where the pairs (xt, xt+∆t) are obtained during standard DDIM integration. Thus, no additional
costs associated with gradient computation are incurred.

Surprisingly, we observe that for high-dimensional distributions such as images that we consider
in this work, the time derivative in Eq. 10 alone provides an accurate enough estimate for OOD

detection. Using the same ImageNet model as in Sec. 3.2, we observe an improvement in AUROC
scores in CIFAR10 vs SVHN in Table 1 when using the second-order statistic. Qualitatively, the
distributions of

qP

t ∥∂tϵθ(xt, t)∥2
2 are more spread out in Fig. 2 as compared to the first-order scores,
although the distinction is subtle; the quantitative results provide a more reliable confirmation of the
benefit of using the second-order statistic.

We thus consider the second-order statistic alone,

qP

t ∥∂tϵθ(xt, t)∥2
2, as a possible statistic for OOD
detection. As it is a one-dimensional quantity, we abbreviate it as DiffPath-1D. We evaluate DiffPath-
1D in Sec. 5.2.

3.4
Connections to Optimal Transport

Recent works have viewed DDIM integration as an encoder that maps the data distribution to standard
normal [21, 22]. They prove that this map is the optimal transport (OT) path if the data distribution
is Gaussian, while providing numerical results suggesting likewise for high-dimensional data like
images. As a result, we can view the OOD statistics proposed in Sec. 3.2 and Sec. 3.3 as characterizing
different derivatives of the OT path: the score ∥ϵθ∥2 represents the rate-of-change of the path, while
the time derivative ∥∂tϵθ∥2 represents its curvature.

To justify our proposition that derivatives of OT paths serve as meaningful OOD statistics, we consider
the following toy example [21] of distinguishing two multivariate Gaussians (detailed derivation in
Appendix A.2). Let the distributions be pi
0(x) ∼N(ai, I), i ∈{0, 1}, where ai ∈Rd and I ∈Rd×d.
The marginal densities along the forward diffusion can be computed exactly using the transition
formulas for SDEs [23] and is given by pi
t(x) ∼N(aie−t, I), with PF ODE dxi

dt = −aie−t. This
path corresponds exactly to the OT map between pi
0 and N(0, I). In this case, the corresponding first

and second-order OOD statistics are equal and given by
 dxi

dt

2 =
 d2xi

dt2

2 = ∥aie−t∥2. Crucially,

they are proportional to ∥ai∥2, meaning that as the two distributions move farther apart (i.e., as
∥a0 −a1∥2 increases), so should the L2 norms of the OOD statistics, thereby increasing their ability
to distinguish samples between the two.

Owing to its simplicity, the one-dimensional statistic proposed in Sec. 3.3 may
suffer from edge cases or perform suboptimally as information is condensed
to a single scalar. For instance, given an image x0 with pixels normalized to
the range [−1, 1], one such edge case is distinguishing x0 from itself with the
sign of the pixels flipped, −x0. The two samples will produce symmetric OT
paths differing only by a negative sign, resulting in identical statistics after
taking the L2 norm. We can see this from Table 2 where DiffPath-1D fails
to distinguish CIFAR10 samples from itself with signs flipped, which we call
negative CIFAR10. As such, we propose a higher-dimensional statistic that
does not utilize the standard form of the Lp norm: ∥x∥p = P

i |xi|p. We define a new scalar quantity,
⟨x⟩p = P

i(xi)p, which retains the sign information, and propose a new six-dimensional statistic we
dub DiffPath-6D:

h P
t⟨ϵθ(xt, t)⟩1, P
t⟨ϵθ(xt, t)⟩2, P
t⟨ϵθ(xt, t)⟩3, P
t⟨∂tϵθ(xt, t)⟩1, P
t⟨∂tϵθ(xt, t)⟩2, P
t⟨∂tϵθ(xt, t)⟩3
i⊤

which concatenates scalars based on the first, second and third powers of ϵθ and ∂tϵθ into a vector.
From Table 2, DiffPath-6D is able to distinguish CIFAR10 from neg. CIFAR10 near perfectly. We
validate both DiffPath-1D and DiffPath-6D on a wider suite of experiments in Sec. 5.

Related Works

Modern OOD detection can be divided roughly into three categories: feature-based, likelihood-based,
reconstruction-based. Feature-based methods extract features from inlier samples and fit a likelihood
or distance function as an OOD detector. For instance, one can obtain the latent representations of
a test sample using an autoencoder and measure its Mahalanobis distance to the representations of
inlier samples [24]. Distances between features derived from self-supervised learning models are

6


---Page Break---
also utilized in similar contexts [25, 26]. Similar to our work, Xiao et al. [10] showed that one can
perform OOD detection using features from a single discriminative model.

Likelihood-based approaches leverage a generative model trained on inlier samples. These methods
typically employ variants of the log-likelihood of a test sample under the model as the OOD detection
score. Nalisnick et al. [2] first pointed out that deep generative models might erroneously assign
higher likelihoods to outlier samples. Several explanations have been proposed, such as the input
complexity [16] and typicality [27] of samples. As a result, just as we show in Sec. 3.1, vanilla
likelihoods are rarely used. Instead, variants derived from the log-likelihood have been proposed,
such as likelihood ratios [4], ensembles of the likelihood [5], density of states [6], energy-based
models [28] and typicality tests [27]. Diffusion Time Estimation [29] estimates the distribution over
the diffusion time of a noisy test sample and uses the mean or mode as the OOD score. MSMA [30]
uses the score function over discrete noise levels for OOD detection. One can view MSMA as a
specific case of DiffPath which only utilizes the first-order statistic, while we generalize to higher-
order terms. MSMA proposes to measure the score at various noise levels, while our method sums
over the entire diffusion path. It is worth emphasizing that MSMA requires different models for
different inlier distributions, unlike our single model setup.

Reconstruction-based approaches evaluate how well a generative model, trained on in-distribution
data, can reconstruct a test sample. Earlier works utilize autoencoders [31] and GANs [32] for
reconstruction. Recent works have adapted unconditional DMs to this approach due to its impressive
sample quality. A test sample is first artificially corrupted before being reconstructed using the DM’s
sampling process. DDPM-OOD [7] noises a sample using the forward process and evaluates the
perceptual quality [33] of the reconstructed sample. Projection Regret [9] adopts a similar approach,
but uses a Consistency Model [34] and introduces an additional projection regret score. LMD [8]
corrupts the image by masking and reconstructs the sample via inpainting. Evidently, DiffPath differs
from these diffusion approaches as we do not utilize reconstructions. We also stress again that these
baselines require different models for different inlier tasks.

Experiments

Based on our earlier analysis, we hypothesize that DiffPath can be utilized for OOD detection across
diverse tasks using a single model. In this section, we validate our hypothesis with comprehensive
experiments across numerous pairwise OOD detection tasks and compare DiffPath’s performance
against state-of-the-art baselines.

Datasets.
All experiments are conducted as of pairwise OOD detection tasks using CIFAR10 (C10),
SVHN, and CelebA as inlier datasets, and CIFAR100 (C100) and Textures as additional outlier
datasets. Unconditional diffusion models are employed at resolutions of 32 × 32 and 64 × 64. The
model utilizing ImageNet as the base distribution is trained at 64 × 64 resolution, while all other
models are trained at 32 × 32.

Methodology and Baselines.
Our methodology features two variants of our model, DiffPath-1D
using KDE and DiffPath-6D using a Gaussian Mixture Model for OOD scoring, as outlined in Sec. 3.
We compare against a variety of generative baselines, including Energy-based Model (EBM) such as
IGEBM [28], VAEBM [35] and Improved CD [36], as well as Input Complexity (IC) [16], Density
of States (DOS) [6], Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) [5], Typicality Test (TT) [27]
and Likelihood Ratio (LR) [4] applied to the Glow [37] model. Additionally, we compare against
diffusion baselines such as vanilla NLL and IC based on the DM’s likelihoods and re-implementations
of DDPM-OOD [7], LMD [8], and MSMA [30] based on open-source code for full comparisons.

Main Results

Table 3 summarizes our main results. Here, we report outcomes for DiffPath-6D using ImageNet and
CelebA as base distributions. DiffPath-6D-CelebA achieves an average AUROC of 0.931, comparable
to the leading diffusion-based approach MSMA and outperforming all other baselines, while utilizing

other diffusion baselines that require an order of magnitude or more NFEs. When using ImageNet as

magnitudes more NFEs due to multiple reconstructions. This is despite the ImageNet model never
having seen any samples from the evaluated distributions during training.

The empirical results indicate that the CelebA-based model outperforms the ImageNet-based model
primarily due to its superior performance on tasks involving CelebA samples, whether they are
in-distribution or out-of-distribution. For instance, DiffPath-6D-CelebA achieves near-perfect per-
formance on all tasks where CelebA is in-distribution (rightmost columns), and in the CIFAR10
vs CelebA task. On tasks that do not involve CelebA samples, the two models exhibit roughly
comparable performance. This suggests that distinguishing CelebA from other samples is particularly
challenging, and that DiffPath benefits from exposure to inlier samples from the respective distribu-
tions during training. Next, we discuss the effect of the base datasets and other design considerations
via ablations.

Ablations

Choice of Diffusion Training Set.
We investigate the impact of the base dataset on the performance
of DiffPath-6D. In Table 4, we compare four different base distributions alongside a randomly
initialized model. As a baseline check, we observe that the average AUROC of the randomly
initialized model is 0.501, which is consistent with random guessing. This indicates that training on a
base distribution is essential for the model to learn features for effective OOD detection.

Our ablations include CIFAR10 and SVHN as base distributions, in addition to CelebA and ImageNet
shown in Table 3. Among these four base distributions, CelebA yields the best performance overall.
Notably, the models trained on SVHN and CelebA demonstrate superior results when the inlier
data aligns with their respective training distributions. This supports the established principle of
training models on in-distribution samples, and we show that DiffPath-6D similarly benefits from
such training. However, we underscore the key finding of our work: while in-distribution training
enhances performance, it is not strictly necessary. DiffPath-6D exhibits strong performance even on
tasks involving samples from distributions that the model has not encountered during training.

DiffPath 1D vs 6D.
Here we ablate on the choice of DiffPath-1D and DiffPath-6D. Table 6 shows
that DiffPath-6D performs better than its 1D counterpart for both choices of base distributions. We
attribute this to the increased robustness of aggregating multiple statistics, c.f. Sec. 3.5, and recom-
mend practitioners to use DiffPath-6D in general. However, DiffPath-1D outperforms DiffPath-6D in
certain instances. For instance, for the ImageNet model, DiffPath-1D achieves the best performance
on CIFAR10 vs SVHN and in three out of four tasks where SVHN is the inlier distribution.

Number of DDIM Steps.
We investigate how the performance of our method varies with the
number of NFEs (DDIM steps) in Table 5. Overall, the changes in average AUROC are relatively
minor as the NFEs are varied, suggesting that DiffPath is robust to the number of integration steps. The
best result is obtained at 10 NFEs. While the finite difference approximation of the derivative (Eq. 10)
should become more accurate as the number of NFEs increases, the aggregation of multiple statistics
involving scores and its derivatives makes this effect less pronounced. We leave the investigation of
this phenomena in greater detail to future work.

5.3
Proper Image Resizing with a Single Model

Using a single DM with a fixed input resolution necessitates resizing all images to match the model’s
resolution during evaluation. However, when datasets have differing original resolutions, naive
resizing—upsampling lower-resolution images and downsampling higher-resolution ones—can lead

to evaluation inaccuracies. Specifically, upsampling introduces blurriness due to pixel interpolation,
while downsampling does not. This discrepancy allows the model to differentiate samples based on
image blur rather than semantic content, resulting in overly optimistic performance metrics.

For instance, when evaluating DiffPath-6D trained at 64 × 64 pixels on the CelebA vs CIFAR10 task,
CIFAR10 images are upsampled (introducing blur) while CelebA images are downsampled. This
imbalance enables trivial distinction between the samples. As illustrated in the first row of Table 7,
tasks where only one distribution undergoes upsampling yield artificially high AUROC scores.

To mitigate this issue, we propose equalizing the resizing process by first downsampling higher-
resolution images to the lower resolution of the other distribution, then upsampling both to the model’s
required resolution. In the CelebA vs CIFAR10 example, CelebA images are downsampled to 32×32
pixels before both samples are upsampled to 64 × 64 pixels. This method ensures consistent blurring
effects across all samples, reducing confounding factors. The second row of Table 7 demonstrates
more accurate evaluations using this approach. We adopt this resizing procedure in all relevant
experiments to ensure fair comparisons. In short, we highlight the importance of consistent image
resizing for fair evaluation in OOD detection, which we hope will guide future research.

5.4
Near-OOD Tasks

Near-OOD tasks refer to setups where the inlier and outlier samples are semantically similar, making
them challenging for most methods. From Table 3, DiffPath, like most baselines, does not perform
strongly on near-OOD tasks like CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100. This motivated us to conduct further
near-OOD experiments, the results of which are presented in Table 8 of Sec. C of the appendix. Note
that near-OOD tasks are not a standard evaluation on generative methods. We defer detailed analysis
of the results to the appendix, and leave further investigations on near-OOD tasks to future work.

Conclusion

In this work, we proposed Diffusion Paths (DiffPath), a method of OOD detection using a single
diffusion model by characterizing properties of the forward diffusion path. In light of the growing
popularity of generative foundation models, our work demonstrates that a single diffusion model can
also be applied to OOD detection. There are several interesting future directions that arise from our
work; for instance, applying DiffPath to other modalities such as video, audio, language, time series
and tabular data, as well as investigating if higher-order terms of the Taylor expansion, or leveraging
different instantiations of the PF ODE might lead to better performance.

Limitations and Future Work.
We only calculate the simple time derivative and found that it
works well experimentally, although one might compute the full derivative to quantify the curvature
completely. We leave this for future work. Also, we consider DMs trained on natural images like
CelebA and ImageNet, which may not be appropriate for specialized applications such as medical
images. For such purposes, one could consider including domain-specific data during training.

Proofs

A.1
Theorem 1

Theorem 1. Denote ϕt and ψt as the marginals from evolving two distinct distributions ϕ0 and
ψ0 via their respective probability flow ODEs (Eq. 6) forward in time. We consider the case with
the same forward process, i.e., the two PF ODEs have the same f(xt, t), g(t) and σt. Under some
regularity conditions stated in Appendix A.1,

DKL(ϕ0∥ψ0) = 1

2 dt + DKL(ϕT ∥ψT ).

Proof. The proof is a modification from Song et al. [38]. Let us first state the PF ODEs of the two
distributions explicitly:
dxt

dt = f(xt, t) + g(t)2

2σt
ϵϕ(xt, t),
ϵϕ(xt, t) = −σt∇x log ϕt(x)
(11)

dxt

dt = f(xt, t) + g(t)2

2σt
ϵψ(xt, t),
ϵψ(xt, t) = −σt∇x log ψt(x).
(12)

We make the following assumption about ϕt and ψt:

∀t ∈[0, T], ∃k > 0 s.t. ϕt(x) = O(e−∥x∥k
2), ψt(x) = O(e−∥x∥k
2) as ∥x∥2 →∞.
(13)

We start by rewriting the KL divergence between ϕ0 and ψ0 in integral form:
DKL(ϕ0∥ψ0) = DKL(ϕ0∥ψ0) −DKL(ϕT ∥ψT ) + DKL(ϕT ∥ψT )

= −
Z T

0

∂DKL(ϕt∥ψt)

∂t
dt + DKL(ϕT ∥ψT ).
(14)

As we can treat the PF ODE as a special case of an SDE with zero diffusion term, we can obtain the
Fokker-Planck of the marginal density of the PF ODEs, also known as the continuity equation, as
follows:
∂ϕt

∂t = ∇x ·

−f(xt, t)ϕt(x) −g(t)2

2σt
ϵϕ(xt, t)ϕt(x)

= ∇x · (hϕϕt(x))
(15)

where we define hϕ := −f(xt, t) −g(t)2

2σt ϵϕ(xt, t) for simplicity. Similarly, ∂ψt

∂t = ∇x · (hψψt(x)).

Let us now rewrite the time-derivative ∂DKL(ϕt∥ψt)

∂t
in Eq. 14 as follows:
∂DKL(ϕt∥ψt)

∂t
= ∂

limx→∞hψ(x, t)ψt(x) = 0 due to assumption 13. Combining with Eq. 14 gives us the desired

A.2
OT Toy Example

We derive here in detail the toy example discussed in Sec. 3.4, where we will prove the optimal
transport map between a multivariate Gaussian and standard normal is identical to the diffusion PF
ODE path. We consider our source distribution as p0(x) ∼N(a, I), a ∈Rd and I ∈Rd×d. We
choose our forward SDE to be parameterized as:

dxt = −xdt +
√

2dwt,
(17)

which is the same Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as the DDPM forward SDE Eq. 4 with a constant
noise schedule β(t) = 2. This is also commonly referred to as the Langevin equation.

As Eq. 17 has affine drift coefficients and a starting distribution which is normal, we know that the
marginal distributions at intermediate times are also normal, pt(x) ∼N(µ(t), Σ(t)). Furthermore,
we can calculate the means and variances analytically using Eq. 5.50 and Eq. 5.51 of Särkkä and
Solin [23]:

dµ(t)

dt
= −µ(t),
dΣ(t)

dt
= −2Σ(t) + 2
(18)

with solutions

µ(t) = µ(0)e−t = ae−t,
Σ(t) = I + e−2t(Σ(0) −I) = I.
(19)

Thus, the marginal density has the form pt(x) = N(ae−t, I), from which we compute the score as
∇x log pt(x) = −x + ae−t. We can substitute this into the corresponding PF ODE to obtain:

dxt

dt = −x −∇x log pt(x)

= −ae−t.
(20)

The optimal transport map denoted Ep0(x) is obtained by solving Eq. 20 to get xt = x0 + a(e−t −I)
and taking the limit t →∞. This gives us Ep0(x) = x −a, which is precisely the OT map between
p0(x) ∼N(a, I) and N(0, I) (cf. Eq. 2.40 in Peyré and Cuturi [39]).

B
Experimental Details

DiffPath.
As mentioned in Sec. 5, we utilize a single unconditional diffusion model trained on
CelebA and ImageNet at 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 resolution respectively. We train our own CelebA
model and utilize the ImageNet checkpoint trained using Improved DDPM’s Lhybrid objective (Eq. 16
of Nichol and Dhariwal [40]) from the official repository2. Both models use a cosine noise schedule
with a total of 4000 diffusion steps. For DiffPath-1D, we fit a KDE using a Gaussian kernel with a
bandwith of 5. For DiffPath-6D, we fit a GMM with hyperparameters obtained by sweeping over a
predefined number of mixture components (e.g., 50, 100) and covariance type (e.g., diagonal, full,
tied). Both are implemented using the sklearn library.

On a single Nvidia A5000 GPU, DiffPath takes approximately 0.25s and 0.94s per integration step
on 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 images respectively with a batch size of 256.

Diffusion Baselines.
For all diffusion baselines, we rely on the official GitHub repositories and
open-source checkpoints where possible. The repositories are listed as follows: MSMA3, DDPM-
OOD4, LMD5. For NLL and IC, we use the pre-trained CIFAR10 checkpoint from Improved DDPM
and train our own model for SVHN using the same hyperparameters at 32 × 32 resolution. We
calculate the NLL using the default implementation in Improved DDPM, while we compute IC using
code from the LR repository6 due to lack of official code from the IC authors. We train all baselines
using 1-3 A5000 GPUs.

Near-OOD Results

To further investigate the performance of DiffPath on near-OOD tasks, we ran experiments on two
tasks proposed in OpenOOD [41]. The first task involves CIFAR10 as the in-distribution data with
CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet (also known as ImageNet200) as out-of-distribution datasets. The
second involves TinyImageNet as in-distribution data and SSB [42] (hard split) and NINCO [43] as
out-of-distribution data (see the official repository7 for full details).

We compare our results against the four latest discriminative baselines reported in OpenOOD [41]
under the “w/o Extra Data, w/o Training" category, which are KLM [44], VIM [45], KNN [46] and
DICE [47]. We report the average AUROC of each task in Table 8. The results are mixed: DiffPath
performs the best for the TinyImageNet task, but obtains the poorest result for the CIFAR10 task.

As noted in the main text, to our knowledge near-OOD tasks are not a standard evaluation setup for
generative methods. We hypothesize that such tasks are better suited to discriminative methods as
gradient-based classification training enables the model to learn fine-grained features specific to each
in-distribution class, which we believe is crucial in this context. In contrast, generative models focus
on maximizing the likelihood of the overall data distribution and are not explicitly trained to identify
subtle discriminative features. This could potentially lead to weaker performance in tasks where the
distributions exhibit a high degree of overlap. It should be noted that discriminative methods typically
require class labels, while unconditional generative methods do not, thus constraining the use of the
former to cases with labelled in-distribution data.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Framework proposed in the introduction is thoroughly discussed in the methods
section. Experimental results support the claim that we are competitive with baselines.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include a limitations section in the conclusion.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: Complete proofs for Theorem 1 and the optimal transport example are provided
in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Full experimental details are provided in main paper and appendix. Open-
source code is provided.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Open-source code is provided.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Provided in the appendix and code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not conventionally reported for AUROC performance. Further-
more, our method is deterministic (ODE-based), so repeated evaluations produce the same
result (up to initialization of the EM algorithm when fitting the GMM, which is negligible
in our experiments).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

19


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Provided in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We believe the research conforms to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: While we utilize a diffusion model, we are not leveraging its generation
abilities, so societal impacts of generative models like bias/disinformation/deepfakes etc are
not relevant to our work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

20


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The diffusion models utilized in this work are trained on standardized, publicly
available image datasets (e.g., CelebA, ImageNet) that to our knowledge, do not contain
risks of misuse or harmful generation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Citations to relevant models and works are given.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Documentation is provided in the appendix and open-source code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No human subjects are required in this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No human subjects or crowdsourcing are required in this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
