Abstract

The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their
vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them
to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these
models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investi-
gation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated
components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention
head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model
to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific
knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have al-
lowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer
Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we
evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge
circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these
editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and inter-
pret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We
believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of
Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing1.

Introduction

“Knowledge is power, and when embodied in the form of new technical inventions and mechanical
discoveries it is the force that drives history.” [1, 2], Bacon’s words are vividly re-enacted in the
era of Large Language Models (LLMs) [3, 4], as we witness their immense power in reshaping
human society and redefining our understanding of machine intelligence. One thing that cannot be
denied is that knowledge encapsulated within these models empowers their capabilities in reasoning,
perceiving the world, and engaging in human-like communication. Nevertheless, these powerful
models are not without their flaws. They still struggle with issues such as hallucinations [5–7], unsafe
norms [8, 9], and offensive behaviors [10, 11] and these problems are exacerbated by the enigmatic
internal mechanisms of knowledge storage within language models.

Recently, the research community has devoted significant efforts to unraveling the knowledge storage
mechanisms of these models. Various studies [12–19] have been conducted to shed light on this
intricate process, aiming to enhance our understanding and improve the safety and reliability of
language models. The main finding in previous work is that knowledge may primarily stored in the
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) of Transformer-based language models. These MLPs function as
a key-value neural memory, with knowledge being stored in what are termed “knowledge neurons”
(KN). Based on these findings, researchers conduct Knowledge Editing [18, 20] to update the
language models’ inaccurate facts, bias and unsafe content in their parametric space. Despite the

initial success of these methods, there are still limitations, such as poor generalization, severe side
effects, and failure to effectively utilize edited knowledge [20, 21], which motivate us to re-think
previous approaches for interpreting knowledge storage in language models. Note that previous
works treat the knowledge blocks as isolated components following the Restorative Theory [22], often
focusing on identifying the specific blocks that store particular knowledge. Several works [23, 24]
have proposed that different types of knowledge are often located in the same areas, suggesting that
the current KN thesis may be an oversimplification.

To this end, instead of solely pinpointing tiny regions where the knowledge expressed can be localized,
we aim to explore the cooperation between different components in Transformers like attention heads,
MLPs, and embeddings, to understand how the language model stores and expresses the knowledge.
Here, we introduce a new perspective: Knowledge Circuits, a critical subgraph in the language
model to view the knowledge mechanism of Transformers. Note that Circuit, as a subgraph in the
computation graph, has gained ever-growing attention in the mechanistic interpretability field [25].
Previous work [26, 27] has found several important circuits for specific tasks like Indirect Object
Identification and Color Object Identification. These tasks necessitate the model to search the
preceding context for a matching token and copy it into the next token prediction. In this work,
we aim to construct knowledge circuits that require the model to utilize stored knowledge for
making predictions. Our goal is to better unveil implicit neural knowledge representations, elucidate
the internal mechanisms for knowledge editing, and interpret more complex behaviors of language
models. Specifically, we leverage factual recall tasks and conduct experiments across various domains,
including factual, social bias, linguistic, and commonsense knowledge. We utilize GPT-2 [28] and
TinyLLAMA [29] to explore the potential knowledge representations and utilization mechanisms in
these models. As shown in Figure 1 (a), we construct knowledge circuits associated with various
expressions of knowledge using the existing knowledge stored in the language model. Through those
discovered knowledge circuits, we find many interesting phenomena and conclusions as follows:

Knowledge circuits unveil implicit neural knowledge representations. We find that even when the
knowledge circuits are used independently, the language model can recall related knowledge with a
significant portion of its overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of those discovered
knowledge representations (circuits). We also delve into specific pieces of knowledge and analyze
the information flow within their respective circuits, indicating that the language model tends to
aggregate knowledge in the earlier to middle layers and further enhances this information in the
later layers. We further uncover several special components (e.g., mover heads and relation heads)

in transferring information to the final token position and capturing relational information from the
context (Figure 1 (b)).

Knowledge circuits elucidate internal mechanisms for knowledge editing. We conduct experi-
ments to evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing methods on the language models’ original
knowledge circuits. Empirically, we observe that ROME [18] tends to incorporate edited information
primarily at the edited layer. Subsequent mover heads (Appendix B.2) then transport this information
to the residual stream of the last token. Conversely, during fine-tuning, the edited token is directly
integrated into the language model, exerting a dominant influence on subsequent predictions.

Knowledge circuits facilitate interpreting language model behaviors. We further utilize the
knowledge circuits to interpret language model behaviors, such as hallucination and in-context
learning. We observe that when hallucination occurs, the language model fails to correctly transfer
knowledge to the final token in the earlier layers. This is evident as the knowledge circuit lacks an
effective “mover” head, or the mover head selects incorrect information. Additionally, we notice that
several new attention heads emerge in the knowledge circuit during in-context learning.

Background: Circuit Theory

2.1
Preliminaries

In the context of neural network interpretability, a circuit can be conceptualized as a human-
interpretable subgraph that is dedicated to executing specific tasks within a neural network model
[30, 26, 31–33]. When we visualize a neural network model as a connected directed acyclic graph
(DAG), denoted as G, the individual nodes represent the various components involved in the forward
pass, such as neurons, attention heads, and embeddings. The edges symbolize the interactions
between these components, including residual connections, attention mechanisms, and projections. A
circuit, represented as C ⊆G, emerges as a significant subgraph of G that is responsible for particular
behaviors or functionalities. In this paper, we focus on the Transformer decoder architecture to
conduct our experiments. The residual stream of Transformers has been demonstrated to be a valuable
tool for mechanistic interpretability in recent works [25, 16]. The Transformer architecture typically
starts with token embeddings, followed by a sequence of “residual blocks” and concludes with a
token unembedding. Each residual block comprises an attention layer and an MLP layer, both of
which “read” their input from the residual stream (via a linear projection) and “write” their output
back to the residual stream through an additive projection. We can consider an attention head Al,j
(the jth attention head in layer l) as operating on the residual stream from the previous layer, Rl−1.
Given that R0 = I (where I represents the input embeddings), we can reinterpret attention head Al,j
as processing the cumulative output of all previous attention heads and MLPs and input embedding,
treating each node in the previous layers as separate input arguments. Similarly, an MLP node Ml
can be seen as operating on the cumulative output of all previous attention heads and MLPs and input
embedding, and the output node O operates on the sum of the input embeddings and the outputs
of all attention heads and MLPs. The following equations represent the residual connections in the
Transformer model, where Rl is the residual stream at layer l, and InputA
l and InputM
l
are the inputs
to the attention and MLP layers, respectively:

The computational graph G of the Transformer represents the interactions between attention heads and
MLPs. The nodes in G encompass the input embedding I, attention heads Al,j, MLPs Ml, and the
output node O, denoted as N = {I, Al,j, Ml, O}. The edges in the model represent the connections
between these nodes, E = {(nx, ny), nx, ny ∈N}. A circuit C is meticulously constructed to
govern specific behaviors within the model, comprising a selection of nodes NC and edges EC that
are critical to the successful execution of the tasks at hand, expressed as C =< NC, EC >.

Circuit Discovery

To identify circuits within a language model, a key approach is to examine the model’s casual
mediation by systematically altering the model’s edges and nodes to observe the effects on perfor-
mance [32, 34, 35]. The underlying principle is that critical edges or nodes are those whose removal
results in a notable decline in the model’s predictive capabilities. Since the edges in the model’s
computational graph represent the dependencies between nodes, we can simulate the absence of a
particular node-to-node dependency by ablating an edge in the graph. For example, ablating an edge
from Ai′,j′ to Ai,j involves replacing the contribution of Ai′,j′ in the input to attention head Ai,j
with zero (in the case of zero ablation) or with the mean value of head Ai′,j′ (in the case of mean
ablation). The process of identifying critical edges or nodes through ablation can be broken down
into the following steps: i) Overwrite the value of the edge (nx, ny) with a corrupted value (either
zero or mean ablation), ii) Perform a forward pass through the model with the altered graph, iii)
Compare the output values of the modified model with those of the original model using a chosen
metric S (Details in Eq.1 ). If the performance change is below a predefined threshold τ, we can
consider the edge non-critical and remove it to obtain a new subgraph G/(nx, ny). In addition to
ablation-based methods, recent works have also explored the use of sparse auto-encoders [36, 37] to
identify circuits within language models. This approach involves training an auto-encoder to learn a
sparse representation of the model’s internal structure, which can help reveal the underlying circuitry
responsible for specific behaviors or functionalities.

Knowledge Circuits Discovery in Transformers

3.1
Knowledge Circuits Construction

Unlike previous work [12, 18], which managed to find out the specific areas that store knowledge, we
pay extra heed to the information flow that activates subsequent knowledge for answering questions.
Similar to [38, 26], we write language model as a graph consisting of the input, the output, attention
heads, and MLPs by considering a “residual rewrite” of the model’s computational structure. For
example, this residual rewrite gives us a nearly-dense graph in GPT2-medium: one between every
pair of (attention head, MLP, input, and output) nodes, except for attention heads in the same layer,
which do not communicate with each other. In our paper, we concentrate on the task of answering
factual open-domain questions, where the goal is to predict a target entity o given a subject-relation
pair (s, r). A knowledge triplet k = (s, r, o) is often presented to the model in the form of a natural
language prompt for next token prediction (e.g., “The official language of France is ____”). The
model G is expected to generate the target entity, which is consistent with the language model’s
pretraining format. To identify the circuit that is critical for predicting the target entity o for a given
subject-relation pair (s, r), we ablate each special edge ei = (nx, ny) in the computation graph
G. We then measure the impact of ablating the edge (zero ablation in our implementation) on the
model’s performance using the MatchNLL loss [32] for the target o:

S(ei) = log(G(o|(s, r))) −log(G/ei(o|(s, r)))
(1)

If the score S(ei) is less than the predefined threshold τ, we consider the edge to be non-critical and
remove it from the computation graph, updating the temporary circuit Ctemp ←G/ei. We first sort
the graph by topological rank following Conmy et al. [32] and traverse all edges in this manner, We
derive a circuit Ck that contributes to representing the knowledge necessary to answer the factual
question:
Ck =< Nk, Ek >
(2)
Here, Ck is the circuit for the knowledge triplet k, consisting of the nodes Nk and edges Ek that are
essential for predicting the target entity o given the subject-relation pair (s, r).

3.2
Knowledge Circuits Information Analysis

Once we have identified the knowledge circuit, we delve deeper into the specific roles and behaviors
of each node and edge within the computation graph. Our goal is to comprehend the processing and
contribution of each node ni to the functionality of the circuit. Drawing on the methodologies of
previous studies [16, 39, 40], we begin by applying layer normalization to the output of each node ni
and then map it into the embedding space. This is achieved by multiplying the layer-normalized output
by the unembedding matrix (WU) of the language model: WU LN(ni). This transformation allows

4


---Page Break---
us to inspect how each component writes information to the circuit and how it influences subsequent
computational steps. By understanding the nodes’ behavior in the circuit, we can better comprehend
the circuit’s structure and the key points where information is aggregated and disseminated.

Knowledge Circuits Experimental Settings

Implementations.
We conduct experiments on GPT-style models, including GPT-2 medium and
large. We also conduct primary experiments on TinyLLaMA [29] to validate the effectiveness of
different architectures. We utilize the Automated Circuit Discovery [32] toolkit to build a circuit as an
initiative of our analysis and leverage transformer lens [41] to further analyze the results. Specifically,
we simply employ the MatchNLL [32] as the metric to detect the effect of the given node and edge
and use zero ablation to knock out the specific computation node in the model’s computation graph.

Metrics.
A discovered knowledge circuit is deemed an accurate representation of a specific area
within the transformer’s knowledge storage, thus, it should be capable of representing the knowledge
independently. Following [32], we leverage the completeness of a circuit, which refers to its ability
to independently reproduce the behavior or predictions of the full model for the relevant tasks. This
property is assessed by examining whether the identified subgraph corresponds to the underlying
algorithm implemented by the neural network. To evaluate completeness, we first construct the circuit
using the validation data Dval for a specific knowledge type and then test its performance on the test
split Dtest in isolation. By doing so, we can observe any changes in performance compared to the
original model. We use the Hit@10 metric to measure the rank of the target entity o among the top 10
predicted tokens:

Hit@10 =
1
|V |

|V |
X

i=1
I (ranko ≤10)
(3)

Here, |V | represents vocabulary size, and ranko is the rank of the target entity o in predictions.

Dataset.
In this work, we focus on the knowledge that is already stored in the language model.
We utilize the dataset provided by LRE [42] and consider different kinds of knowledge, including
linguistic, commonsense, fact, and bias. We evaluate whether the knowledge is present in the language
model’s parameters under zero-shot settings using the Hit@10 metric to sample knowledge from the
validation set, which is used to construct the knowledge circuit. The data statistics are in Appendix A.

Knowledge Circuits Unveil Implicit Neural Knowledge Representations

Knowledge Circuits Evaluation.
We report the results of GPT2-Medium in Table 1, which
indicates that with only less than 10% of the original knowledge circuit’s subgraph, the model can

5


---Page Break---
maintain over 70% of its original performance. Additionally, we compute the random circuits by
randomly deciding whether the edge should be removed and making sure the graph is connected. The
random circuit is the same size as the circuit we discovered using our method. From the table, we can
see that the random circuit failed to maintain the model’s performance, which further enhanced the
robustness and efficacy of our methods. One of the most fascinating observations is the performance
improvement seen on several test datasets. For instance, the Landmark-country relation metric
increases from 0.16 to 0.36. This suggests that the discovered knowledge circuits may encapsulate
the relevant knowledge, and the model’s performance on these tasks could have been hindered by
noise from other components. We proceed to analyze the layer distribution of the original model
G to understand the average percentage of nodes that are activated within the circuit for different
knowledge domains. From Figure 2, we observe that attention and MLPs are more active in the lower
layers of the network, where the language model processes the input and extracts general information.
To gain a more comprehensive view of the information processing, we compute the average ranko
change of the target token in the Dval across the layers and report the results in Figure 7. This analysis
reveals the phenomenon of early decoding [40], suggesting that by the middle to the latest layers, the
target entity is already present in the residual stream, and the subsequent layers in the Transformer
are designed to increase the probability of the current token (See discussion in the running example).

Special Components in Knowledge Circuits.
From
the discovered knowledge circuits, we can find sev-
eral important attention heads that demonstrate spe-
cific behavior, including the mover head [31], relation
head [17, 43] and mixture head [17, 43] (more defini-
tions in Appendix B.2). Mover Head [31, 27] focuses
on the last token of the context and attends to the subject
token, functioning as a mover to transfer information,
while Relation Head [17] attends to the relation token
in the context and produces some relation-related to-
kens that would guide the behavior of the following
components. We think that these components would be
accumulated by the MLP in the model, and the behavior
of these special heads will be discussed in the running
example part. We list some of these special components
in Table 4 in Appendix. The different attention heads are
responsible for expressing specific types of knowledge
and may be activated by different facts. In our experiments with GPT-2 Medium and GPT-2 Large, we
find that knowledge is distributed across several layers’ attention heads and MLP matrices, suggesting
that the target knowledge appears to have been accumulated throughout the GPT-2 model. Conversely,
in TinyLLAMA, the special components are more concentrated. As depicted in Figure 7, the rank of
the target entity in TinyLLAMA experiences a sharp decline around several layers, whereas in the
GPT2 model, the decline is more gradual. We hypothesize that this discrepancy may be attributed to
the model’s knowledge capacity [44] and warrants further investigation.

A Running Example of Knowledge Circuit.
We present a case and analyze the specific behaviors
of components within the identified knowledge circuits. In particular, we find some special attention
heads in the model such as the mover head and the relation head. We demonstrate the function
of these heads in Figure 6 by ablating them from the circuit. Taking the factual knowledge “The
official language of France is French” as an example, we visualize the knowledge circuit in Figure
1. To express the information flow within the model more effectively, we have plotted the rank and
probability of the target entity o at each layer when it is mapped into the embedding space, in Figure 3.
From this figure, we can see that after MLP 17, the target knowledge emerges as the top token in the
residual stream, and after that layer, it undergoes an increased probability. The edges connected to
MLP17 are (L14H13 →MLP17), (L14H7 →MLP17), and (L15H0 →MLP17) . Here, the L14H13
is a relation head that focuses on the relation token in the context. The output of this head is relation-
related tokens such as “language” and “Language”. The attention head L14H7 is a mover head that
moves the information from the subject position “France” to the last token. Previous work [31, 19]
has introduced this mover head as an argument parser, which moves “France” to the last token, and
the subsequent MLP conducts a function application to map “France” to “French”. An intriguing

6


---Page Break---
observation is that we can find the output of this head already contains the target answer entity, which
significantly contributes to the final output (L14H7 →Output). Also, we see the probability of the
subject token in Figure 3 at the last token is nearly zero across these layers. Hence, instead of the
argument parser function, we consider this mover head as an extract head proposed by Geva et al.
[13], which aims to extract the related-information from the subject token’s position. In the subsequent
knowledge editing experiments, we can observe changes in the behavior of these types of heads.

Additionally, instead of extraction in the later layers
proposed by Geva et al. [13], we notice a gradual
decrease in rank across all early-to-middle layers.
The MLP17 combines information from previous
tokens and integrates this information to prioritize
the target token at the top rank.

Interestingly, upon tracing the information flow to
L14H7, we discovered that it is predominantly ac-
tivated by L7H14, a relation head, and its output
features several language tokens, such as “Arabic”.
We hypothesize that L7H14 may function as a signal-
ing mechanism to activate the associated mover head,
but this hypothesis necessitates further investigation
to be confirmed. After MLP17, several attention
heads, such as L18H14 (a relation head) and L20H6
(a mover head), collaborated to further enhance the
final prediction of the target entity.

Knowledge Circuits Elucidate Internal Mechanisms for Knowledge Editing

In this section, our objective is to evaluate the impact of previous knowledge editing methods and
validate the effectiveness of knowledge circuits. We aim to understand why these methods may fail
in certain cases and settings, which can also help deepen the understanding of the knowledge circuit.

Single Factual Knowledge Editing.
Here, we adopt the ROME method [18] and FT-M [24], which
aim to edit the MLP layers in the language model. The most important hyper-parameter in knowledge
editing is the layer, as the same method’s performance varies significantly via the layers. Here,
we evaluate the performance of different editing layers and their effectiveness. We compare the
knowledge circuits computed by the edited model with the original one, and we present results in
Figure 4 and report details in Appendix D. As discussed in the previous part, the early-to-middle
layers are the main part of aggregating the target entity o to the top rank. In the original model, the
probability of the target entity “Intel” is nearly zero, and the model fails to elevate it to the top rank in
the vocabulary. Editing the model with ROME and FT-M both give us the correct answer but we can
view different scenarios for their knowledge circuits. For ROME, as the correct information is added
to the subject position, we can recognize a behavior of the Mover Head shifts from copying to
extracting the edited information from the subject position. This information gradually aggregates
through the subsequent layers, and by layer 15, “Intel” emerges as the top-ranked entity with its
probability increasing significantly. Specially, before editing, the mover head L15H3 attends to the
“controller” token and returns “controller” as the output, while in the edited model, the attention
head’s output moves to the “Intel”, which means the model gains the information at the subject
space. For FT-M, the edited model tends to directly write the knowledge into the specific component,
which would greatly dominate the following component in the model. As shown in Figure 4, the
output logits in MLP-0 for “Intel” are more than 10, and it emerges as the top rank in the residual
stream directly. This phenomenon can be found in different knowledge types and layers and we report
results in Appendix D.2. However, the added knowledge may have the risk of influencing unrelated
knowledge. When we test another fact “Windows server”, the model still tends to give us the “Intel”
answer, demonstrating the overfitting problem. This finding supports previous analysis regarding the
correlation between localization and editing [45], suggesting that edits may not alter the storage but
merely add signals into the knowledge circuits.

Multi-hop Factual Knowledge Editing.
Multi-hop knowledge editing poses a challenging sce-
nario [20, 21, 46], wherein we edit the model with new knowledge, yet the model struggles to perform
reasoning using the edited information. We analyze multi-hop questions in language models [47, 48]

while for ROME, we observe the mover head select the correct information “Intel”, which means
ROME successfully added the “Intel” to model. For the FT layer-0 editing, we can find this method
directly write the edited knowledge into edited component. However, we find these two editing
methods would affect other unrelated input “Windows server is created by?”

to understand why current editing methods fail in these scenarios. For instance, given the fact (Thierry
Mugle, “home country”, France), we edit the fact to another country, such as (Thierry Mugle, “home
country”, France →China). We then assess the model’s performance on questions based on the
edited knowledge, including “The official currency of the home country of Thierry Mugle is” and
“The capital city of the home country of Thierry Mugle is”. While the unedited model could correctly
answer these questions, we observe that the edited model would provide the answer “China” for
subsequent hop reasoning. We find that the mover head in the original multi-hop reasoning circuit
initially extracts the second-hop answer but, after editing, extracts “China”, demonstrating that the
edited information dominantly saturates and influences the circuit. Furthermore, we observe an in-
triguing phenomenon: even in the original model’s multi-hop reasoning settings, it would directly
provide the answer if we remove the context of the first-hop texts (Details in Appendix C.1).
This further confirms the findings that the model relies on relational and subject-related information,
regardless of grammatical adherence.

Knowledge Circuits Facilitate Interpreting Language Model Behaviors

In this Section, our aim is to validate whether the identified knowledge circuits are actually utilized
by the model when it employs knowledge. To address this, as shown in Figure 5, we investigate three
phenomena: hallucination, in-context learning, and reverse relations (Details in Appendix C.3).

Factual Hallucination.
If the knowledge is stored and expressed by the circuit we discovered, we
aim to discover what happened when the model gave us the incorrect answer. We focus on factual
hallucinations, which occur when the model provides an incorrect target entity for a given subject
s and relation r. In our experiments (Figure 5 and Appendix C.2), we observe that the model fails
to move the correct knowledge to the final token in the earlier layers. This failure is evident as the

(b)  An in-context learning Case

Figure 5: Left: fact hallucination case “The official currency of Malaysia is called”, we observe that,
at layer 15, the Mover Head selects incorrect information. Right: In-context learning case, we
notice that some new heads focusing on the demonstration appear in the knowledge circuit.

circuit lacks an effective mover head or the mover head selects incorrect information. For instance, in
the prompt “The official currency of Malaysia is called”, both the correct answer “Ringgit” and the
incorrect one “Malaysian” are accumulated before layer 15. However, at layer 16, the mover head
L15H10 extracts the erroneous information. Despite a rank drop of the true one in layers 20–22, this
is insufficient to correct the previous mistake.

In-Context Learning.
Despite storing a vast amount of knowledge, a language model may still
provide incorrect answers. However, with demonstrations or examples (based on RAG [49]), it can
quickly generate correct responses. To this end, we focus on the scenario where the model initially
provides an incorrect answer but can then produce the correct response upon receiving the appropriate
demonstration. We consider the original knowledge circuit and introduce a new knowledge circuit
based on the demonstration. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the zero-shot knowledge circuit,
several new attention heads appear in the computation graph when the demonstration is incorporated.
We show the behavior of these attention heads in Figure 5. We can see these heads mainly focus on
the demonstration’s context: “The comparative form of small is smaller” and works as the Induction
Head [50] that look back over the sequence for previous instances of the current token and find the
token that came after it last time. To better view the function of these heads, we conduct experiments
by ablating the newly appeared attention head in the ICL circuit in Table 2. We find that compared to
the randomly selected attention head by ablating this attention, the probability drops significantly in
the prediction, demonstrating the importance of these identified attention heads. These aligned with
previous work where Todd et al. [51] have identified a concept known as the Function Vector, which
represents the average of some key attention heads and provides the task learning ability.

Knowledge Mechanism of Transformers. How the language model stores and utilizes knowledge
is an ongoing research topic. Previous works find that the MLP in Transformers works as a key-
value memory and stores enormous knowledge [12, 15, 14, 18]. As to the relation between entities,
Hernandez et al. [42] observes that facts can be decoded linearly from the enriched residual stream
of the subject by mapping the subject entity to the object entity. Instead of viewing the knowledge
storage in isolation, Geva et al. [13], Lv et al. [31], Yu and Ananiadou [16] find the knowledge is
accumulated during the layers. Regarding knowledge analysis, Bayazit et al. [52] also attempts to
discover critical knowledge in language models. However, they only consider several layers in the

related works can be found in Appendix E.1.

Manipulate Language Models. Recently, many works aim to manipulate the language models to
make the model aligned with world knowledge or social value norms, such as knowledge editing
[20, 24], machine unlearning [53, 54] and detoxification [55, 56]. Most of these works are elicited
by previous knowledge mechanism findings such as knowledge neuron [57]. They modify the MLP
in the LLM [18, 12] to change the model’s behavior based on specific factual knowledge. However,
recent works [58, 59] demonstrate the pivotal role of the attention part in knowledge representation.
Hase et al. [45] also observe that the performance of editing within a layer may not reliably pinpoint
the location of the fact. In this paper, we try to manipulate specific knowledge of language models
via knowledge circuits, including both MLP and attention components across different layers.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a new perspective on knowledge storage based on circuit theory and conduct
a preliminary analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. We found that knowledge circuits in the
model are not only responsible for expressing knowledge but can also guide behavior in different
settings. We hope these findings can advance our understanding of the knowledge mechanisms of
language models and provide insights for better designing and editing language models, enhancing
knowledge, and improving reasoning to enhance factuality and alleviate hallucinations. In the future,
we may further explore how these attention heads are formed during pretraining and activated.

Limitations and Broader Impacts

In this work, we employ the causal mediation method to automatically construct circuits tailored
to specific knowledge domains. However, this circuit discovery-based patching approach is time-
intensive. Contemporary research efforts have introduced more efficient methodologies for modeling
information flow [60–62]. Additionally, alternative techniques for discovering circuits through mask
training [63, 64] and Sparse Auto-Encoders [65, 36] have been proposed, highlighting diverse facets
of circuit behavior within large language models (LLMs). We posit that the field of knowledge
circuit discovery holds significant potential for advancement. Furthermore, recent studies [66] have
developed ’circuit breakers’ to manage representations associated with potentially harmful outputs.
By concentrating on linguistic, factual, commonsense, and bias-related knowledge, we assert that our
methodology can contribute to ensuring the safety and privacy of information, thereby fostering the
development of trustworthy AI.

Implementation Details

Hyper-parameter.
The primary hyperparameter for constructing a circuit is the threshold τ used to
detect performance drops. Setting τ too high may result in an incomplete circuit, while setting it too
low can introduce numerous unnecessary nodes. In our experiment, we test τ values from the set
{0.02, 0.01, 0.005} to determine the appropriate circuit size for different types of knowledge.

Implementation.
We utilize ACDC2 to construct circuits that encode specific knowledge repre-
sentations. Additionally, we re-implement the code to compute the relevant dataset and impact
metrics for the knowledge used. Since TinyLLAMA3 incorporates the Grouped Query Attention
Mechanism [67], we interleave and repeat the key and value pairs to analyze the specific behavior of
each attention head. We use the NVIDIA-A800 (40GB) to conduct our experiments. It took about
1-2 days to compute the circuit for the knowledge type in GPT2-medium.

Dataset Details.
All the data used in our paper
is sourced from Hernandez et al. [42], with the
detailed information provided in Table 6. In the
original setting, they use the data for few-shot
settings, but in our experiments, we consider
zero-shot knowledge storage, so here we sam-
ple the data using the Hit@10 to detect whether
the model understands knowledge for the given
prompt based on the s and o. We sample the test
set in a 1:1 ratio with the validation set to ensure a balanced evaluation.

More Experiment Results

B.1
Rank Change Across Layers

To gain a clearer understanding of the knowledge aggregation phenomenon, we compute the rank
of the target entity ranko within the vocabulary space |V | at the output of each layer. As depicted
in Figure 7, we observe that the model initially elevates the target entity to the top ranks of the
vocabulary. Once the entity reaches the top of the vocabulary, subsequent layers continue to enhance
its probability mass. These findings corroborate previous work by [68–70], who note the substantial
difference in logit entropy between layers, contributing to the model’s improved prediction for the
target entity. In our work, we aim to delve deeper into how the model, as well as specific components
within it, give rise to these behaviors.

B.2
Special Components in Knowledge Circuit

When zooming into the discovered circuit, we can find several kinds of special attention heads, or
MLPs, in the model that play a pivotal role in the final prediction, similar to what previous research
has indicated [31]. Apart from mover head and relation head, there is another kind of head named
Mix Head [17, 43] which would focus on both the relation token and the subject tokens. In our
experiments, we found these heads usually work similarly to the mover head. In particular, mover
heads contribute more to the subject-specific information, as ablating them would increase other
relation-related tokens’ probability. Moreover, if we ablate the relation head, we can find the model
tends to generate some meaningless tokens instead of the relation information. From Figure 3 6, we
can find ablating the mover head would increase the probability of "Italian", "English" and "Spanish",
which are not subject-related. While ablating the relation head would lead to the increase of some
meaningless words "a", and "that", which are not relation-related.

Lv et al. [31] posits that these mover heads are responsible for extracting the “argument” from the
context and passing it for further processing, such as function application. Consequently, Lv et al.
[31], Merullo et al. [19] suggests that the MLP within the language model performs a function

application that transforms the subject into an object, with the subject’s probability ranking higher
than the object’s. However, these findings are limited to specific cases, as the studies only examine
two related tasks, such as capital city identification or color objection. Our analysis suggests that
these conclusions may not be universally applicable to all knowledge domains and require further
investigation. When we examine the ranks of subject and object entities, we rarely observe an
overwhelming superiority at the last token position of the subject token and usually, the probability
of the subject token at the last position is uniformly low. In our experiment, we view the model as a
collaboration between different nodes in the identified circuit. They perform as different kinds of

attention heads, like mover head and relation head. We list some heads that are responsible for the
storage of different kinds of knowledge and relations in Table 4.

Component Reuse Phenomenon.
Merullo et al. [27] have identified shared circuits for the IOI task
and the Colored Objects task. We also observe this phenomenon in the factual recall task. As depicted
in Table 4, we can observe that for related relations such as “city_in_country”, “name_birth_place”,
and “country_language”, their circuits include both L21H12, which stores and maps country-related
information. Additionally, we found that some relation heads are activated by different relations. For
instance, in our experiments, the head ‘L7H14’ appears in the circuits of both “official_language”
and “official_currency”. We speculate that these reused heads, rather than task-specific heads, can
be considered topic heads, as proposed by [71, 60]. We believe that further investigation into this
distinction is warranted in future research.

C
More Circuit Utilization Analysis

While previous work on knowledge storage suggests that knowledge may be localized in specific
areas of the model, it is essential to ascertain whether the model actively employs this knowledge
when encountering related contexts or if it relies on shortcuts.

C.1
Multi-hop Factual Knowledge Editing

We consider scenarios where the model makes a correct prediction for all the multi-hop questions and
single-hop questions. We found a circuit reuse phenomenon in the one-hop and multi-hop knowledge
circuits. Here, we first compute the proportion of the nodes Nsingle in the single-hop circuit Csingle
that appears in Nmultiple the set of nodes in the multi-hop circuit Cmultiple .

Hitnode = |Nmultiple| ∩|Nsingle|

|Nsingle|
(4)

Actually, there are two ways for the model to conduct multi-hop reasoning. As shown in the
figure, the model can also answer the question by combining the two hop relations together (in
the given case, combine “hometown” and “language” as “mother tongue”) If the model is capa-
ble of combining two-hop relations in a more integrated or semantic way, such as inferring that
the “mother tongue” is the language of one’s hometown, this suggests a more complex reasoning
process that goes beyond the simple overlap of nodes and edges. To capture this kind of reason-
ing, we assess the model’s ability to integrate information from different hops. Rintegrated as
the set of integrated relations (new paths created by combining information from different hops)

Table 5: Hit for different hop

Second-hop
Integrate
node
83.33
70.27
71.42
edge
63.20
45.27
49.42

We observe an overlap of these circuit nodes,
indicating that the language model utilizes a
large portion of the nodes in the original single
hop’s circuit, especially the mover head. From
the overlap analysis, it seems the model utilizes
single-hop information to conduct reasoning.
We discover an intriguing phenomenon in GPT-
2 and TinyLLAMA: the models can correctly answer first-hop knowledge and perform multi-hop
reasoning based on it. However, interestingly, when we delete the first-hop knowledge while retaining
only the second-hop relation and the first-hop subject, the models can still correctly answer the
multi-hop question. Figure 10 illustrates a specific case in our findings. It further enhances our
previous findings that the model actually conducts the factual recall with the relation head and the
gathered information about the subject. Moreover, we found this phenomenon is hugely alleviated
by the aligned model, which requires further investigation in the future.

C.2
Hallucination

The results are presented in Figure 5. We observe an interesting phenomenon: the correct answer and
the wrong answer are both accumulated at the previous layer, but at some specific layers, the wrong
answer is selected as the answer to extract. We hypothesize that there may be a circuit competition
here proposed by [72] and we detect the behavior of the specific component between them.

C.3
Reverse Relation

Reverse Curse [73] is an important issue in language models when models successfully give us the
correct answer o for (s, r), but with a reverse relation ˆr and o, the models fail to give us the correct
subject s. In this part, we endeavor to investigate how the language model manages the reverse
relation when they successfully store the knowledge. We first sample facts where the language
model successfully predicts the given knowledge and the reversed fact. Then, we compute the
overlap between these two circuits, Cd and Cr under node levels based on equation 4. We select the
“superhero_person” relation to see the difference between these two circuits and test the node overlap
of the two circuits in the model. We notice that the overlap between the two circuits is about 70%,
indicating the language model may store the related information in the same place. We also found the
activated mover heads for the two relationships to be identical.

Edit Experiments

D.1
Method Implementation

ROME
As proposed by Meng et al. [18], ROME views knowledge editing as a minimal optimization
problem. ROME regards the MLP module as a simple key-value store. Specifically, the key represents
a subject and the value encapsulates knowledge about that subject, the MLP can reestablish the
association by retrieving the corresponding value for the key. To add a new key-value pair, ROME
applies a rank-one modification to the MLP’s weights, effectively “writing in” the new information
directly. This method enables more direct and precise modification of the model’s knowledge. The
ROME method for model editing was conducted based on the EasyEdit[74] framework, utilizing the
default parameters provided by EasyEdit. The experiments are performed on an A800 80G GPU,
with approximately 8GB of memory consumption.

For Fine-Tuning (FT-M), we follow Zhang et al. [24]. It trains the MLP layer using the cross-
entropy loss on the target answer while masking the original text. This approach aligns more closely
with the traditional fine-tuning object. The FT-M method is conducted using the EasyEdit4 [74]
framework, with the default parameters provided by EasyEdit. The experiments are also performed
on an A800 80G GPU, with a memory consumption of approximately 10GB.

Edit Cases on FT-M and ROME

When a circuit is established for a particular piece of knowledge, we can manipulate the model’s
computation by targeting critical points within the circuit. Li et al. [75] ablates a small number of
important causal pathways by masking the edges in the circuit and making the model less toxic and
safer, which proves the effectiveness of the circuit. As illustrated in figure 12 and figure 13, we
present the changes in the ranking of the predicted probabilities for the target new token when editing
layer 6, 12, and 18 of the GPT-2 medium model using FT-M and ROME methods. When applying
FT-M for model editing, it is evident that the rank of the target new token’s probability sharply

Figure 11: The knowledge circuit obtained from the edited model for the case “Platform Controller
Hub was created by” with the target entity “Intel” shows that when editing the model using different
layers, the fine-tuned settings allow the edited MLP to directly provide the edited information.

Figure 12: FT-M Rank Change Across Different Layers

declines at the corresponding edited layer, resulting in a vertical line in the figure. This indicates that
FT-M directly embeds the editing information into the model’s information flow. Conversely, when
using the ROME method for editing, this effect is mitigated. The predicted probability of the target
new token reaches its peak only a few layers after the edited layer. This observation is consistent with
our previous analysis in Section 5.

Knowledge in MLP
Geva et al. [76] claim that MLP serves as key-value memories for knowledge
in LMs. Geva et al. [77] further propose the knowledge neuron theory, suggesting that the key and

24

Figure 13: ROME Rank Change Across Different Layers

value vectors in MLPs encode factual knowledge. Based on the above findings, Chen et al. [78]
observe that multiple distinct sets of KNs can store identical facts. Chen et al. [79] explore the
structural and functional among neurons by neurological topology clustering method. Meng et al.
[18] and Meng et al. [80] confirm that MLP modules do store factual knowledge and pioneering use
of knowledge editing methods to modify outdated knowledge stored in language models. Anthropic
recently introduces scaling monosemanticity5, which extracts highly abstract features that respond to
and behaviorally cause abstract behaviors.

Knowledge in Attention Heads
Li et al. [58] reveal that some attention heads are capable of truthful
answers. Wu et al. [81] investigate 4 model families, 6 model scales, and 3 types of finetuning, and
find retrieval heads, which are responsible for retrieving relevant information from long context. Jin
et al. [82] suggest that memory heads can retrieve knowledge from internal memory, while context
heads can recall knowledge from external context. Todd et al. [83] use causal mediation analysis on a
diverse range of in-context-learning and find some attention heads, dubbed function vectors, which
trigger the ability of in-context-learning.

Knowledge in Hybrid Components
Recent works emphasize the importance of connections of
components among language models for knowledge representation and utilization. Geva et al. [13]
describe factual recall by the following three steps: (1) subject enrichment in MLP sublayers, akin to
ROME [18], (2) propagation of relations to the END token, and (3) selective extraction of attributes by
attention heads in later layers. Lv et al. [31] apply projection and intervention to explore mechanisms
in factual recalls tasks and conclude that task-specific attention head may move the topic entity to the
final position of the residual stream, while MLP conducts relation function.

Circuit
Circuit discovery also plays a significant role in analyzing the internal mechanisms of
the entire model [25]. Specifically, a circuit, comprising components such as MLP and attention,
is a subgraph of the computation graph. Conmy et al. [32] design an automated circuit discovery
approach that implements the specified behavior. Wang et al. [26] explain the circuits for the Indirect
Object Identification (IOI) task. They use causal interventions to discover circuits responsible for
the flow of information. Instead the above task-specific circuit, Merullo et al. [27] presents evidence
a circuit is shared by similar tasks in IOI and Color Object (CO) tasks. Dutta et al. [84] construct
circuits using attention heads, and further observe that attention heads are pivotal to chain-of-thought
reasoning, i.e., attention heads that move information along ontological relations exclusively appear
in the initial half of the layers, while the tokens responsible for writing the answer predominantly
appear in the later half of the layers. However, the above-mentioned circuit studies either focus solely

5https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html

25


---Page Break---
on a single component (MLP or attention) or only explore IOI and CO tasks. IOI and CO tasks
necessitate the model to search the preceding context for a matching token and then copy it into the
next token prediction. Also, despite the success of previous circuit discovery, we can hardly make it
into real usage. Hence, in this work, we attempt to analyze a knowledge circuit consisting of both
MLP and attention components and investigate the effect of current editing methods on the circuit to
shed light on the future.

Tools
There are also many tools that are designed to analyze the LM’s behavior, such as Logit
Lens [85], Attention len [86], Attribution lens [42] and transformer-lens [41]. NeuroX [87] imple-
ments various interpretation methods under a unified API and provides insights into how knowledge
is structured in representations and discovers the role of neurons in LM. Transformer Debugger [88]
is an interpretability tool provided by OpenAI, which deploys the GPT-4 and sparse auto-encoder to
explain the language neurons and attention head. PatchScope [89] is a tool provided by Google that
uses a new model to explain the hidden states in the original model.

E.2
Limitation and Future Discussion

Despite of the attempt to combine the attention head and MLP to view the knowledge storage
as a whole, this work operates with a relatively coarse granularity of circuits. For instance, the
neurons within an MLP may necessitate a finer level of granularity to fully capture their behavior and
contributions. Even though we now know these components work together to express the knowledge,
why they are activated is still opaque. Our methodology employs the logit lens as a means to
detect and analyze component information. However, this approach may encounter discrepancies
between the middle layers and the output unembedding matrix. Such discrepancies can hinder a
comprehensive and concrete analysis of the circuit components’ behavior in the early layers. This
limitation suggests the need for more robust techniques to bridge the gap between intermediate
representations and final outputs. Recently, the Attention Lens method [86] has been proposed, which
involves training a specific unembedding matrix to map each attention head into the vocabulary space.
While this method is promising, it is also resource-intensive. Nevertheless, it represents a potential
starting point for a deeper understanding of the knowledge circuits within neural models. Moreover,
our research indicates that several mover heads are reused across different types of knowledge or
relational contexts. The mechanisms by which these heads are activated and the conditions under
which they operate require further exploration and may shed light on why neurons are sometimes
“monosemantic” responding to a single feature, and sometimes “polysemantic” [90] responding to
many unrelated features.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Abstract and Section 1 Introduction

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification:Section 8 Limitations and Appendix E.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

27


---Page Break---
Justification: No theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the setup throughout the paper as well as in the Subsection 3.3 and
Appendix A
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly available datasets (Appendix A), Code and Data are also
provided in supplemental material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the setup throughout the paper as well as in the Subsection 3.3 and
Appendix A
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: [No]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

29


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Appendix A
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer:[Yes]
Justification: We use publicly standard datasets that do not contain information about
individual people or offensive context to our knowledge. Ethical considerations are discussed
in Section 8.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Section 8
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

30


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly available artifacts and show them in Section 3.3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

31


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
