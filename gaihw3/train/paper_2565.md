Abstract

Efficient exploration in contextual bandits is crucial due to their large action space,
1

where uninformed exploration can lead to computational and statistical inefficien-
2

cies. However, the rewards of actions are often correlated, which can be leveraged
3

for more efficient exploration. In this work, we use pre-trained diffusion model pri-
4

ors to capture these correlations and develop diffusion Thompson sampling (dTS).
5

We establish both theoretical and algorithmic foundations for dTS. Specifically,
6

we derive efficient posterior approximations (required by dTS) under a diffusion
7

model prior, which are of independent interest beyond bandits and reinforcement
8

learning. We analyze dTS in linear instances and provide a Bayes regret bound
9

highlighting the benefits of using diffusion models as priors. Our experiments
10

validate our theory and demonstrate dTS’s favorable performance.

Introduction
12

A contextual bandit is a popular and practical framework for online learning under uncertainty [Li
13

et al., 2010]. In each round, an agent observes a context, takes an action, and receives a reward based
14

on the context and action. The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward over n rounds,
15

striking a balance between exploiting actions with high estimated rewards from available data and
16

exploring other actions to improve current estimates. This trade-off is often addressed using either
17

upper confidence bound (UCB) [Auer et al., 2002] or Thompson sampling (TS) [Scott, 2010].
18

The action space in contextual bandits is often large, resulting in less-than-optimal performance
19

with standard exploration strategies. Luckily, actions usually exhibit correlations, making efficient
20

exploration possible as one action may inform the agent about other actions. In particular, Thompson
21

sampling offers remarkable flexibility, allowing its integration with informative priors [Hong et al.,
22

2022b] that capture these correlations. Inspired by the achievements of diffusion models [Sohl-
23

Dickstein et al., 2015, Ho et al., 2020], which effectively approximate complex distributions [Dhariwal
24

and Nichol, 2021, Rombach et al., 2022], this work captures action correlations by employing
25

diffusion models as priors in contextual Thompson sampling.
26

We illustrate the idea using video streaming. The objective is to optimize watch time for a user j
27

by selecting a video i from a catalog of K videos. Users j and videos i are associated with context
28

vectors xj and unknown video parameters θi, respectively. User j’s expected watch time for video i
29

is linear as x⊤
j θi. Then, a natural strategy is to independently learn video parameters θi using LinTS
30

or LinUCB [Agrawal and Goyal, 2013a, Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011], but this proves statistically
31

inefficient for larger K. Fortunately, the reward when recommending a movie can provide informative
32

insights into other movies. To capture this, we leverage offline estimates of video parameters denoted
33

by ˆθi and build a diffusion model on them. This diffusion model approximates the video parameter
34

distribution, capturing their dependencies. This model enriches contextual Thompson sampling as a
35

prior, effectively capturing complex video dependencies while ensuring computational efficiency.

We introduce a framework for contextual bandits with diffusion model priors, upon which we develop
37

diffusion Thompson sampling (dTS) that is both computationally and statistically efficient. dTS
38

requires fast updates of the posterior and fast sampling from the posterior, both of which are achieved
39

through our novel efficient posterior approximations. These approximations become exact when
40

both the diffusion model and likelihood are linear. We establish a bound on dTS’s Bayes regret for
41

this specific case, highlighting the advantages of using diffusion models as priors. Our empirical
42

evaluations validate our theory and demonstrate dTS’s strong performance across various settings.
43

Diffusion models were applied in offline decision-making [Ajay et al., 2022, Janner et al., 2022, Wang
44

et al., 2022], but their use in online learning was only recently explored by Hsieh et al. [2023], who
45

focused on multi-armed bandits without theoretical guarantees. Our work extends Hsieh et al. [2023]
46

in two ways. First, we apply the concept to the broader contextual bandit, which is more practical and
47

realistic. Second, we demonstrate that with diffusion models parametrized by linear score functions
48

and linear rewards, we can derive exact closed-form posteriors without approximations. These exact
49

posteriors are valuable as they enable theoretical analysis (unlike Hsieh et al. [2023], who did not
50

provide theoretical guarantees) and motivate efficient approximations for non-linear score functions
51

in contextual bandits, addressing gaps in Hsieh et al. [2023]’s focus on multi-armed bandits.
52

A key contribution, beyond applying diffusion models in contextual bandits, is the efficient com-
53

putation and sampling of the posterior distribution of a d-dimensional parameter θ | Ht, with Ht
54

representing the data, when using a diffusion model prior on θ. This is relevant not only to bandits
55

and reinforcement learning but also to a broader range of applications [Chung et al., 2022]. To
56

motivate our approximations, we start with exact closed-form solutions for cases where both the
57

score functions of the diffusion model and the likelihood are linear. These solutions form the basis for
58

our approximations for non-linear score functions, demonstrating both strong empirical performance
59

and computational efficiency. Our approach avoids the computational burden of heavy approximate
60

sampling algorithms required for each latent parameter. For a detailed comparison with existing
61

studies, see Appendix A, where we discuss diffusion models in decision-making, structured bandits,
62

approximate posteriors, and more.

Setting
64

The agent interacts with a contextual bandit over n rounds. In round t ∈[n], the agent observes a
65

context Xt ∈X, where X ⊆Rd is a context space, it takes an action At ∈[K], and then receives a
66

stochastic reward Yt ∈R that depends on both the context Xt and the taken action At. Each action
67

i ∈[K] is associated with an unknown action parameter θ∗,i ∈Rd, so that the reward received in
68

round t is Yt ∼P(· | Xt; θ∗,At), where P(· | x; θ∗,i) is the reward distribution of action i in context
69

x. Throughout the paper, we assume that the reward distribution is parametrized as a generalized
70

linear model (GLM) [McCullagh and Nelder, 1989]. That is, for any x ∈X, P(· | x; θ∗,i) is an
71

exponential-family distribution with mean g(x⊤θ∗,i), where g is the mean function. For example, we
72

recover linear bandits when P(· | x; θ∗,i) = N(·; x⊤θ∗,i, σ2) where σ > 0 is the observation noise.
73

Similarly, we recover logistic bandits [Filippi et al., 2010] if we let g(u) = (1 + exp(−u))−1 and
74

P(· | x; θ∗,i) = Ber(g(x⊤θ∗,i)), where Ber(p) be the Bernoulli distribution with mean p.
75

We consider the Bayesian bandit setting [Russo and Van Roy, 2014, Hong et al., 2022b], where the
76

action parameters θ∗,i are assumed to be sampled from a known prior distribution. We proceed to
77

define this prior distribution using a diffusion model. The correlations between the action parameters
78

θ∗,i are captured through a diffusion model, where they share a set of L consecutive unknown latent
79

parameters ψ∗,ℓ∈Rd for ℓ∈[L]. Precisely, the action parameter θ∗,i depends on the L-th latent
80

parameter ψ∗,L as θ∗,i | ψ∗,1 ∼N(f1(ψ∗,1), Σ1), where the score function f1 : Rd →Rd is known.
81

Also, the ℓ−1-th latent parameter ψ∗,ℓ−1 depends on the ℓ-th latent parameter ψ∗,ℓas ψ∗,ℓ−1 | ψ∗,ℓ∼
82

N(fℓ(ψ∗,ℓ), Σℓ), where the score function fℓ: Rd →Rd is known. Finally, the L-th latent parameter
83

ψ∗,L is sampled as ψ∗,L ∼N(0, ΣL+1). We summarize this model in (1) and its graph in Fig. 1.

---Page Break---
The model in (1) represents a Bayesian bandit, where the agent interacts with a bandit instance
86

defined by θ∗,i over n rounds (4-th line in (1)). These action parameters θ∗,i are drawn from the
87

generative process in the first 3 lines of (1). In practice, (1) can be built by pre-training a diffusion
88

model on offline estimates of the action parameters θ∗,i [Hsieh et al., 2023].
89

A natural goal for the agent in this Bayesian framework is to minimize its Bayes regret [Russo and Van
90

Roy, 2014] that measures the expected performance across multiple bandit instances θ∗= (θ∗,i)i∈[K],

r(x, i; θ∗) = EY ∼P (·|x;θ∗,i) [Y ] is the expected reward of action i in context x and At,∗=
93

arg maxi∈[K] r(Xt, i; θ∗) is the optimal action in round t. The Bayes regret is known to capture the
94

benefits of using informative priors, and hence it is suitable for our problem.
95

Diffusion contextual Thompson sampling
96

We design Thompson sampling that samples the latent and action parameters hierarchically [Lindley
97

and Smith, 1972]. Precisely, let Ht = (Xk, Ak, Yk)k∈[t−1] be the history of all interactions up to
98

round t and let Ht,i = (Xk, Ak, Yk){k∈[t−1];Ak=i} be the history of interactions with action i up to
99

round t. To motivate our algorithm, we decompose the posterior P (θ∗,i = θ | Ht) recursively as
100

P (θ∗,i = θ | Ht) =
Z

ψ1:L
Qt,L(ψL)

L
Y

ℓ=2
Qt,ℓ−1(ψℓ−1 | ψℓ)Pt,i(θ | ψ1) dψ1:L ,
where
(3)

Qt,L(ψL) = P (ψ∗,L = ψL | Ht) is the latent-posterior density of ψ∗,L | Ht. Moreover, for any
101

ℓ∈[2 : L], Qt,ℓ−1(ψℓ−1 | ψℓ) = P (ψ∗,ℓ−1 = ψℓ−1 | Ht, ψ∗,ℓ= ψℓ) is the conditional latent-
102

posterior density of ψ∗,ℓ−1 | Ht, ψ∗,ℓ= ψℓ. Finally, for any action i ∈[K], Pt,i(θ | ψ1) =
103

P (θ∗,i = θ | Ht,i, ψ∗,1 = ψ1) is the conditional action-posterior density of θ∗,i | Ht,i, ψ∗,1 = ψ1.
104

The decomposition in (3) inspires hierarchical sampling. In round t, we initially sample the L-th
105

latent parameter as ψt,L ∼Qt,L(·). Then, for ℓ∈[L]/{1}, we sample the ℓ−1-th latent parameter
106

given that ψ∗,ℓ= ψt,ℓ, as ψt,ℓ−1 ∼Qt,ℓ−1(· | ψt,ℓ). Lastly, given that ψ∗,1 = ψt,1, each action
107

parameter is sampled individually as θt,i ∼Pt,i(θ | ψt,1). This is possible because action parameters
108

θ∗,i are conditionally independent given ψ∗,1. This leads to Algorithm 1, named diffusion Thompson
109

Sampling (dTS). dTS requires sampling from the K + L posteriors Pt,i and Qt,ℓ. Thus we start by
110

providing an efficient recursive scheme to express these posteriors using known quantities. We note
111

that these expressions do not necessarily lead to closed-form posteriors and approximation might be
112

needed. First, the conditional action-posterior Pt,i(· | ψ1) can be written as
113

Pt,i(θ | ψ1) ∝
Y

k∈St,i
P(Yk | Xk; θ)N(θ; f1(ψ1), Σ1) ,
(4)

where St,i = {ℓ∈[t −1], Aℓ= i} are the rounds where the agent takes action i up to round t.
114

Moreover, let Lℓ(ψℓ) = P (Ht | ψ∗,ℓ= ψℓ) be the likelihood of observations up to round t given that
115

ψ∗,ℓ= ψℓ. Then, for any ℓ∈[L]/{1}, the ℓ−1-th conditional latent-posterior Qt,ℓ−1(· | ψℓ) is
116

Qt,ℓ−1(ψℓ−1 | ψℓ) ∝Lℓ−1(ψℓ−1)N(ψℓ−1, fℓ(ψℓ), Σℓ) ,
(5)
and Qt,L(ψL) ∝LL(ψL)N(ψL, 0, ΣL+1). All the terms above are known, except the likelihoods
117

Lℓ(ψℓ) for ℓ∈[L]. These are computed recursively as follows. First, the basis of the recursion is
118

L1(ψ1) =

K
Y

i=1

Z

θi

Y

k∈St,i
P(Yk | Xk; θi)N(θi; f1(ψ1), Σ1) dθi.
(6)

Then for ℓ∈[L]/{1}, the recursive step is Lℓ(ψℓ) =
R

ψℓ−1 Lℓ−1(ψℓ−1)N(ψℓ−1; fℓ(ψℓ), Σℓ) dψℓ−1.
119

All posterior expressions above use known quantities (fℓ, Σℓ, P(y | x; θ)). However, these expres-
120

sions typically need to be approximated, except when the score functions fℓare linear and the reward
121

distribution P(· | x; θ) is linear-Gaussian, where closed-form solutions can be obtained with careful
122

derivations. These approximations are not trivial, and prior studies often rely on computationally
123

intensive approximate sampling algorithms. In the following sections, we explain how we derive our
124

efficient approximations which are motivated by the closed-form solutions of linear instances.

3.1
Linear diffusion model
126

Assume the score functions fℓare linear such as fℓ(ψ∗,ℓ) = Wℓψ∗,ℓfor ℓ∈[L], where Wℓ∈Rd×d
127

are known mixing matrices. Then, (1) becomes a linear Gaussian system (LGS) [Bishop, 2006] in
128

this case. This model is important, both in theory and practice. For theory, it leads to closed-form
129

posteriors when the reward distribution is linear-Gaussian as P(· | x; θ∗,i) = N(·; x⊤θ∗,i, σ2). This
130

allows bounding the Bayes regret of dTS. For practice, the posterior expressions are used to motivate
131

efficient approximations for the general case in (1) as we show in Section 3.2.
132

The reward distribution is parameterized as a generalized linear model (GLM) [McCullagh and
133

Nelder, 1989], allowing for non-linear rewards. Thus, we need posterior approximation despite
134

linearity in score functions. Since this non-linearity arises solely from the reward distribution, we
135

approximate it by a Gaussian and propagate this approximation to the latent parameters. This results
136

in efficient posterior approximations that are exact when the reward function is Gaussian (a special
137

case of the GLM model). Specifically, the reward distribution P(· | x; θ) is an exponential family
138

distribution with a mean function denoted by g. Then, we approximate the corresponding likelihood
139

as P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) ≈N
 
θ; ˆBt,i, ˆG−1
t,i

, where ˆBt,i and ˆGt,i are the maximum likelihood estimate
140

(MLE) and the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood, respectively, and they are defined as
141

ˆBt,i = arg maxθ∈Rd log P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) ,
ˆGt,i = P

k∈St,i ˙g

(7)

where St,i = {ℓ∈[t −1] : Aℓ= i} represents the rounds where the agent takes action i up to
142

round t. This simple approximation makes all posteriors Gaussian. Specifically, the conditional
143

action-posterior is Gaussian and is given by Pt,i(· | ψ1) = N(·; ˆµt,i, ˆΣt,i), where ˆµt,i and ˆΣt,i are
144

computed using ˆBt,i and ˆGt,i in (7). Moreover, for ℓ∈[L−1], the ℓ-th conditional latent-posterior is
145

also Gaussian, Qt,ℓ(· | ψℓ+1) = N(·; ¯µt,ℓ, ¯Σt,ℓ), where ¯µt,ℓand ¯Σt,ℓare computed recursively. The
146

recursion starts with ¯µt,1 and ¯Σt,1, which are calculated using ˆBt,i and ˆGt,i in (7). Full expressions are
147

provided in Appendix B.1. The only approximation made is P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) ≈N
 
θ; ˆBt,i, ˆG−1
t,i

,
148

and we propagated it to latent posteriors. Thus, these posterior approximations become exact when
149

the reward distribution follows a linear-Gaussian model, P(· | x; θ∗,a) = N(·; x⊤θ∗,a, σ2).
150

3.2
Non-linear diffusion model
151

After deriving the posteriors for linear score functions, we return to the general model in (1).
152

Approximation is needed since both the score functions and rewards can be non-linear. To avoid
153

computational challenges, we use a simple and intuitive approximation, where all posteriors Pt,i
154

and Qt,ℓare approximated by Gaussians that are computed recursively. First, the conditional action-
155

posterior is approximated by a Gaussian distribution as Pt,i(· | ψ1) = N(·; ˆµt,i, ˆΣt,i), where
156

ˆΣ−1
t,i = Σ−1

.
(8)

In the absence of samples, Gt,i = 0d×d. Thus, the approximate action posterior in (8) matches
157

precisely the term N(f1(ψ1), Σ1) in the diffusion prior (1). Moreover, as more data is accumulated,
158

Gt,i increases, and the influence of the prior diminishes as ˆGt,i ˆBt,i will dominate the prior term
159

Σ−1
1 f1(ψ1). Similarly, for ℓ∈[L]/{1}, the ℓ−1-th conditional latent-posterior is approximated by
160

---Page Break---
a Gaussian distribution as Qt,ℓ−1(· | ψℓ) = N(¯µt,ℓ−1, ¯Σt,ℓ−1), where

L+1 + ¯Gt,L ,
¯µt,L = ¯Σt,L ¯Bt,L .
(10)

Here, ¯Gt,ℓand ¯Bt,ℓfor ℓ∈[L] are computed recursively. The basis of the recursion are

Similarly, in the absence of samples, Qt,ℓ−1 in (9) precisely matches the term N(fℓ(ψ1), Σℓ) in the
165

diffusion prior (1). As more data is accumulated, the influence of this prior diminishes. Therefore,
166

this approximation retains a key attribute of exact posteriors: they match the prior when there is no
167

data, and the prior’s effect diminishes as data accumulates.

Analysis
169

We analyze dTS under the linear diffusion model in Section 3.1 with linear rewards P(· | x; θ∗,a) =
170

N(·; x⊤θ∗,a, σ2). This assumption leads to a structure with L layers of linear Gaussian relationships,
171

allowing for theory inspired by linear bandits [Agrawal and Goyal, 2013a, Abbasi-Yadkori et al.,
172

2011]. However, proofs are not the same, and technical challenges remain (explained in Appendix D).
173

Although our result holds for milder assumptions, we make some simplifications for clarity and
174

interpretability. We assume that (A1) Contexts satisfy ∥Xt∥2
2 = 1 for any t ∈[n]. (A2) Mixing
175

matrices and covariances satisfy λ1(W⊤
ℓWℓ) = 1 for any ℓ∈[L] and Σℓ= σ2
ℓId for any ℓ∈[L + 1].
176

Note that (A1) can be relaxed to any contexts Xt with bounded norms ∥Xt∥2. Also, (A2) can be
177

relaxed to positive definite covariances Σℓand arbitrary mixing matrices Wℓ. In this section, we
178

write ˜O for the big-O notation up to polylogarithmic factors. We start by stating our bound for dTS.

(13) holds for any δ ∈(0, 1). In particular, the term cnδ is constant when δ = 1/n. Then, the
182

bound is ˜O(√n), and this dependence on the horizon n aligns with prior Bayes regret bounds. The
183

bound comprises L + 1 main terms, RACT(n) and RLAT
ℓ
for ℓ∈[L]. First, RACT(n) relates to action
184

parameters learning, conforming to a standard form [Lu and Van Roy, 2019]. Similarly, RLAT
ℓ
is
185

associated with learning the ℓ-th latent parameter. Roughly speaking, our bound captures that our
186

problem can be seen as L + 1 sequential linear bandit instances stacked upon each other.
187

Technical contributions. dTS uses hierarchical sampling. Thus the marginal posterior distribution of
188

θ∗,i | Ht is not explicitly defined. The first contribution is deriving θ∗,i | Ht using the total covariance
189

decomposition combined with an induction proof, as our posteriors in Section 3.1 were derived
190

recursively. Unlike standard analyses where the posterior distribution of θ∗,i | Ht is predetermined
191

due to the absence of latent parameters, our method necessitates this recursive total covariance
192

decomposition. Moreover, in standard proofs, we need to quantify the increase in posterior precision
193

for the action taken At in each round t ∈[n]. However, in dTS, our analysis extends beyond this.
194

We not only quantify the posterior information gain for the taken action but also for every latent
195

parameter, since they are also learned. To elaborate, we use the recursive formulas in Section 3.1 that
196

connect the posterior covariance of each latent parameter ψ∗,ℓwith the covariance of the posterior
197

action parameters θ∗,i. This allows us to propagate the information gain associated with the action
198

5


---Page Break---
taken in round At to all latent parameters ψ∗,ℓ, for ℓ∈[L] by induction. Finally, we carefully bound
199

the resulting terms so that the constants reflect the parameters of the linear diffusion model. More
200

technical details are provided in Appendix D.
201

To include more structure, we propose the sparsity assumption (A3) Wℓ= ( ¯Wℓ, 0d,d−dℓ), where
202

¯Wℓ∈Rd×dℓfor any ℓ∈[L]. Note that (A3) is not an assumption when dℓ= d for any ℓ∈[L].
203

Notably, (A3) incorporates a plausible structural characteristic that a diffusion model could capture.

205

dTS under Section 3.1 with linear rewards, (A1), (A2) and (A3) is bounded as

. The
207

Bayes regret bound has a clear interpretation: if the true environment parameters are drawn from
208

the prior, then the expected regret of an algorithm stays below that bound. Consequently, a less
209

informative prior (such as high variance) leads to a more challenging problem and thus a higher
210

bound. Then, smaller values of K, L, d or dℓtranslate to fewer parameters to learn, leading to lower
211

regret. The regret also decreases when the initial variances σ2
ℓdecrease. These dependencies are
212

common in Bayesian analysis, and empirical results match them. The reader might question the
213

dependence of our bound on both L and K. We will address this next.
214

Why the bound increases with K? This arises due to our conditional learning of θ∗,i given
215

ψ∗,1. Rather than assuming deterministic linearity, θ∗,i = W1ψ∗,1, we account for stochasticity by
216

modeling θ∗,i ∼N(W1ψ∗,1, σ2
1Id). This makes dTS robust to misspecification scenarios where θ∗,i
217

is not perfectly linear with respect to ψ∗,1, at the cost of additional learning of θ∗,i | ψ∗,1. If we were
218

to assume deterministic linearity (σ1 = 0), our regret bound would scale with L only.
219

Why the bound increases with L? This is because increasing the number of layers L adds more
220

initial uncertainty due to the additional covariance introduced by the extra layers. However, this does
221

not imply that we should always use L = 1 (the minimum possible L). While a higher L complicates
222

online learning and increases regret bound, it also enables the capture of a more complex prior
223

distribution through offline pre-training of the diffusion model. Thus, a trade-off exists in practice.
224

A smaller L results in faster computation and easier learning for dTS, but the learned prior might
225

deviate from reality, potentially violating the "true prior assumption" used to derive the regret bound.
226

On the other hand, a larger L allows for better modeling of complex action distributions, producing a
227

prior that more accurately reflects reality and strengthens the validity of the bound.
228

Discussion
229

Computational benefits. Action correlations prompt an intuitive approach: marginalize all latent
230

parameters and maintain a joint posterior of (θ∗,i)i∈[K] | Ht. Unfortunately, this is computationally
231

inefficient for large action spaces. To illustrate, suppose that all posteriors are multivariate Gaussians
232

(Section 3.1). Then maintaining the joint posterior (θ∗,i)i∈[K] | Ht necessitates converting and
233

storing its dK × dK-dimensional covariance matrix. Then the time and space complexities are
234

O(K3d3) and O(K2d2). In contrast, the time and space complexities of dTS are O
  
L + K

d3
235

and O
  
L + K

d2
. This is because dTS requires converting and storing L + K covariance matrices,
236

each being d × d-dimensional. The improvement is huge when K ≫L, which is common in
237

practice. Certainly, a more straightforward way to enhance computational efficiency is to discard
238

latent parameters and maintain K individual posteriors, each relating to an action parameter θ∗,i ∈Rd
239

(LinTS). This improves time and space complexity to O
 
Kd3
and O
 
Kd2
, respectively. However,
240

LinTS maintains independent posteriors and fails to capture the correlations among actions; it only
241

models θ∗,i | Ht,i rather than θ∗,i | Ht as done by dTS. Consequently, LinTS incurs higher regret
242

due to the information loss caused by unused interactions of similar actions. Our regret bound and
243

empirical results reflect this aspect.
244

Statistical benefits. We do not provide a matching lower bound. The only Bayesian lower bound
245

that we know of is Ω(log2(n)) for a much simpler K-armed bandit [Lai, 1987, Theorem 3]. All
246

6


---Page Break---
seminal works on Bayesian bandits do not match it and providing such lower bounds on Bayes regret
247

is still relatively unexplored (even in standard settings) compared to the frequentist one. Therefore,
248

we argue that our bound reflects the overall structure of the problem by comparing dTS to algorithms
249

that only partially use the structure or do not use it at all as follows.
250

The linear diffusion model in Section 3.1 can be transformed into a Bayesian linear model (LinTS)
251

by marginalizing out the latent parameters; in which case the prior on action parameters becomes
252

θ∗,i ∼N(0, Σ), with the θ∗,i being not necessarily independent, and Σ is the marginal initial
253

covariance of action parameters and it writes Σ = σ2
1Id + PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1BℓB⊤
ℓwith Bℓ= Qℓ
k=1 Wk.
254

Then, it is tempting to directly apply LinTS to solve our problem. This approach will induce
255

higher regret because the additional uncertainty of the latent parameters is accounted for in Σ
256

despite integrating them. This causes the marginal action uncertainty Σ to be much higher than the
257

conditional action uncertainty σ2
1Id in (3.1), since we have Σ = σ2
1Id + PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1BℓB⊤
ℓ≽σ2
1Id.
258

This discrepancy leads to higher regret, especially when K is large. This is due to LinTS needing to
259

learn K independent d-dimensional parameters, each with a considerably higher initial covariance Σ.
260

This is also reflected by our regret bound. To simply comparisons, suppose that σ ≥maxℓ∈[L+1] σℓ
261

so that σ2
MAX ≤2. Then the regret bounds of dTS (where we bound σ2ℓ
MAX by 2ℓ) and LinTS read
262

dTS : ˜O
 q

n(dKσ2
1 + PL
ℓ=1 dℓσ2
ℓ+12ℓ)

,
LinTS : ˜O
 q

ndK(σ2
1 + PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1)

.

Then regret improvements are captured by the variances σℓand the sparsity dimensions dℓ, and we
263

proceed to illustrate this through the following scenarios.
264

(I) Decreasing variances. Assume that σℓ= 2ℓfor any ℓ∈[L + 1]. Then, the regrets become
265

dTS : ˜O
 q

n(dK + PL
ℓ=1 dℓ4ℓ))

,
LinTS : ˜O
 p

ndK2L)


Now to see the order of gain, assume the problem is high-dimensional (d ≫1), and set L = log2(d)
266

and dℓ= ⌊d

2ℓ⌋. Then the regret of dTS becomes ˜O
 p

nd(K + L))

, and hence the multiplicative
267

factor 2L in LinTS is removed and replaced with a smaller additive factor L.
268

(II) Constant variances. Assume that σℓ= 1 for any ℓ∈[L + 1]. Then, the regrets become
269

dTS : ˜O
 q

n(dK + PL
ℓ=1 dℓ2ℓ))

,
LinTS : ˜O
 p

ndKL)


Similarly, let L = log2(d), and dℓ= ⌊d

2ℓ⌋. Then dTS’s regret is ˜O
 p

nd(K + L)

. Thus the
270

multiplicative factor L in LinTS is removed and replaced with the additive factor L. By comparing
271

this to (I), the gain with decreasing variances is greater than with constant ones. In general, diffusion
272

models use decreasing variances [Ho et al., 2020] and hence we expect great gains in practice.
273

All observed improvements in this section could become even more pronounced when employing
274

non-linear diffusion models. In our current analysis, we used linear diffusion models, and yet we can
275

already discern substantial differences. Moreover, under non-linear diffusion (1), the latent parameters
276

cannot be analytically marginalized, making LinTS with exact marginalization inapplicable. Finally,
277

Appendix D.7 provide an additional comparison and connection to hierarchies with two levels.
278

Large action space aspect. dTS’s regret bound scales with Kσ2
1 instead of K P

ℓσ2
ℓ, particularly
279

beneficial when σ1 is small, as often seen in diffusion models. Our regret bound and experiments
280

show that dTS outperforms LinTS more distinctly when the action space becomes larger. Prior
281

studies [Foster et al., 2020, Xu and Zeevi, 2020, Zhu et al., 2022] proposed bandit algorithms that
282

do not scale with K. However, our setting differs significantly from theirs, explaining our inherent
283

dependency on K when σ1 > 0. Precisely, they assume a reward function of r(x, i; θ∗) = ϕ(x, i)⊤θ∗,
284

with a shared θ∗∈Rd and a known mapping ϕ. In contrast, we consider r(x, i; θ∗) = x⊤θ∗,i, with
285

θ∗= (θ∗,i)i∈[K] ∈RdK, requiring the learning of K separate d-dimensional action parameters.
286

In their setting, with the availability of ϕ, the regret of dTS would similarly be independent of
287

K. However, obtaining such a mapping ϕ can be challenging as it needs to encapsulate complex
288

context-action dependencies. Notably, our setting reflects a common practical scenario, such as in
289

recommendation systems where each product is often represented by its unique embedding.
290

5
Experiments
291

We evaluate dTS using synthetic data, to validate our theory and test dTS in large action spaces. We
292

omit semi-synthetic data [Riquelme et al., 2018] as they often result in small action spaces. This

choice is further justified by the fact that Hsieh et al. [2023] has already demonstrated the advantages
294

of diffusion models in multi-armed bandits using such data, without theoretical guarantees.
295

5.1
Settings and baselines
296

We run 50 random simulations and plot the average regret with its standard error. We consider both
297

linear and non-linear rewards. The distribution of linear rewards is P(· | x; θa) = N(x⊤θa, σ2) with
298

σ = 1. The non-linear rewards are binary and generated from P(· | x; θa) = Ber(g(x⊤θa))), where
299

g is the sigmoid function. The covariances are Σℓ= Id, and the context Xt is uniformly drawn from
300

[−1, 1]d. We vary d ∈{5, 20}, L ∈{2, 4} and K ∈{102, 104}. We set the horizon n = 5000.
301

Linear diffusion. We consider the linear diffusion model in (3.1) where score functions are linear as
302

fℓ(ψ) = Wℓψ where Wℓare uniformly drawn from [−1, 1]d×d. To introduce sparsity, we zero out
303

the last dℓcolumns of Wℓ, resulting in Wℓ= ( ¯Wℓ, 0d,d−dℓ), where (d1, d2) = (5, 2) when d = 5
304

and L = 2 and (d1, d2, d3, d4) = (20, 10, 5, 2) when d = 20 and L = 4.
305

Non-linear diffusion. We consider the general diffusion model in (1) with score functions fℓdefined
306

by two-layer neural networks with random weights in [−1, 1], ReLU activation, and a hidden layer
307

dimension of h = 20 when d = 5 and h = 60 when d = 20.
308

Baselines. When rewards are linear, we use LinUCB [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011], LinTS [Agrawal
309

and Goyal, 2013a], and HierTS [Hong et al., 2022b] that marginalizes out all latent parameters
310

except ψ∗,L. This corresponds to HierTS-1 in Appendix D.7. When rewards are non-linear, we
311

include UCB-GLM [Li et al., 2017], and GLM-TS [Chapelle and Li, 2012]. GLM-UCB [Filippi et al.,
312

2010] induced high regret while HierTS was designed for linear rewards only and thus both are not
313

included. We name dTS for each setting as dTS-dr, where the suffix d indicates the type of diffusion;
314

L for linear and N for non-linear. The suffix r indicates the type of rewards; L for linear and N for
315

non-linear. For instance, dTS-LL signifies dTS in linear diffusion (Section 3.1) with linear rewards.
316

5.2
Results and interpretations
317

Results are shown in Fig. 2 and we make the following observations:
318

1) dTS has better performance. dTS outperforms the baselines. First, when both the diffusion and
319

rewards are linear, dTS-LL consistently outperforms all baselines that disregard the latent structure
320

(LinTS and LinUCB) or incorporate it only partially (HierTS). Second, when the diffusion is linear
321

and rewards are non-linear, dTS-LN surpasses all baselines. Third, when the diffusion is non-linear
322

and rewards are linear, dTS-NL demonstrates significant performance gains compared to both LinTS
323

and LinUCB. With non-linear diffusion and rewards, dTS-NN surpasses both GLM-TS and UCB-GLM.
324

2) Latent diffusion structure may be more important than the reward distribution. When
325

rewards are non-linear (second and fourth columns in Fig. 2), we included variants of dTS that use
326

the correct diffusion prior but the wrong reward distribution, employing linear-Gaussian instead of
327

logistic-Bernoulli (dTS-LL in the second column and dTS-NL in the fourth column). In both cases,
328

despite the misspecification of the reward distribution, these variants outperform models that use the
329

correct reward distribution but neglect the latent diffusion structure, such as GLM-TS and UCB-GLM.
330

8


---Page Break---
This underscores the significance of accounting for the latent structure, which can sometimes be more
331

crucial than having an accurate reward distribution. Also, the performance gap between dTS-NL
332

(non-linear diffusion) and GLM-TS and UCB-GLM is even more pronounced compared to the gap
333

between dTS-LL (linear diffusion) and these baselines, possibly due to the increased complexity of
334

the latent structure, in the non-linear diffusion, overshadowing the impact of the reward model itself.

3) Prior misspecification (Fig. 3). We consider a scenario
336

where the prior used by dTS does not match the true prior.
337

To simulate this, we use our setting with linear diffusion
338

and rewards above, but the true parameters Wℓand Σℓare
339

replaced by misspecified parameters Wℓ+ ϵ1 and Σℓ+ ϵ2.
340

Here, ϵ1 and ϵ2 are sampled uniformly from [v, v+0.5]d×d,
341

with v controlling the level of misspecification. The higher
342

the value of v, the greater the misspecification. We vary
343

v ∈{0.5, 1, 1.5} and analyze its impact on dTS’s perfor-
344

mance. For comparison, we include the well-specified
345

dTS-LL and the most competitive baseline, HierTS. Re-
346

sults are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, dTS’s performance
347

decreases with increasing misspecification. However, even
348

with misspecification, dTS outperforms the most competitive baseline, except when v = 1.5, where

their performances are comparable. Note that the entries of the true parameters Wℓand Σℓare smaller
350

than 1, so values of v ∈{0.5, 1, 1.5} can lead to significant parameter misspecification. Yet, the
351

performance of dTS with misspecified prior parameters remains favorable, suggesting that even an
352

imperfect pre-trained diffusion model can be beneficial when used as prior.

4) Regret scaling with K, d and L matches our theory
354

(Fig. 4). We verify the impact of the number of actions
355

K, the context dimension d, and the diffusion depth L
356

on the regret of dTS. We maintain the same experimental
357

setup with linear diffusion and rewards, for which we have
358

derived a Bayes regret upper bound. In Fig. 4, we plot
359

the regret of dTS-LL across varying values of these pa-
360

rameters: K ∈{10, 100, 500, 1000}, d ∈{5, 10, 15, 20},
361

and L ∈{2, 4, 5, 6}. As anticipated and aligned with our
362

theory, the empirical regret increases as the values of K, d,
363

or L grow. This trend arises because larger values of K, d,
364

or L result in problem instances that are more challenging
365

to learn, consequently leading to higher regret.

Conclusion
375

Grappling with large action spaces in contextual bandits is challenging. Recognizing this, we focused
376

on structured problems where action parameters are sampled from a diffusion model; upon which we
377

built diffusion Thompson sampling (dTS). We developed both theoretical and algorithmic foundations
378

for dTS in numerous practical settings. We identified several directions for future work. Exploring
379

other approximations for non-linear diffusion models, both empirically and theoretically. From a
380

theoretical perspective, future research could explore the advantages of non-linear diffusion models
381

by deriving their Bayes regret bounds, akin to our analysis in Section 4. Empirically, investigating
382

our and other approximations in complex tasks would be interesting. Additionally, exploring the
383

extension of this work to offline (or off-policy) learning in contextual bandits [Swaminathan and
384

Joachims, 2015, Aouali et al., 2023a] represents a promising avenue for future research.

Thompson sampling (TS) operates within the Bayesian framework and it involves specifying a
534

prior/likelihood model. In each round, the agent samples unknown model parameters from the
535

current posterior distribution. The chosen action is the one that maximizes the resulting reward. TS
536

is naturally randomized, particularly simple to implement, and has highly competitive empirical
537

performance in both simulated and real-world problems [Russo and Van Roy, 2014, Chapelle and Li,
538

2012]. Regret guarantees for the TS heuristic remained open for decades even for simple models.
539

Recently, however, significant progress has been made. For standard multi-armed bandits, TS is
540

optimal in the Beta-Bernoulli model [Kaufmann et al., 2012, Agrawal and Goyal, 2013b], Gaussian-
541

Gaussian model [Agrawal and Goyal, 2013b], and in the exponential family using Jeffrey’s prior
542

[Korda et al., 2013]. For linear bandits, TS is nearly-optimal [Russo and Van Roy, 2014, Agrawal and
543

Goyal, 2017, Abeille and Lazaric, 2017]. In this work, we build TS upon complex diffusion priors
544

and analyze the resulting Bayes regret [Russo and Van Roy, 2014] in the linear contextual bandit
545

setting.
546

Decision-making with diffusion models gained attention recently, especially in offline learning
547

[Ajay et al., 2022, Janner et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2022]. However, their application in online
548

learning was only examined by Hsieh et al. [2023], which focused on meta-learning in multi-armed
549

bandits without theoretical guarantees. In this work, we expand the scope of Hsieh et al. [2023] to
550

encompass the broader contextual bandit framework. In particular, we provide theoretical analysis for
551

linear instances, effectively capturing the advantages of using diffusion models as priors in contextual
552

Thompson sampling. These linear cases are particularly captivating due to closed-form posteriors,
553

enabling both theoretical analysis and computational efficiency; an important practical consideration.
554

Hierarchical Bayesian bandits [Bastani et al., 2019, Kveton et al., 2021, Basu et al., 2021, Sim-
555

chowitz et al., 2021, Wan et al., 2021, Hong et al., 2022b, Peleg et al., 2022, Wan et al., 2022, Aouali
556

et al., 2023b] applied TS to simple graphical models, wherein action parameters are generally sampled
557

from a Gaussian distribution centered at a single latent parameter. These works mostly span meta-
558

and multi-task learning for multi-armed bandits, except in cases such as Aouali et al. [2023b], Hong
559

et al. [2022a] that consider the contextual bandit setting. Precisely, Aouali et al. [2023b] assume that
560

action parameters are sampled from a Gaussian distribution centered at a linear mixture of multiple
561

latent parameters. On the other hand, Hong et al. [2022a] applied TS to a graphical model represented
562

by a tree. Our work can be seen as an extension of all these works to much more complex graphical
563

models, for which both theoretical and algorithmic foundations are developed. Note that the settings
564

in most of these works can be recovered with specific choices of the diffusion depth L and functions
565

fℓ. This attests to the modeling power of dTS.
566

Approximate Thompson sampling is a major problem in the Bayesian inference literature. This is
567

because most posterior distributions are intractable, and thus practitioners must resort to sophisti-
568

cated computational techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo [Kruschke, 2010]. Prior works
569

[Riquelme et al., 2018, Chapelle and Li, 2012, Kveton et al., 2020] highlight the favorable empirical
570

performance of approximate Thompson sampling. Particularly, [Kveton et al., 2020] provide the-
571

oretical guarantees for Thompson sampling when using the Laplace approximation in generalized
572

linear bandits (GLB). In our context, we incorporate approximate sampling when the reward exhibits
573

non-linearity. While our approximation does not come with formal guarantees, it enjoys strong
574

practical performance. An in-depth analysis of this approximation is left as a direction for future
575

works. Similarly, approximating the posterior distribution when the diffusion model is non-linear as
576

well as analyzing it is an interesting direction of future works.
577

Bandits with underlying structure also align with our work, where we assume a structured relation-
578

ship among actions, captured by a diffusion model. In latent bandits [Maillard and Mannor, 2014,
579

Hong et al., 2020], a single latent variable indexes multiple candidate models. Within structured
580

14


---Page Break---
finite-armed bandits [Lattimore and Munos, 2014, Gupta et al., 2018], each action is linked to a known
581

mean function parameterized by a common latent parameter. This latent parameter is learned. TS
582

was also applied to complex structures [Yu et al., 2020, Gopalan et al., 2014]. However, simultaneous
583

computational and statistical efficiencies aren’t guaranteed. Meta- and multi-task learning with
584

upper confidence bound (UCB) approaches have a long history in bandits [Azar et al., 2013, Gentile
585

et al., 2014, Deshmukh et al., 2017, Cella et al., 2020]. These, however, often adopt a frequentist
586

perspective, analyze a stronger form of regret, and sometimes result in conservative algorithms.
587

In contrast, our approach is Bayesian, with analysis centered on Bayes regret. Remarkably, our
588

algorithm, dTS, performs well as analyzed without necessitating additional tuning. Finally, Low-rank
589

bandits [Hu et al., 2021, Cella et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2020] also relate to our linear diffusion model
590

when L = 1. Broadly, there exist two key distinctions between these prior works and the special
591

case of our model (linear diffusion model with L = 1). First, they assume θ∗,i = W1ψ∗,1, whereas
592

we incorporate additional uncertainty in the covariance Σ1 to account for possible misspecification
593

as θ∗,i = N(W1ψ∗,1, Σ1). Consequently, these algorithms might suffer linear regret due to model
594

misalignment. Second, we assume that the mixing matrix W1 is available and pre-learned offline,
595

whereas they learn it online. While this is more general, it leads to computationally expensive
596

methods that are difficult to employ in a real-world online setting.
597

Large action spaces. Roughly speaking, the regret bound of dTS scales with Kσ2
1 rather than
598

K P

ℓσ2
ℓ. This is particularly beneficial when σ1 is small, a common scenario in diffusion models
599

with decreasing variances. A notable case is when σ1 = 0, where the regret becomes independent of
600

K. Also, our analysis (Section 4.1) indicates that the gap in performance between dTS and LinTS
601

becomes more pronounced when the number of action increases, highlighting dTS’s suitability for
602

large action spaces. Note that some prior works [Foster et al., 2020, Xu and Zeevi, 2020, Zhu et al.,
603

2022] proposed bandit algorithms that do not scale with K. However, our setting differs significantly
604

from theirs, explaining our inherent dependency on K when σ1 > 0. Precisely, they assume a
605

reward function of r(x, i) = ϕ(x, i)⊤θ∗, with a shared θ∗∈Rd across actions and a known mapping
606

ϕ. In contrast, we consider r(x, i) = x⊤θ∗,i, requiring the learning of K separate d-dimensional
607

action parameters. In their setting, with the availability of ϕ, the regret of dTS would similarly be
608

independent of K. However, obtaining such a mapping ϕ can be challenging as it needs to encapsulate
609

complex context-action dependencies. Notably, our setting reflects a common practical scenario,
610

such as in recommendation systems where each product is often represented by its embedding. In
611

summary, the dependency on K is more related to our setting than the method itself, and dTS would
612

scale with d only in their setting. Note that dTS is both computationally and statistically efficient
613

(Section 4.1). This becomes particularly notable in large action spaces. Our empirical results in
614

Fig. 2, notably with K = 104, demonstrate that dTS significantly outperforms the baselines. More
615

importantly, the performance gap between dTS and these baselines is larger when the number of
616

actions (K) increases, highlighting the improved scalability of dTS to large action spaces.
617

Posterior derivations for linear diffusion models
618

Here, we assume the score functions fℓare linear such as fℓ(ψ∗,ℓ) = Wℓψ∗,ℓfor ℓ∈[L], where
619

Wℓ∈Rd×d are known mixing matrices. Then, (1) becomes a linear Gaussian system (LGS) [Bishop,
620

2006] and can be summarized as follows
621

ψ∗,L ∼N(0, ΣL+1) ,
(15)
ψ∗,ℓ−1 | ψ∗,ℓ∼N(Wℓψ∗,ℓ, Σℓ) ,
∀ℓ∈[L]/{1} ,
θ∗,i | ψ∗,1 ∼N(W1ψ∗,1, Σ1) ,
∀i ∈[K] ,
Yt | Xt, θ∗,At ∼P(· | Xt; θ∗,At) ,
∀t ∈[n] .

In this section, we derive the K +L posteriors Pt,i and Qt,ℓ, for which we provide the full expressions
622

in Appendix B.1. In our proofs, p(x) ∝f(x) means that the probability density p satisfies p(x) =
623

f(x)

Z
for any x ∈Rd, where Z is a normalization constant. In particular, we extensively use that if
624

p(x) ∝exp[−1

2x⊤Λx + x⊤m], where Λ is positive definite. Then p is the multivariate Gaussian
625

density with covariance Σ = Λ−1 and mean µ = Σm. These are standard notations and techniques
626

to manipulate Gaussian distributions [Koller and Friedman, 2009, Chapter 7].

B.1
Posterior expressions for linear diffusion models
628

Recall that we posit that the reward distribution is parameterized as a generalized linear model (GLM)
629

[McCullagh and Nelder, 1989], allowing for non-linear rewards. As a result, despite linearity in
630

score functions, the non-linearity in rewards makes it challenging to obtain closed-form posteriors.
631

However, since this non-linearity arises solely from the reward distribution, we approximate it using
632

a Gaussian distribution. This leads to efficient posterior approximations that are exact in cases where
633

the reward function is indeed Gaussian (a special case of the GLM model). Precisely, the reward
634

distribution P(· | x; θ) is an exponential-family distribution. Therefore, the log-likelihoods write
635

log P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) = P

k∈St,i YkX⊤
k θ −A(X⊤
k θ) + C(Yk), where C is a real function, and A
636

is a twice continuously differentiable function whose derivative is the mean function, ˙A = g. Now
637

we let ˆBt,i and ˆGt,i be the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the Hessian of the negative
638

log-likelihood, respectively, defined as
639

ˆBt,i = arg max

where St,i = {ℓ∈[t −1] : Aℓ= i} are the rounds where the agent takes action i up to round t.
640

Then we approximation the respective likelihood as P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) ≈N
 
θ; ˆBt,i, ˆG−1
t,i

. This
641

approximation makes all posteriors Gaussian. First, the conditional action-posterior reads Pt,i(· |

(17)

For ℓ∈[L]/{1}, the ℓ−1-th conditional latent-posterior is Qt,ℓ−1(· | ψℓ) = N(¯µt,ℓ−1, ¯Σt,ℓ−1),
644

¯Σ−1

645

¯Σ−1
t,L = Σ−1
L+1 + ¯Gt,L ,
¯µt,L = ¯Σt,L ¯Bt,L .
(19)

Finally, ¯Gt,ℓand ¯Bt,ℓfor ℓ∈[L] are computed recursively. The basis of the recursion are

This concludes the derivation of our posterior approximation. Note that these approximations are exact
648

when the reward distribution follows a linear-Gaussian model, P(· | x; θ∗,a) = N(·; x⊤θ∗,a, σ2).
649

B.2
Derivation of Action-Posteriors for Linear Diffusion Models

To simplify derivations, we consider the case where the reward distribution is indeed linear-
651

Gaussian as P(· | Xt; θ∗,At) = N
 
X⊤
t θ∗,At, σ2
, but the same derivations can be applied when
652

the rewards are non-linear. In this case, the likelihood approximation in (16) becomes exact as
653

we have that P (Ht,i | θ∗,i = θ) ∝N
 
θ; ˆBt,i, ˆG−1


, where ˆBt,i is the corresponding MLE and
654

ˆGt,i = σ−2 P

k∈St,i XkX⊤
k in this case. Our derivations rely on the fact that the MLE ˆBt,i in this
655

linear-Gaussian case satisfies: ˆGt,i ˆBt,i = v P

k∈St,i XkY ⊤
k .
656

Proposition B.1. Consider the following model, which corresponds to the last two layers in Eq. (15)
657

θ∗,i | ψ∗,1 ∼N (W1ψ∗,1, Σ1) ,

Yt | Xt, θ∗,At ∼N
 
X⊤
t θ∗,At, σ2
,
∀t ∈[n] .

Then we have that for any t ∈[n] and i ∈[K], Pt,i(θ | ψ1) = P (θ∗,i = θ | ψ∗,1 = ψ1, Ht,i) =
658

N(θ; ˆµt,i, ˆΣt,i), where

Proof. Let v = σ−2 ,

Pt,i(θ | ψ1) = P (θ∗,i = θ | ψ∗,1 = ψ1, Ht,i) ,

Proposition B.2. For any ℓ∈[L]/{1}, the ℓ−1-th conditional latent-posterior reads Qt,ℓ−1(· |

¯µt,L = ¯Σt,L ¯Bt,L .
(23)

Proof. Let ℓ∈[L]/{1}. Then, Bayes rule yields that
674

Qt,ℓ−1(ψℓ−1 | ψℓ) ∝P (Ht | ψ∗,ℓ−1 = ψℓ−1) N(ψℓ−1, Wℓψℓ, Σℓ) ,

. Using this approximation in the derivations

C
Posterior derivations for non-linear diffusion models
712

After deriving the posteriors for linear score functions fℓ, we now get back to the general case in (1),
713

where the score functions are potentially non-linear. Approximation is needed since both the score
714

functions and rewards can be non-linear. To avoid any computational challenges, we use a simple
715

and intuitive approximation, where all posteriors Pt,i and Qt,ℓare approximated by the Gaussian
716

distributions in Appendix B.1, with few changes. First, the terms Wℓψℓin (18) are replaced by fℓ(ψℓ).
717

This accounts for the fact that the prior mean is now fℓ(ψℓ) rather than Wℓψℓ, and this is the main
718

difference between the linear diffusion model in (15) and the general, potentially non-linear, diffusion
719

model in (1). Second, the matrix multiplications that involve the matrices Wℓin (20) and (21) are
720

simply removed. Despite being simple, this approximation is efficient and avoids the computational
721

burden of heavy approximate sampling algorithms required for each latent parameter. This is why
722

deriving the exact posterior for linear score functions was key beyond enabling theoretical analyses.
723

Moreover, this approximation retains some key attributes of exact posteriors. Specifically, in the
724

absence of data, it recovers precisely the prior in (1), and as more data is accumulated, the influence
725

of the prior diminishes.

Regret proof and additional discussions
727

D.1
Sketch of the proof
728

We start with the following standard lemma upon which we build our analysis [Aouali et al., 2023b].
729

Lemma D.1. Assume that P (θ∗,i = θ | Ht) = N(θ; ˇµt,i, ˇΣt,i) for any i ∈[K], then for any δ ∈
730

hPn
t=1 ∥Xt∥2
ˇΣt,At

i
+ cnδ ,
where c > 0 is a constant .
(28)

Applying Lemma D.1 requires proving that the marginal action-posteriors P (θ∗,i = θ | Ht) in Eq. (3)
732

are Gaussian and computing their covariances, while we only know the conditional action-posteriors
733

Pt,i and latent-posteriors Qt,ℓ. This is achieved by leveraging the preservation properties of the
734

family of Gaussian distributions [Koller and Friedman, 2009] and the total covariance decomposition
735

[Weiss, 2005] which leads to the next lemma.
736

21


---Page Break---
Lemma D.2. Let t ∈[n] and i ∈[K], then the marginal covariance matrix ˇΣt,i reads
737

ˇΣt,i = ˆΣt,i + P
ℓ∈[L] Pi,ℓ¯Σt,ℓP⊤
i,ℓ,
where Pi,ℓ= ˆΣt,iΣ−1

Qℓ−1
k=1 ¯Σt,kΣ−1
k+1Wk+1.
(29)

The marginal covariance matrix ˇΣt,i in Eq. (29) decomposes into L + 1 terms. The first term
738

corresponds to the posterior uncertainty of θ∗,i | ψ∗,1. The remaining L terms capture the posterior
739

uncertainties of ψ∗,L and ψ∗,ℓ−1 | ψ∗,ℓfor ℓ∈[L]/{1}. These are then used to quantify the posterior
740

information gain of latent parameters after one round as follows.
741

Lemma D.3 (Posterior information gain). Let t ∈[n] and ℓ∈[L], then

(30)

Finally, Lemma D.2 is used to decompose ∥Xt∥2
ˇΣt,At in Eq. (28) into L + 1 terms. Each term is
743

bounded thanks to Lemma D.3. This results in the Bayes regret bound in Theorem 4.1.
744

D.2
Technical contributions
745

Our main technical contributions are the following.
746

Lemma D.2. In dTS, sampling is done hierarchically, meaning the marginal posterior distribution of
747

θ∗,i|Ht is not explicitly defined. Instead, we use the conditional posterior distribution of θ∗,i|Ht, ψ∗,1.
748

The first contribution was deriving θ∗,i|Ht using the total covariance decomposition combined with
749

an induction proof, as our posteriors in Section 3.1 were derived recursively. Unlike in Bayes
750

regret analysis for standard Thompson sampling, where the posterior distribution of θ∗,i|Ht is
751

predetermined due to the absence of latent parameters, our method necessitates this recursive total
752

covariance decomposition, marking a first difference from the standard Bayesian proofs of Thompson
753

sampling. Note that HierTS, which is developed for multi-task linear bandits, also employs total
754

covariance decomposition, but it does so under the assumption of a single latent parameter; on which
755

action parameters are centered. Our extension significantly differs as it is tailored for contextual
756

bandits with multiple, successive levels of latent parameters, moving away from HierTS’s assumption
757

of a 1-level structure. Roughly speaking, HierTS when applied to contextual would consider a single-
758

level hierarchy, where θ∗,i|ψ∗,1 ∼N(ψ∗,1, Σ1) with L = 1. In contrast, our model proposes a
759

multi-level hierarchy, where the first level is θ∗,i|ψ∗,1 ∼N(W1ψ∗,1, Σ1). This also introduces a new
760

aspect to our approach – the use of a linear function W1ψ∗,1, as opposed to HierTS’s assumption
761

where action parameters are centered directly on the latent parameter. Thus, while HierTS also
762

uses the total covariance decomposition, our generalize it to multi-level hierarchies under L linear
763

functions Wℓψ∗,ℓ, instead of a single-level hierarchy under a single identity function ψ∗,1.
764

Lemma D.3. In Bayes regret proofs for standard Thompson sampling, we often quantify the posterior
765

information gain. This is achieved by monitoring the increase in posterior precision for the action
766

taken At in each round t ∈[n]. However, in dTS, our analysis extends beyond this. We not only
767

quantify the posterior information gain for the taken action but also for every latent parameter, since
768

they are also learned. This lemma addresses this aspect. To elaborate, we use the recursive formulas
769

in Section 3.1 that connect the posterior covariance of each latent parameter ψ∗,ℓwith the covariance
770

of the posterior action parameters θ∗,i. This allows us to propagate the information gain associated
771

with the action taken in round At to all latent parameters ψ∗,ℓ, for ℓ∈[L] by induction. This is a
772

novel contribution, as it is not a feature of Bayes regret analyses in standard Thompson sampling.
773

Proposition 4.2. Building upon the insights of Theorem 4.1, we introduce the sparsity assumption
774

(A3). Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the Bayes regret outlined in Theorem 4.1 can be
775

significantly refined. Specifically, the regret becomes contingent on dimensions dℓ≤d, as opposed
776

to relying on the entire dimension d. This sparsity assumption is both a novel and a key technical
777

contribution to our work. Its underlying principle is straightforward: the Bayes regret is influenced
778

by the quantity of parameters that require learning. With the sparsity assumption, this number is
779

reduced to less than d for each latent parameter. To substantiate this claim, we revisit the proof of
780

Theorem 4.1 and modify a crucial equality. This adjustment results in a more precise representation by
781

partitioning the covariance matrix of each latent parameter ψ∗,ℓinto blocks. These blocks comprise
782

a dℓ× dℓsegment corresponding to the learnable dℓparameters of ψ∗,ℓ, and another block of size
783

(d −dℓ) × (d −dℓ) that does not necessitate learning. This decomposition allows us to conclude that
784

the final regret is solely dependent on dℓ, marking a significant refinement from the original theorem.
785

D.3
Proof of lemma D.2
786

In this proof, we heavily rely on the total covariance decomposition [Weiss, 2005]. Also, refer to
787

[Hong et al., 2022b, Section 5.2] for a brief introduction to this decomposition. Now, from Eq. (17),
788

we have that

First, given Ht, cov [θ∗,i | Ht, ψ∗,1] =

where ¯¯Σt,1 = cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht] is the marginal posterior covariance of ψ∗,1. Finally, the total covariance
792

decomposition [Weiss, 2005, Hong et al., 2022b] yields that
793

ˇΣt,i = cov [θ∗,i | Ht] = E [cov [θ∗,i | Ht, ψ∗,1] | Ht] + cov [E [θ∗,i | Ht, ψ∗,1] | Ht] ,

However, ¯¯Σt,1 = cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht] is different from ¯Σt,1 = cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] that we already derived
794

in Eq. (18). Thus we do not know the expression of ¯¯Σt,1. But we can use the same total covariance
795

decomposition trick to find it. Precisely, let ¯¯Σt,ℓ= cov [ψ∗,ℓ| Ht] for any ℓ∈[L]. Then we have that

797

E [cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] | Ht] = cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] = ¯Σt,1 .

In addition, given Ht, ¯Σt,1, ˜Σt,1 and ¯Bt,1 are constant. Thus

cov [E [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] | Ht] = cov

Finally, total covariance decomposition [Weiss, 2005, Hong et al., 2022b] leads to

¯¯Σt,1 = cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht] = E [cov [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] | Ht] + cov [E [ψ∗,1 | Ht, ψ∗,2] | Ht] ,

Proof of lemma D.3

We prove this result by induction. We start with the base case when ℓ= 1.

(32)

In (i) we use the Sherman-Morrison formula. Note that (ii) says that ¯Σ−1
t+1,1 −¯Σ−1
t,1 is one-rank
808

which we will also need in induction step. Now, we have that ∥Xt∥2 = 1. Therefore,
809

1 + u⊤u = 1 + σ−2X⊤
t ˆΣt,AtXt ≤1 + σ−2λ1(Σ1)∥Xt∥2 = 1 + σ−2σ2
1 ≤σ2
MAX ,

where we use that by definition of σ2
MAX in Lemma D.3, we have that σ2
MAX ≥1 + σ−2σ2
1. Therefore,
810

by taking the inverse, we get that
1
1+u⊤u ≥σ−2
MAX. Combining this with Eq. (32) leads to
811

Noticing that PAt,1 = ˆΣt,AtΣ−1
1 W1 concludes the proof of the base case when ℓ= 1.
812

(II) Induction step. Let ℓ∈[L]/{1} and suppose that ¯Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−1 −¯Σ−1
t,ℓ−1 is one-rank and that it
813

holds for ℓ−1 that
814

¯Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−1 −¯Σ−1
t,ℓ−1 ⪰σ−2σ−2(ℓ−1)
MAX
P⊤
At,ℓ−1XtX⊤
t PAt,ℓ−1 ,
where σ−2
MAX = max
ℓ∈[L] 1 + σ−2σ2
ℓ.

Then, we want to show that ¯Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−¯Σ−1
t,ℓis also one-rank and that it holds that
815

¯Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−¯Σ−1

MAXP⊤

where σ−2

This is achieved as follows. First, we notice that by the induction hypothesis, we have that ˜Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−1 −
816

¯Gt,ℓ−1 = ¯Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−1 −¯Σ−1
t,ℓ−1 is one-rank. In addition, the matrix is positive semi-definite. Thus we
817

can write it as ˜Σ−1
t+1,ℓ−1 −¯Gt,ℓ−1 = uu⊤where u ∈Rd. Then, similarly to the base case, we have

Finally, we use that 1 + u⊤¯Σt,ℓ−1u ≤1 + ∥u∥2λ1(¯Σt,ℓ−1) ≤1 + σ−2σ2
ℓ. Here we use that
821

∥u∥2 ≤σ−2, which can also be proven by induction, and that λ1(¯Σt,ℓ−1) ≤σ2
ℓ, which follows from
822

the expression of ¯Σt,ℓ−1 in Section 3.1. Therefore, we have that

824

the proof.

Then we use Lemma D.2 and express the marginal covariance ˇΣt,At as
829

ˇΣt,i = ˆΣt,i +

,
cℓ=

, with the convention that σL+1 = 1 .

The derivation of c0 uses that
833

d (Σ−1

Proof of proposition 4.2
854

We use exactly the same proof in Appendix D.5, with one change to account for the sparsity
855

assumption (A3). The change corresponds to Eq. (38). First, recall that Eq. (38) writes

our assumption, (A3), we assume that Wℓ= ( ¯Wℓ, 0d,d−dℓ), where ¯Wℓ∈Rd×dℓfor any ℓ∈[L].
859

To get the last inequality, we use derivations similar to the ones we used in Eq. (40). Finally, the

Additional discussion: link to two-level hierarchies
868

The linear diffusion (15) can be marginalized into a 2-level hierarchy using two different strategies.
869

The first one yields,
870

ψ∗,L ∼N(0, σ2
L+1BLB⊤
L) ,
(45)
θ∗,i | ψ∗,L ∼N(ψ∗,L, Ω1) ,
∀i ∈[K] ,

with Ω1 = σ2
1Id + PL−1
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1BℓB⊤
ℓand Bℓ= Qℓ
k=1 Wk. The second strategy yields,
871

ψ∗,1 ∼N(0, Ω2) ,
(46)

θ∗,i | ψ∗,1 ∼N(ψ∗,1, σ2
1Id) ,
∀i ∈[K] ,

where Ω2 = PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1BℓB⊤
ℓ. Recently, HierTS [Hong et al., 2022b] was developed for such
872

two-level graphical models, and we call HierTS under (45) by HierTS-1 and HierTS under (46)
873

by HierTS-2. Then, we start by highlighting the differences between these two variants of HierTS.
874

First, their regret bounds scale as
875

HierTS-1 : ˜O
 q

nd(K PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+ Lσ2
L+1

,
HierTS-2 : ˜O
 q

nd(Kσ2
1 + PL
ℓ=1 σ2
ℓ+1)

.

When K ≈L, the regret bounds of HierTS-1 and HierTS-2 are similar. However, when K > L,
876

HierTS-2 outperforms HierTS-1. This is because HierTS-2 puts more uncertainty on a single
877

d-dimensional latent parameter ψ∗,1, rather than K individual d-dimensional action parameters
878

θ∗,i. More importantly, HierTS-1 implicitly assumes that action parameters θ∗,i are conditionally
879

independent given ψ∗,L, which is not true. Consequently, HierTS-2 outperforms HierTS-1. Note
880

that, under the linear diffusion model (15), dTS and HierTS-2 have roughly similar regret bounds.
881

Specifically, their regret bounds dependency on K is identical, where both methods involve mul-
882

tiplying K by σ2
1, and both enjoy improved performance compared to HierTS-1. That said, note
883

that Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 provide an understanding of how dTS’s regret scales under
884

linear score functions fℓ, and do not say that using dTS is better than using HierTS when the score
885

functions fℓare linear since the latter can be obtained by a proper marginalization of latent parameters
886

(i.e., HierTS-2 instead of HierTS-1). While such a comparison is not the goal of this work, we still
887

provide it for completeness next.
888

When the mixing matrices Wℓare dense (i.e., assumption (A3) is not applicable), dTS and HierTS-2
889

have comparable regret bounds and computational efficiency. However, under the sparsity assumption
890

(A3) and with mixing matrices that allow for conditional independence of ψ∗,1 coordinates given
891

ψ∗,2, dTS enjoys a computational advantage over HierTS-2. This advantage explains why works
892

focusing on multi-level hierarchies typically benchmark their algorithms against two-level structures
893

akin to HierTS-1, rather than the more competitive HierTS-2. This is also consistent with prior
894

works in Bayesian bandits using multi-level hierarchies, such as Tree-based priors [Hong et al.,
895

2022a], which compared their method to HierTS-1. In line with this, we also compared dTS with
896

HierTS-1 in our experiments. But this is only given for completeness as this is not the aim of
897

Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2. More importantly, HierTS is inapplicable in the general case in (1)
898

with non-linear score functions since the latent parameters cannot be analytically marginalized.
899

E
Broader impact
900

This work contributes to the development and analysis of practical algorithms for online learning to
901

act under uncertainty. While our generic setting and algorithms have broad potential applications,
902

the specific downstream social impacts are inherently dependent on the chosen application domain.
903

Nevertheless, we acknowledge the crucial need to consider potential biases that may be present in
904

pre-trained diffusion models, given that our method relies on them.
905

F
Limitations
906

Our work investigated contextual bandits, laying the groundwork for future exploration into reinforce-
907

ment learning. This exploration can be done from both practical (empirical) and theoretical angles.
908

While our method, which approximates rewards using a Gaussian distribution, worked well for linear
909

rewards and those following a generalized linear model, its effectiveness in real-world, complex
910

scenarios needs further testing. Another interesting direction for future research is pre-training the
911

diffusion model prior. Hsieh et al. [2023] proposed a method for this in multi-armed bandits, but its
912

application to contextual bandits remains unexplored.
913

G
Amount of computation required
914

Our experiments were conducted on internal machines with 30 CPUs and thus they required a moder-
915

ate amount of computation. These experiments are also reproducible with minimal computational
916

resources.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
918

1. Claims
919

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
920

paper’s contributions and scope?
921

Answer: [Yes]
922

Justification: All claims are supported by the theory in Section 4 (with proofs provided in
923

the appendix) and experiments in Section 5.
924

Guidelines:
925

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
926

made in the paper.
927

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
928

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
929

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
930

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
931

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
932

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
933

are not attained by the paper.
934

2. Limitations
935

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
936

Answer: [Yes]
937

Justification: Limitations were discussed in Section 6 and Appendix F.
938

Guidelines:
939

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
940

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
941

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
942

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
943

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
944

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
945

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
946

implications would be.
947

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
948

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
949

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
950

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
951

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
952

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
953

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
954

technical jargon.
955

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
956

and how they scale with dataset size.
957

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
958

address problems of privacy and fairness.
959

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
960

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
961

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
962

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
963

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
964

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
965

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
966

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
967

a complete (and correct) proof?
968

Answer: [Yes]
969

31


---Page Break---
Justification: Assumptions are mentioned in the main text. Complete proofs are provided in
970

the appendix.
971

Guidelines:
972

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
973

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
974

referenced.
975

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
976

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
977

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
978

proof sketch to provide intuition.
979

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
980

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
981

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
982

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
983

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
984

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
985

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
986

Answer: [Yes]
987

Justification: Information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper is
988

described in Section 5.
989

Guidelines:
990

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
991

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
992

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
993

whether the code and data are provided or not.
994

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
995

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
996

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
997

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
998

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
999

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
1000

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
1001

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
1002

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
1003

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
1004

appropriate to the research performed.
1005

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
1006

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
1007

nature of the contribution. For example
1008

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
1009

to reproduce that algorithm.
1010

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
1011

the architecture clearly and fully.
1012

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
1013

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
1014

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
1015

the dataset).
1016

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
1017

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
1018

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
1019

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
1020

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
1021

5. Open access to data and code
1022

32


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
1023

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
1024

material?
1025

Answer: [Yes]
1026

Justification: The code for the main experiments is shared in the supplementary material.
1027

Guidelines:
1028

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
1029

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
1030

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
1031

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
1032

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
1033

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
1034

benchmark).
1035

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
1036

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
1037

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
1038

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
1039

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
1040

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
1041

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
1042

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
1043

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
1044

versions (if applicable).
1045

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
1046

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
1047

6. Experimental Setting/Details
1048

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
1049

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
1050

results?
1051

Answer: [Yes]
1052

Justification: All experimental details are described in Section 5.
1053

Guidelines:
1054

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1055

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
1056

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
1057

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
1058

material.
1059

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
1060

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
1061

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
1062

Answer: [Yes]
1063

Justification: Standard error bars are included in the figures.
1064

Guidelines:
1065

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1066

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
1067

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
1068

the main claims of the paper.
1069

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
1070

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
1071

run with given experimental conditions).
1072

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
1073

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
1074

33


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
1075

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
1076

of the mean.
1077

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
1078

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
1079

of Normality of errors is not verified.
1080

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
1081

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
1082

error rates).
1083

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
1084

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
1085

8. Experiments Compute Resources
1086

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
1087

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
1088

the experiments?
1089

Answer: [Yes]
1090

Justification: As mentioned in Appendix G, our experiments were conducted on internal
1091

machines with 30 CPUs and thus they required a moderate amount of computation. These
1092

experiments are also reproducible with minimal computational resources.
1093

Guidelines:
1094

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1095

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
1096

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
1097

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
1098

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
1099

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
1100

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
1101

didn’t make it into the paper).
1102

9. Code Of Ethics
1103

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
1104

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
1105

Answer: [Yes]
1106

Justification: This work contributes to the development and theoretical analysis of online
1107

learning to act under uncertainty and it adheres to the Neurips Code Of Ethics.
1108

Guidelines:
1109

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
1110

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
1111

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
1112

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
1113

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
1114

10. Broader Impacts
1115

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
1116

societal impacts of the work performed?
1117

Answer: [Yes]
1118

Justification: Broader Impacts are discussed in Appendix E.
1119

Guidelines:
1120

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
1121

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
1122

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
1123

34


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
1124

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
1125

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
1126

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
1127

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
1128

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
1129

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
1130

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
1131

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
1132

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
1133

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
1134

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
1135

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
1136

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
1137

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
1138

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
1139

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
1140

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
1141

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
1142

11. Safeguards
1143

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
1144

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
1145

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
1146

Answer: [NA]
1147

Justification: Our paper is mainly theoretical and the used data is simulated. Thus, we
1148

believe that our work poses no such risks.
1149

Guidelines:
1150

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
1151

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
1152

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
1153

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
1154

safety filters.
1155

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
1156

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
1157

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
1158

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
1159

faith effort.
1160

12. Licenses for existing assets
1161

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
1162

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
1163

properly respected?
1164

Answer: [Yes]
1165

Justification: To the best of our knowledge, all relevant and used papers were cited.
1166

Guidelines:
1167

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
1168

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
1169

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
1170

URL.
1171

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
1172

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
1173

service of that source should be provided.
1174

35


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
1175

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
1176

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
1177

license of a dataset.
1178

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
1179

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
1180

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
1181

the asset’s creators.
1182

13. New Assets
1183

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
1184

provided alongside the assets?
1185

Answer: [Yes]
1186

Justification: We include our code as supplementary material, with all details needed for
1187

reproducibility given in Section 5.
1188

Guidelines:
1189

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
1190

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
1191

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
1192

limitations, etc.
1193

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
1194

asset is used.
1195

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
1196

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
1197

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
1198

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
1199

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
1200

well as details about compensation (if any)?
1201

Answer: [NA]
1202

Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
1203

Guidelines:
1204

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
1205

human subjects.
1206

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
1207

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
1208

included in the main paper.
1209

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
1210

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
1211

collector.
1212

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
1213

Subjects
1214

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
1215

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
1216

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
1217

institution) were obtained?
1218

Answer: [NA]
1219

Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
1220

Guidelines:
1221

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
1222

human subjects.
1223

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
1224

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
1225

should clearly state this in the paper.
1226

36


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
1227

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
1228

guidelines for their institution.
1229

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
1230

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
