Abstract

Medical imaging tasks require an understanding of subtle and localized visual
features due to the inherently detailed and area-specific nature of pathological
patterns, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. Although recent advances in
medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) enable models to learn clinically rel-
evant visual features by leveraging both medical images and their associated radi-
ology reports, current medical VLP methods primarily focus on aligning images
with entire reports. This focus hinders the learning of dense (pixel-level) visual
features and is suboptimal for dense prediction tasks (e.g., medical image segmen-
tation). To address this challenge, we propose a novel medical VLP framework,
named Global to Dense level representation learning (G2D), which aims to learn
global and dense visual features simultaneously using only image-text pairs with-
out extra annotations. In particular, G2D designs a Pseudo Segmentation (PS)
task, which enables the model to learn dense visual features during VLP. Notably,
generating PS masks can be performed on the fly during VLP, which does not incur
extra trainable parameters. With this simple yet effective idea, G2D achieves su-
perior performance across 5 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases. Particularly,
in the segmentation task which requires dense visual features, G2D surpasses ex-
isting models even with just 1% of the training data for finetuning, compared to
100% used by other models. The code can be found in https://github.com/cheliu-
computation/G2D-NeurIPS24/tree/main.

Introduction

In medical image analysis, learning global and dense visual representations typically requires labor-
intensive and costly image and pixel-level annotations [1, 2]. Vision-language pre-training (VLP)
attempts addressing this by aligning vision and language content using paired datasets [3, 4, 5, 6].
Although existing medical VLP methods excel at learning global visual features [7], they face chal-
lenges with dense visual features because the level of detail in text reports does not offer sufficient

pixel-level supervision for learning these more detailed aspects. Existing medical VLP methods are
categorized into two main types, as shown in Fig. 1:

• Alignment-based Approaches, which focus on aligning images with reports [4, 8, 9, 5, 6,
2, 10]. Although methods like [4, 8, 9] align images with entire reports and text tokens,
they struggle to learn dense, clinically relevant visual features. This is due to the ambigu-
ous supervision targets provided by text tokens, which lack explicit relational pairing with
image regions, as discussed in [2].

• Reconstruction-based Approaches,
which learn representations by reconstructing
masked images or reports using masked modeling techniques [11, 12]. However, they also
lack success in capturing dense, clinically relevant visual features, as the reconstruction
task primarily focuses on low-level patterns (texture, shape) rather than high-level seman-
tics [13].
Despite advancements in medical VLP, limitations still exist. Current alignment approaches align
image patches with text tokens in a brute-force manner and possibly cause misalignments when
some word tokens (e.g., ‘compatible’ or ‘unremarkable’) lack direct visual counterparts, leading to
ambiguous local alignments. Meanwhile, reconstruction-based approaches may ignore high-level
image semantics. They are designed to recover low-level visual information such as intensity and
texture, without accounting for high-level semantics [14, 13, 15]. As a result, both approaches
perform suboptimally for downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and visual grounding,
which require learning of granular visual features that are aligned with high-level semantics.

While numerous VLP methods are designed to capture dense visual features for natural image
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) they often struggle to transfer directly to medical images because they
depend on a well-trained object detection model [16, 17] or a well-aligned VLP model [18, 19]. In
the medical domain, obtaining such pre-trained models is difficult as objects can be defined in var-
ious ways within a single medical image (e.g., based on organs, anatomical structures, or abnormal
regions) . Additionally, in medical domain, there is a lack of foundational VLP models that are both
publicly accessible and are trained on sufficiently large image-text pairs that cover diverse medical
imaging applications.

In response to the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a novel medical VLP approach termed
G2D. This approach is designed to extract global and dense visual representations from radiography
along with their associated radiology reports, with improved feature granularity and enriched se-
mantic information. Central to our approach is a pretext task, Pseudo Segmentation (PS), which is
guided by a pseudo mask (segmentation target) derived from a carefully refined and filtered attention
map. PS encourages the model to learn dense representations through a pixel-level pretext task that
incorporates high-level semantics. This approach, in contrast to traditional methods that align image
patches with text tokens, inherently mitigates the misalignment bias and allows learning of more
representative features. Notably, the PS pretext task can be implemented to run concurrently with
vision-language alignment, ensuring that the model can be trained end-to-end, contrasting with the
two-stage training methods [18].

To evaluate the effectiveness of G2D relative to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLP approaches, we
deploy the pre-trained model across a diverse range of downstream tasks, including medical image
classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, as well as zero-shot image classification and

visual grounding, on six public large-scale CXR datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of G2D over existing VLP approaches on these medical applications. Overall,
our contribution is three-fold:

1. We introduce G2D, the first end-to-end encoder-decoder medical VLP approach designed
to learn visual representations from the global level down to the dense level, supervised by
paired radiology reports and a pixel-wise pretext task.

2. We carefully design a pretext task tailored for medical VLP, pseudo segmentation. It formu-
lates a pseudo mask as segmentation target, allowing the model to learn dense visual repre-
sentations in the pretext task which can benefit downstream dense visual tasks in medicine.
The pseudo mask can be generated using a parameter-free processor that leverages the at-
tention map derived from the visual representation associated with radiology reports.

3. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the efficacy of the proposed G2D ap-
proach, which outperforms peer approaches across five uni-modal and cross-modal down-
stream tasks.

Alignment-based Medical VLP. Drawing inspiration from [3], aligning images with their corre-
sponding textual descriptions in the latent space has led to notable advancements in VLP. Within
the CXR domain, while ConVIRT [4] made an early attempt at employing bidirectional contrastive
learning to globally align entire images with their paired reports, there remained room for refine-
ment. GLoRIA [8] and MGCA [9] represent advancements in image-report alignment, introducing
sophisticated global-local methodologies to the field [8, 9]. These approaches endeavor to estab-
lish correspondences between distinct image and text tokens. However, it is crucial to recognize
that the granularity of token-level alignment could inadvertently introduce distortions to the medi-
cal context, potentially leading to misalignments, as illustrated by [20, 2]. Med-UniC [20] utilizes
augmented text in VLP training to cultivate language invariance, with the goal of mitigating lin-
guistic biases from VLP. Meanwhile, MedKLIP [5] and KAD [21] harness domain-specific knowl-
edge from external annotated datasets to enhance textual information extraction. Notably, these
approaches [20, 5, 21] are contingent upon external resources or extra data to optimize cross-modal
representation learning, which could potentially constrain their generalizability.

Reconstruction-based Medical VLP. Several studies, including [12, 11, 22], have employed recon-
struction of image and text tokens as a pretext task within VLP. Specifically, MRM [12] endeavors
to reconstruct the original image from a masked version and simultaneously aims to regenerate the
original text using both the masked image and text as inputs. Conversely, PRIOR [11] adopts a
strategy that focuses on cross-modal representation by reconstructing images and sentences based
on complete image and report inputs. An enhancement to the MRM [12] approach is proposed by
[22], where token weights are adjusted during the reconstruction phase.

While these methods have demonstrated promising outcomes, the ability of the reconstruction pre-
text task to capture high-level semantic representations is limited, as shown in [14, 15, 13], and is
further challenged by the absence of explicit semantic-related constraints in dense visual represen-
tation learning.

Methodology

The central aim of G2D is to learn global and dense visual representations from medical images
under the supervision of their corresponding radiology reports. As illustrated in Fig 2 Left, G2D
integrates two alignment strategies: vision-language alignment (VLA) that learns global represen-
tations, and pixel alignment (PA) that focuses on granular representation via a pixel-level pretext
task, Pseudo Segmentation (PS). The pseudo mask for PS is constructed through a parameter-free
mechanism, which is operated alongside VLA. The PS pretext task enables G2D to derive dense
representations at both encoder and decoder levels during pre-training. Moreover, the task head of
the pretext task facilitates a smoother transfer for the pre-trained encoder to be applied to down-
stream segmentation tasks, reducing the gap between the dense visual representation learned from
VLP and the needs of downstream dense visual tasks after VLP. This contrasts with previous meth-

ods [4, 8, 9, 21, 5, 6] that typically transfer only the pre-trained encoder, potentially leading to an
information gap between the pre-training and downstream tasks.

3.1
Vision-Language Contrastive Learning

We utilise a dual-encoder image-text contrastive approach following [4, 8, 9, 5]. Given a training set
S consisting of N pairs of image-text (vi, li), where vi ∈V denotes an image and li ∈L denotes
a text report, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N, G2D employs an image encoder Fe : V 7→RDv to encode the
image into an embedding of dimension Dv, and a text encoder Fl : L 7→RDl to encode the text
report into an embedding of dimension Dl. The embedded image and text features can be denoted
as S = {(v1, l1) , (v2, l2) , . . . , (vN, lN)}, where vi = Fe(vi) and li = Fl(li).

As depicted in Fig. 2, G2D incorporates two alignment strategies: VLA and PA. For VLA, the
model aims to learn global visual and text representations by pulling the embeddings of paired
image-report samples closer, while distancing embeddings of unpaired samples, using a contrastive
loss LVLA. The objective of contrastive learning is to predict N positive matched pairs (vi, li) and
N 2 −N negative pairs among N ×N possible image-text pair combinations [3]. Subsequently, two
non-linear vision and language projectors Pv and Pl transform vi and li into the same dimension d,
where ˆvi = Pv(vi),ˆli = Pl(li), and ˆvi,ˆli ∈Rd. After obtaining image feature vectors [ˆvi]N
i=1 and
text feature vectors [ˆli]N
i=1 with the same dimension d, the contrastive loss LVLA can be formulated

3.2
Pseudo Segmentation Mask Construction

Notably, although MedSAM [23] claims to build image-mask pairs, it requires box prompt inputs not
available in the MIMIC-CXR [24] dataset. Designing a box prompt for each image is labor-intensive
and unfeasible for this work, so we construct the pseudo mask based on attention maps.

Attention Aggregation. Inspired by CLIP [3], we incorporate an attention pooling mechanism in
conjunction with the non-linear projector Pv to derive a pixel-wise attention map. A dense feature
map Vi is extracted from the final convolutional layer before the pooling operation in the image
encoder Fe, with the dimension C × H × W. Here, C denotes the number of channels, while
H and W represent the height and width of the feature maps. Subsequently, we reshape Vi into
a dimension of HW × C. In this way, Vi can be interpreted as a sequence of pixel embeddings,
where each token in this sequence represents the embedding of an individual pixel. The length
of this sequence is defined by the number of channels, C. A special token, [CLS], is introduced
to aggregate all pixel embeddings through multi-head self-attention (MHSA) [25, 3]. This process
offers an attention score matrix W h
i for each pixel, with dimensions h×H×W. Here, h signifies the

4


---Page Break---
attention head number, and h ∈H, with H being the total number of attention heads. This attention
score matrix characterizes the information exchange between pixels and semantics provided by the
text [3, 18], and therefore it carries semantic information and is an ideal candidate for constructing
the pretext pseudo mask. To derive the pseudo mask, we aggregate W h
i across all attention heads to
produce ˆWi, as described by:

ˆWi =

Mask Filtering and Edge Smoothing. After obtaining the aggregated attention map ˆWi, we up-
sample it to match the original image dimensions H
′ × W
′. To remove pseudo mask regions in the
background, we construct a body mask for each CXR image using a histogram-based thresholding
approach, following common practice [26, 27]. Subsequently, all attention scores outside the body
mask are set to zero. A threshold is applied to filter out low attention scores within the body mask,
transforming ˆWi into a binary mask. The threshold is determined at the 85% percentile of attention
scores from ˆWi. The binary pseudo mask Mi is formulated as:

M j,k

j = 1, 2, 3, ..., H

(3)

To smooth the square-like boundary in the mask caused by upsampling, we apply bilateral filtering
(BF) [28] to Mi, resulting in a refined pseudo mask ˜
Mi, as shown in Fig. 2 Right. A comprehensive
ablation study discussing the threshold and smoothing operation is presented in Sec. 4.5.

3.3
Dense Visual Representation Learning through Pseudo Segmentation in VLP

While the global visual representation can be learned via VLA, dense representation often lacks
direct alignment. To tackle this limitation, we introduce an image decoder, denoted as Fd, as shown
in Fig. 2 Left. This decoder takes visual feature Vi as input and utilises the pseudo mask ˜
Mi as
the supervisory signal for the pretext task. We employ the commonly used soft Dice loss and binary
cross-entropy loss [27] to optimise this task. The training loss function for LPA is formulated as:

LPA = 1

The total loss for G2D is the sum of the VLA loss (Eq. 1) and the PA loss (Eq. 4):

(5)

It is worth noting that the pseudo mask is designed as a pixel-wise pretext supervisory signal. Al-
though there is no manual annotation involved, the pseudo mask is constructed from the visual
feature of the image encoder, which is pre-trained to align with radiology reports and thus contains
clinical knowledge such as anatomical regions mentioned by the reports. In this sense, it can be a
good surrogate target for learning pixel-wise semantic information. To demonstrate that the pseudo
mask serves as a meaningful target for dense visual pre-training, we conduct an ablation study to
use a perturbed pseudo mask with corrupt semantics for pre-training, and compare it to the proposed
pseudo mask, as detailed in Table 8 and Sec A.6.

Experiments and Analysis

In this section, we compare our approach with SOTA medical VLP techniques. The implementation
details and dataset training/test splits are reported in Sec A.3, A.4.

Pretraining Dataset and Configuration We utilise the MIMIC-CXR dataset [29, 24]. After prepro-
cessing based on established protocols [9, 5], it provides 213,384 image-text pairs for pre-training.
For the VLP part, we employ a standard ResNet-50 as the vision encoder Fe and adopt the decoder
part of a U-Net as the vision decoder Fd. We adopt ClinicalBERT [30] as the text encoder using
configurations described in [5, 21]. In line with [9, 8], G2D is pre-trained for 50 epochs across 16
A100 GPUs, each accommodating a batch size of 128. The AdamW optimizer is employed with a
learning rate set to 2 × 10−4 and a weight decay of 1 × 10−8. Additionally, a linear warm-up and a
cosine annealing scheduler are incorporated in the training process.

4.1
Downstream Task Datasets and Configurations

For downstream tasks, our focus is to evaluate the efficacy of G2D in learning granular visual fea-
tures that can be used for localisation, vision-language understanding, and visual recognition tasks.
We examine the capability and transferability of the learned cross-modal representations by using
them for five distinct medical imaging tasks, covering a spectrum of 25 different diseases.

Medical Image Segmentation. This task utilises the RSNA [31] and SIIM [32] datasets, follow-
ing preprocessing guidelines established in [9, 8]. We adopt U-Net [1] fine-tuning configurations
following [8, 9]. The pre-trained vision encoder is frozen, while only the decoder parameters are
updated during fine-tuning. Performance is assessed using the Dice score, following the evaluation
protocol in [8, 9]. It is noteworthy that the original MedKLIP [5] uses a different configuration
(updating the vision encoder) compared to other methods (freezing the vision encoder) [4, 8, 9, 6].
Therefore, in these experiments, we reference the results reported in [20], which reimplemented
MedKLIP under a setting consistent with all other methods. For a fair comparison specifically with
MedKLIP, we also reimplement G2D under MedKLIP’s original setting, as reported in the Sec A.5.

Medical Object Detection. This task is conducted using the RSNA dataset [31] for Pneumonia
Detection and the Object-CXR dataset [33] for Foreign Objects Detection, adhering to preprocessing
methods from [9]. We employ YOLOv3 [34] for detection, using the pre-trained vision encoder and
updating an additional detection head during fine-tuning. We report the mean Average Precision
(mAP) with IoU thresholds between 0.4∼0.75. The setup for this task is in accordance with in [9].

Zero-shot Medical Image Visual Grounding. In accordance with [5], this task is conducted on
the RSNA [31] and SIIM [32] datasets, using the same official data split and evaluation metrics. We
employ CXR images as input and utilise the corresponding ground truth label maps for assessing
the grounding performance, in terms of recall, IoU, and Dice score.

Zero-shot Medical Image Classification. In compliance with the guidelines set forth in [5, 21],
we conduct this task on the RSNA [31], SIIM [32], CheXpert [35], and CXR14 [36] datasets. For
the RSNA and SIIM datasets, we employ the test set splits provided by MedKLIP [5], given that
KAD [21] did not conduct experiments on these two datasets. For the CheXpert and CXR14 datasets
[35, 36], we use the official test set splits to ensure a fair comparison with KAD [21]. It is important
to note that MedKLIP [5] creates its own test split rather than using the official test split. Hence, we
do not use MedKLIP’s splits in our experiments. We report the results using the macro average of
AUC, F1, and ACC scores across all diseases.

Medical Image Fine-tuned Classification.
In alignment with [5, 21], we use the CXR14
dataset [36], comprising 112,120 frontal-view X-rays from 30,805 patients, annotated for 14 dis-
eases. We adhere to the official split for consistent evaluation, following KAD [21]. It is worth
noting that MedKLIP does not use the official data split. Hence, we refer to the results reported in
KAD [21] rather than those from the original MedKLIP [5]. To ensure a fair comparison with Med-
KLIP, we reimplemented G2D for this experiment under the MedKLIP configuration, as detailed
in Sec A.5. CXR images are resized to 256 × 256 [21]. During fine-tuning, all model parameters
are updated, including the pre-trained vision encoder and linear classifier. The AdamW optimizer is
used with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 64 for 50 epochs. Evaluation is based on
the AUC score, adhering to the protocol outlined in [8, 9, 12].

Additionally, for a fair comparison specifically with MedKLIP, we compare G2D with MedKLIP under its
original configuration in Tab 7 and Sec A.5.

Medical Image Linear Classification. In strict accordance with the configuration in [8, 4, 9], this
task is conducted on the CheXpert [35], RSNA [31], and COVIDx [37] datasets. We only update a
randomly initialized linear classification layer, while the pre-trained vision encoder remains frozen.
For fair evaluation, we employ AUC scores on CheXpert and RSNA, along with accuracy metrics on
COVIDx, as mentioned in [8, 9]. Apart from zero-shot image classification and visual grounding,
we fine-tune using 1%, 10%, 100% of the training data for all downstream tasks. Detailed settings,
including implementation and data splits, are outlined in Sec A.4.

4.2
Performance on Visual Localisation Tasks

In Tab 1, following [16, 38], we evaluate G2D alongside other SOTA approaches on two pivotal
visual localisation tasks: semantic segmentation and object detection. The aim is to assess the
efficacy of the dense visual features learned.

Initially, we transfer only the encoder weights from the pre-trained G2D for the segmentation task,
adhering to the protocols of [9, 8, 4, 6]. In this setup, our approach consistently achieves the highest
performance across all data fractions for both SIIM [32] and RSNA datasets [31]. To assess the
impact of the visual decoder pre-trained with the PS pretext task, we transfer the weights of both the
encoder and decoder from G2D for the segmentation task, resulting in striking outcomes. Remark-
ably, with just 1% of training data, G2D surpasses the performance of all peer methods, even those
trained with a full 100% of training data. This observation underlines the fact that the pixel-level
pretext task, PS, significantly improves the quality of dense visual features derived from VLP, which
provide advantages for the downstream segmentation task.

In object detection, our method consistently outperforms existing methods across all data fractions
for both RSNA and Object-CXR datasets [31, 33]. Notably, G2D achieves a 3.8% mAP on the
Object-CXR dataset with just 1% of the data for fine-tuning, a significant leap from other methods
that scarcely reach a 1% mAP.

These results highlight the efficacy of our proposed model, G2D, and the pretext task, PS, especially
in semantic segmentation tasks that rely on dense visual features. PS not only enables G2D to
learn visual representations in the encoder-decoder structure but also reduces the gap between pre-
training and downstream tasks. By enhancing the encoder’s ability to capture global and dense
features simultaneously, PS surpasses existing approaches, proving particularly advantageous for
object detection tasks that heavily rely on dense features [39].

4.3
Performance on Vision-Language Understanding

In Tab 2, we evaluate the efficacy of G2D on vision-language understanding tasks, zero-shot visual
grounding and zero-shot image classification. For the zero-shot visual grounding task, our proposed
method outperforms peer approaches. Specifically, on the SIIM dataset [32], it achieves a leading
Dice score of 5.1. This dominance persists in the RSNA dataset [31], where our method reaches a

Table 3: Evaluation of image classification fine-tuning on the CXR14 dataset is conducted, with all metrics
presented as AUC scores, where the mean metric is macro-averaged. Best performances are highlighted in
bold. Methods marked with ⋆utilize extra annotated data for pre-training. MedKLIP’s results here differ from
the original study [5] as it did not utilize the official test split, unlike KAD [21]. We use the result of MedKLIP
reported by KAD [21], which reimplemented MedKLIP on the official test set for fairness. All results in
this table are sourced from KAD [21]. To compare fairly with MedKLIP, we assess G2D against its original

Dice score of 47.7, surpassing other SOTA approaches. When examining zero-shot image classifi-
cation, our method again shows its superiority across the AUC, F1, and ACC metrics on both the
RSNA [31] and SIIM datasets [32]. Such consistent and superior outcomes underscore the adapt-
ability and effectiveness of G2D in handling vision-language understanding tasks, indicating that
integrating PS into G2D can enhance not only uni-modal but also cross-modal tasks.

Performance on Visual Recognition Tasks

In our final assessment focused on visual recognition, Tab 3 demonstrates our method’s consistent
supremacy on the CXR14 dataset [36] for fine-tuned disease classification across 1%, 10%, and
100% training data. Similarly, Tab 4 underscores that G2D achieves the highest performance on the
CheXpert, RSNA, and COVIDx datasets [35, 31, 37] for linear evaluation across all training data
ratio. Notably, G2D consistently outperforms even those methods like MedKLIP and KAD [41] that
leverage additional disease-level annotations during pre-training stage. This demonstrates G2D’s
representative visual features, suggesting that enhancing dense representation learning via PS can
also improve results in tasks primarily anchored on global representation.

Ablation Studies

Pseudo Segmentation vs. Reconstruction. In Tab 5a, we evaluate the impact of the proposed PS
pretext task in comparison to pixel reconstruction and models without a decoder-level constraint.
The model pre-trained with PS outperforms the other two approaches across all three downstream
tasks, particularly in semantic segmentation. While the model pre-trained with a pixel reconstruction
constraint exhibit improved performance compared to unconstrained variants, such models still un-
derperform the model with the PS constraint. These results underscore the effectiveness of decoder-
level pretext tasks and suggest that an emphasis on high-level semantics, derived from PS, is more
beneficial than focusing on the low-level semantics from pixel reconstruction. The PS potentially
reduces the disparity between features learned through VLP and those required by downstream se-
mantic segmentation tasks. It also enables the model to acquire more representative features that are
beneficial for various tasks.
Threshold of Pseudo Mask Construction. As shown in Tab 5b, performance varies with different
thresholds, with the 85% percentile threshold proving most effective across all three downstream
tasks. Despite employing the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for pseudo mask creation, as sug-
gested by [42], its performance is still surpassed by the 85% percentile approach. This indicates that
the original attention map might contain noise, and a higher threshold is beneficial for generating
more effective pseudo masks.
Furthermore, Tab 5d highlights the importance of aggregating multi-head attention maps for mask
construction. Given the absence of explicit semantic supervision in the PS pretext task, not aggre-
gating these maps leads to the creation of multiple pseudo masks. This excess of masks introduce
ambiguous training objectives for VLP.
Impact of Mask Refinement. Refinement of the pseudo masks affects the model’s efficacy, as
shown in Tab 5f. Performance tends to decrease when either the body mask is omitted or edge
smoothing is not applied. However, integrating both these strategies, as we implement in G2D,
yields optimal results. This underscores the vital role of pseudo mask refinement in enhancing
model performance.
Ablation on Hyperparameters. We further ablate the number of attention heads and projector di-
mensionality. Performance improves with more attention heads, peaking at 3 before slightly declin-

ing at 4 (Tab 5e). Optimal segmentation and classification results are achieved with 128-dimensional
projectors. While 256 dimensions provide slight benefits for object detection, they reduce perfor-
mance in other tasks (Tab 5c). Projectors of 512 dimensions do not yield further gains. Thus, we
select 3 attention heads and 128-dimensional projectors for an optimal balance of complexity and
effectiveness.

Conclusion

In this study, we introduce G2D, a novel medical VLP framework for learning global and dense-level
representations. Our proposed pixel-level pretext task, pseudo segmentation, leverages a refined at-
tention map to predict a pseudo mask, capturing dense visual features during VLP without requiring
additional trainable parameters for its construction. Our model pretrained with this pretext task
achieves superior performance across five diverse medical imaging tasks and outperforms methods
pretrained with annotated data [5, 21], especially in semantic segmentation. Specifically, on the
SIIM [32] dataset, G2D, when fine-tuned with only 1% of the training data, outperforms other med-
ical VLP approaches that utilize the full 100% training set. We anticipate that G2D will inspire
further exploration of novel and clinically-guided pretext tasks for medical VLP.

A.1
Limitations and Future Work

Our work primarily concentrates on learning dense visual representations from pseudo masks, which
are generated from attention masks under language supervision. Due to the weak supervision signal,
the pseudo masks may not effectively associate each pixel with the corresponding text tokens, poten-
tially capping the performance of our method. Currently, our approach involves learning both global
and pixel-level representations through VLP. In future studies, we aim to delve into regional vi-
sual representations during VLP to establish more precise correlations between specific chest X-ray
(CXR) regions and phrases in radiology reports.

A.2
Broader Impacts

Our G2D model offers an effective approach for the automatic diagnosis of chest X-ray abnormali-
ties using a small amount of annotated data. This can help decrease the burden on radiologists and
enhance healthcare in underprivileged regions. However, medical data, such as chest X-rays and
radiology reports, might include sensitive or potentially harmful information. We strongly advise a
thorough examination of the data prior to using our model in real-world applications.

A.3
Pre-training Implementation Details

Figure 3: An exemplar pair of X-ray image and associated clinical report from the MIMIC-CXR
dataset [24].

The chest X-ray (CXR) images from the MIMIC-CXR dataset [29] are resized to dimensions of
256 × 256 and subsequently center-cropped to 224 × 224, adhering to the procedure described
in [4, 8, 9], with an example shown in Fig 3. The intensity of each image is normalized to a range
of [0, 1]. During the pre-training stage, we employ data augmentation techniques including random
grayscale, random perspective, and auto contrast adjustments, using the PyTorch vision library1.

A.4
Downstream Task Implementation Details

The data split information into train/valid/test sets are described in Tab. 6. For all downstream tasks,
except from zero-shot image classification and visual grounding, we train with 1%, 10%, 100% of
the training set. The downstream tasks are deployed on a 40G A100 GPU.

A.4.1
Visual Localization

Medical Image Segmentation.
For the segmentation tasks on the RSNA [31] and SIIM [32]
datasets, we initially employ the vision encoder from the pre-trained model. Additionally, we trans-
fer both the vision encoder and decoder from the pre-trained model, and proceed to train the segmen-
tation network. We implement early stopping during the training process, limiting it to 50 epochs.
A learning rate of 2e-4 and a weight decay of 0.05 are adopted. AdamW is utilized as the optimizer,
with β1 and β2 values set at 0.9 and 0.999, respectively. For the SIIM [32] dataset, the default batch
size is set at 8, while for the RSNA [31] dataset, it is set at 16. All configurations strictly adhere to
the protocol provided in [9].

Medical Image Object Detection. The pneumonia detection task on RSNA [31] and foreign ob-
jects detection task on Object-CXR [33] datasets are executed on a single A100 GPU. For both
datasets, early stopping is implemented during the training process, limited to 50 epochs. AdamW
is employed as the optimizer across both datasets. For the RSNA [31] dataset, a batch size of 8 is
set for 1% data fine-tuning with a learning rate of 2e-4, a weight decay of 1e-6, and β1, β2 values
of 0.9 and 0.999, respectively. For 10% and 100% data fine-tuning, the batch size is adjusted to 16,
with a learning rate of 5e-4, a weight decay of 1e-6, and the same β1, β2 values. Similarly, for the
Object-CXR [33] dataset, a batch size of 8 is set for 1% data fine-tuning, with the identical learning
rate, weight decay, and β values as the RSNA dataset. For 10% and 100% data fine-tuning, the batch
size is adjusted to 16, again with a learning rate of 5e-4, a weight decay of 1e-6, and β1, β2 values
of 0.9 and 0.999. The IOU and NMS thresholds are set at [0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75]
and 0.5, respectively. All configurations are in strict compliance with the protocol delineated in [9].

A.4.2
Vision-Language Understanding

Zero-shot Image Classification. The original CXR image goes through a two-step preprocessing
routine. Initially, it is resized to the dimension of 256 × 256, and then center cropped to 224 × 224.
Following the methodologies outlined in [8, 9], all pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].
The resulting resized image is then fed through a visual encoder, followed by a visual projector to
generate the image embedding ˆvi. Simultaneously, the prompts are fed into a text encoder to obtain
text embeddingsˆli. The classification evaluation hinges on measuring the cosine similarity between
the image and text embeddings for each prompt associated with a specific class. The classification
outcome is determined by comparing the cosine similarities. Specifically, if the cosine similarity
between the image embedding and the positive prompt (e.g., disease) surpasses that between the
image embedding and the corresponding negative prompt (e.g., No disease), the outcome is deemed
positive. Conversely, if the reverse holds true, the outcome is negative. The prompt is designed
following [7].

Zero-shot Visual Grounding. To execute this task, we adhere to the BioViL pipeline as described
in [40]. The visual grounding task can be regarded as a pixel-level classification task, driven by the

14


---Page Break---
text prompt and the dense visual embedding. The image is fed into the visual encoder to acquire the
dense feature map Vi from the final convolutional layer of the image encoder, yielding a shape of
C × H × W. At the same time, the prompt is processed through the text encoder and projected into
the cross-modal space, resulting inˆli. The cosine similarity betweenˆli and all elements of Vi at the
channel level generates a similarity map. This map is then resized to match the original image size
and utilized as the segmentation results to evaluate the zero-shot grounding performance.

A.4.3
Visual Recognition

We conduct evaluations on the CheXpert [35], RSNA [31], COVIDx [37], and CXR14 datasets [36].
In alignment with previous studies [8, 4, 9, 5, 21], linear classification is implemented on CheX-
pert [35], RSNA [31], and COVIDx [37]. Here, we update a randomly initialized linear layer while
keeping the visual encoder frozen. We adhere to the official test set partition from [5, 21, 36] for a
fair comparison. During our linear classification task, training is performed over 50 epochs with a
learning rate of 5e-4, a batch size of 8, employing the AdamW optimizer with parameters: β1 = 0.9
and β2 = 0.999. For the CXR14 dataset [36], we follow the experimental setup from [21], employ-
ing fine-tuned classification while updating all parameters from the visual encoder and linear layer.
Images are resized to 256 × 256 and data augmentation is carried out as recommended in [21]. The
AdamW optimizer is utilized with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a batch size of 64 for 50 epochs.
The linear classification tasks are executed on a single A100 GPU with 40GB memory, using the
vision encoder from our pre-trained model as the visual backbone. Fine-tuning is carried out on the
randomly initialized linear layer for 50 epochs with early stopping, maintaining a learning rate of
5e-4 and a default batch size of 8. We set AdamW as our optimizer, with β1 of 0.9, β2 of 0.999, and
a weight decay rate of 1e-6.

To strictly compare our work with MedKLIP [5], we reimplement G2D for fine-tuning on CXR14
classification, as well as SIIM and RSNA segmentation tasks, adhering strictly to the MedKLIP
configuration. This approach is necessary because the settings of MedKLIP differ significantly from
the other methods that we compare to, such as [4, 8, 9, 6, 21]. Specifically, MedKLIP updates
both the encoder and decoder during segmentation tasks, whereas the other methods only update the
decoder and keep the encoder frozen. Moreover, MedKLIP employs its own customized data split
for CXR14 classification, contrasting with KAD [21], which uses the official CXR14 dataset split.

Given these differences, comparing other methods directly under the MedKLIP setting could be seen
as unfair. Therefore, we conducted a separate comparison between G2D and MedKLIP using the
MedKLIP setting. The results, presented in Tab 7, demonstrate that G2D outperforms MedKLIP
across all tasks and data ratios, even within the MedKLIP setting.

A.6
Verifying Pseudo Segmentation with Semantic Meaning

To investigate whether the improvements in G2D come from learning dense visual features through
pseudo segmentation (PS) or from treating PS as a regularization term during pre-training, we per-
turbed the semantic integrity of pseudo masks by randomly shuffling them on a sample-wise basis
(i.e., making images and pseudo masks unpaired). This operation detaches pseudo masks’ semantic
connection to the original images, ensuring that the PS task does not learn correct semantic informa-
tion, but still provide regularisation to the segmentation as the pseudo mask is relatively smooth. The
results are presented in Table 8. G2D with uncorrupted pseudo masks in PS (ours) significantly out-
performs the results from the shuffled alternative (unpaired images and pseudo masks), not only in

that the proposed G2D indeed learns transferable visual features thanks to the semantic information
provided by the pseudo masks, rather than merely treating PS as a regularization mechanism.

Pseudo Mask Visualization

pseudo mask for the pseudo segmentation task. Red and blue arrows point to areas related to specific
text descriptions. Right: Corresponding radiology report. Red and blue text emphasize regions
represented in the pseudo mask.

We visualize the aggregated attention map, pseudo mask, and paired medical reports in Fig 4. In-
triguingly, without human annotations, both the attention map and pseudo mask successfully capture
image regions corresponding to various report words. The pseudo masks manage to capture impor-
tant parts of the image regions related to the highlighted words in the clinical reports, as indicated
by the red and blue arrows in Fig 4. This suggests that the supervision signal for the PS pretext task
is enriched by the clinical knowledge and high-level semantics, which explain why the PS pretext
task may be better than the pixel reconstruction pretext task.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims presented in the abstract and introduction accurately repre-
sent the contributions and scope of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these
goals are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Refer to Section A.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means
that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The au-
thors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what
the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the ap-
proach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to ad-
dress problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: This work mainly includes empirical contributions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo-
rems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a
short proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple-
mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu-
sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed experimental configurations in Sections 4.1, A.3, and
A.4. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps
taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture
fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation,
it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with
the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data
is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via
detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in
the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means
that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all sub-
missions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear
how to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to re-
produce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to
construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case au-
thors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our experiments are all conducted on publicly accessible datasets, and all
experiment details are illustrated in Sections 4.1, A.3, and A.4. For experiment implemen-
tation, we follow the official code of exisiting works, all code can be found in their official
GitHub repository.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All experiment details are illustrated in Sections 4.1, A.3, and A.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of
detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropri-
ate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the error bars for all ablation studies.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer-
ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of
Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Refer to the first part of Sections 4.1, A.3, and A.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments
that didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: This work is conducted in accordance with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the Section A.2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

20


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact spe-
cific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitiga-
tion strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work does not focus on content generation and uses clinically verified
datasets for all experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by re-
quiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or
implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the li-
cense of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no new assets released in this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can
either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the pa-
per include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable,
as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work has no human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should
be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, cura-
tion, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the
data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work has no human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equiva-
lent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval,
you should clearly state this in the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity
(if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
