Abstract

Serialization-based methods, which serialize the 3D voxels and group them into
multiple sequences before inputting to Transformers, have demonstrated their
effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, serializing 3D voxels into 1D
sequences will inevitably sacrifice the voxel spatial proximity. Such an issue
is hard to be addressed by enlarging the group size with existing serialization-
based methods due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers with feature sizes.
Inspired by the recent advances of state space models (SSMs), we present a Voxel
SSM, termed as Voxel Mamba, which employs a group-free strategy to serialize
the whole space of voxels into a single sequence. The linear complexity of SSMs
encourages our group-free design, alleviating the loss of spatial proximity of
voxels. To further enhance the spatial proximity, we propose a Dual-scale SSM
Block to establish a hierarchical structure, enabling a larger receptive field in the 1D
serialization curve, as well as more complete local regions in 3D space. Moreover,
we implicitly apply window partition under the group-free framework by positional
encoding, which further enhances spatial proximity by encoding voxel positional
information. Our experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset
show that Voxel Mamba not only achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art
methods, but also demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency.

Introduction

LiDAR-based 3D object detection from point clouds plays an important role in applications of
autonomous driving [19, 4], virtual reality [47], and robots [45]. The sparsely, unevenly and irregularly
distributed point cloud data make the efficient and effective 3D object detection a very challenging
task. To address these long-standing challenges, researchers have recently proposed several strategies
to improve the model architecture. One strategy is to switch from PointNet-based models [49, 79, 56]
to sparse convolutional neural network (SpCNN)-based models [70, 54, 10, 14, 55, 27] in order for
more effective feature extraction. However, the sparse convolution is unfriendly for deployment and
optimization, requiring tremendous engineering efforts. Therefore, another strategy is to switch from
SpCNN to serialization-based Transformers to address this issue [13, 65, 38, 69, 42]. These methods
usually group non-empty 3D voxels into multiple short sequences by serialization techniques such as

window partition [65, 13, 38], Z-shape sorting [66], and Hilbert sorting [69], as shown in Figs. 1 (a)
and (b), where a sequence is a group of voxels to be processed by Transformer layers.

However, the serialization of voxels will inevitably sacrifice their spatial proximity. Some neighboring
voxels can be far apart from each other after serialization, as illustrated by the two red points
in Fig. 1 (b). Such a loss of proximity is difficult to be addressed in the existing serialization
methods [69, 66, 38, 65, 13] because the group size is limited by the quadratic complexity of
Transformers. This issue becomes even worse when neighboring voxels are grouped into different
groups. Inspired by the recent success of State Space Models (SSMs) [21, 20, 59, 18, 82, 36] in
language and vision, in this work we propose a simple yet effective group-free design to address
the loss of proximity. Specifically, we introduce a Voxel SSM, termed as Voxel Mamba, for 3D
object detection from point cloud. The linear computational complexity of SSMs makes it feasible to
treat all voxels as a single group and sort them into a single sequence. This results in a group-free
modeling of voxels, which is more efficient and deployment-friendly than previous methods since no
padding tokens are needed. Nonetheless, even we can sort all voxels into a group-free sequence, it
cannot be ensured that all of them are within an effective receptive field.

To enhance the spatial proximity of Voxel Mamba, we further propose two modules with it. The first is
the Dual-scale SSM Block (DSB) by introducing the downsampling operations in SSMs. In specific,
the forward SSM branches process the high-resolution voxel features, while the backward branches
extract features from the low-resolution representation. In this way, we integrate the hierarchical
design with the bidirectional design in a more economical way. More importantly, the hierarchy
brings a larger effective receptive field for the serialized sequence so that the spatial proximity
in local 3D regions can be enhanced. The second module we introduced is the Implicit Window
Partition (IWP). The window partition is a widely used strategy in previous methods [13, 65] to
enhance the proximity of voxels inside a window. However, it impedes the proximity of voxels across
windows and contradicts with our group-free principle. We therefore propose an implicit window
partition scheme to embrace its strengths while discarding its weaknesses. In specific, we encode the
voxel positions inside and across windows into embeddings for feature learning without explicitly
conducting spatial window partition. In this way, better voxel proximity can be achieved under our
group-free design with minimal computational cost.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose Voxel Mamba, a group-free backbone for voxel-based 3D detection. Voxel
Mamba abandons the grouping operation and serializes voxels into one single sequence,
enabling better efficiency.

• To mitigate the loss of spatial proximity due to serialization, we propose the Dual-scale SSM
Block (DSB) and the Implicit Window Partition (IWP) to enhance the spatial proximity
preservation of Voxel Mamba.

• Our method achieves superior performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the
large-scale Waymo Open dataset [60] and nuScenes [2] datasets.

3D Object Detection from Point Clouds. There are two major point cloud representations for
3D object detection, i.e., point-based and voxel-based ones. As in PointNet [50, 51], point-based
methods [49, 48, 56, 52, 37] directly extract geometric features from small regions of raw points.
However, those methods suffer from low inference efficiency and limited context features. Voxel-
based methods [54, 76, 70, 27, 79, 15–17] convert raw points into regular grids through voxelization
and then process them with sparse convolution [70] or Transformers [13, 25, 65]. Voxel-based
methods are currently the main stream for 3D object detection. In terms of model architecture,
voxel-based methods can be categorized into two groups, i.e., SpCNN-based [70, 79, 54, 55, 8, 10]
and Transformers-based [65, 13, 25, 42, 38, 26] ones. Limited by the high computation complexity,
SpCNN-based methods can only use small convolution kernels with restricted receptive fields, and
Transformer based methods can only employ a small number of voxels in each group. In contrast,
our proposed Voxel Mamba can capture long-range dependencies within the entire sequence while
achieving faster inference speed than existing state-of-the-art methods.

State Space Models. Inspired by the continuous state space models (SSMs) in control systems,
researchers [18, 21, 59, 20] have introduced the SSMs into deep neural networks as a novel alternative
to CNNs and Transformers. LSSLs [22] adopts a simple sequence-to-sequence transformation,
demonstrating the potential of SSMs. S4 [21] introduces a new parameterization method to SSMs
to reduce the computation and memory cost. S5 [59] employs MIMO SSMs and perform efficient
parallel scans based on S4. More recently, Mamba [20] introduces input-dependent SSMs and
builds a generic backbone, which is fairly competitive with the well-tuned Transformers. Vision
Mamba [82] employs bidirectional SSMs and position embedding to learn global visual context for
vision tasks. Vmamba [36] employs a 2D-selective-scan to bridge the gap between 1D scanning
and 2D plain traversing. PointMamba [34] is a pioneering work to leverage SSM for point cloud
analysis, achieving impressive performance in point cloud object understanding. Subsequently, many
SSM-based methods [24, 35, 78, 77, 68] are introduced for point cloud processing. In this paper, we
investigate the utilization of SSMs to establish a straightforward yet robust baseline for LiDAR-based
3D object detection in driving scenes.

Space-filling Curve. The space-filling curve [43] is a series of fractal curves that can go through
each point in a multi-dimensional space without repetition. The classical space-filling curve includes
Hilbert curve [29], Z-order curve [46], and sweep curve, etc. Those methods can perform dimension
reduction while maintaining spatial topology and locality. Many researchers [5, 69, 66, 38, 65, 3, 40]
have introduced space-filling curves for point cloud processing. HilbertNet [5] uses the Hilbert curve
to collapse 3D structures into 2D space to reduce computation and GPU occupation. PointGPT [3]
utilizes the Morton-order curve [44] to introduce sequential properties. OctFormer [66] preserves
Z-order during octreelization and adopts octree-attention for efficient context learning. PTV3 [69]
streamlines the complex interaction with the space-filling curve serialization. For 3D object detection,
some methods [65, 38] employ window sweep curves to group voxel features for parallel computation.
We employ the Hilbert curve due to its advantageous characteristic of locality preservation.

Point Cloud Grouping. LiDAR point clouds are sparsely and non-uniformly distributed with varying
densities. Therefore, existing methods group points or voxels to facilitate parallel computation and
reduce complexity. In point cloud analysis, some works [51, 67] use the K nearest neighbor (KNN)
method to create groups of query points. However, the heavy computation burden makes KNN hard
to scale for outdoor scenes. For 3D object detection, VoTr [42] uses a GPU-based hash table to search
neighborhoods and generate fixed-length voxel groups. Window-based Voxel Transformers [13, 61,
65, 38] group voxels by employing a window-based sorting strategy, such as the rotating partition.
To reduce the reliance on relative position in grouping operations, some recent works [66, 69, 40]
have been proposed to group voxels based on space-filling curves. However, grouping is merely
a compromise for computational complexity, which restricts the flow of information and effective
receptive field. To tackle this problem, we model the entire voxels into one single sequence and allow
each voxel be aware of global context information.

3.1
Preliminaries

The state space sequence (SSM) model is a continuous-time latent state model, which maps a 1D
input signal x(t) ∈RL to an output signal y(t) ∈RL through hidden state h(t) ∈RN. The system
can be represented as the following linear ordinary differential equation:
h′(t) = Ah(t) + Bx(t),
y(t) = Ch(t) + Dx(t),
(1)

where A ∈RN×N, B ∈RN×1 and C ∈R1×N are learnable parameters, and D ∈R1 denotes a
residual connection.

To apply SSM to a discrete sequence, we can discrete the continuous-time SSM with a timescale
parameter ∆[21, 20, 36]. The zero-order hold (ZOH) transformation can be used to discrete the con-
tinuous parameters A, B as A = exp(∆A), B = (∆A)−1(exp(∆A) −I) · ∆A. The discretized
version of Eq.(1) can be written in the following recurrent form:
(
hk = Ahk−1 + Bxk,

yk = Chk + Dxk.
(2)

Finally, the convolutional mode can be used for efficient parallel training:
(

K = (CB, CAAB, ..., CA
LB),

y = x ∗K,
(3)

where L is the length of the input sequence and K ∈RL is the structured convolution kernel.

SSM combines the advantages of convolution and self-attention with near-linear computation and
dynamic weights. It demonstrates stronger ability than Transformers in modeling long-range de-
pendencies [21, 20], which inspires us to develop a group-free framework for point cloud based 3D
object detection.

3.2
Overall Architecture

An overview of our proposed Voxel Mamba is shown in Figure 2. As in previous works [65, 74, 31],
Voxel Mamba transforms point clouds into sparse voxels by a voxel feature encoding strategy. Unlike
prior Transformer-based methods that perform extensive window partitioning and voxel grouping, in
Voxel Mamba we serialize the voxel of the entire scene into a single sequence by using the Hilbert
Input Layer (Sec. 3.3). Then, a Dual-scale SSM Block (Sec. 3.4) working on the voxel sequence
is proposed, which allows voxels to be processed with a global context. To enlarge the effective
receptive fields, DSB adopts a finer-grained perception of the voxel sequence in the forward path, and
down-samples the voxels sequence in the backward path. The backward path extracts features from
the low-resolution BEV representation, with an increased downsampling factor in deeper blocks. To
enhance the spatial proximity in sequences, Voxel Mamba adopts Implicit Window Partition (Sec. 3.5)
to preserve 3D positional information in the extracted voxel features, and projects them to a BEV
feature map. Our proposed architecture is flexible and can be applied to most existing 3D object
detection frameworks.

3.3
Hilbert Input Layer

The space-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert [29] and Z-order [46]), known for preserving spatial locality, is
widely used for dimensionality reduction. Space-filling curves, such as the Hilbert shown in Fig. 2,
can traverse all elements in a space without repetition and preserve spatial topology. To improve the
voxel proximity in serialization, we propose the Hilbert Input Layer to reorder the voxel sequence.

Denote the coordinates of voxel features as C = {(x, y, z) ∈R3|0 ≤x, y, z ≤n}. We map a voxel
onto its traversal position h within the Hilbert curve. Specifically, we transform (x, y, z) into its
binary format with log2n bits. For example, x is converted to (xmxm−1...x0), where m = ⌊log2n⌋.
Then, following [58], we iterate from xm, ym, zm to x1, y1, z1 bits and perform exchanges and
inversions to adjust the order of bits. An exchange is conducted when the current bit is 0; otherwise,
an invert is conducted. We concatenate all bits as (xmymzmxm−1ym−1zm−1 . . . x0y0z0) and apply
a global 3m-fold Gray decoding [58] on it to obtain the traversal position h. Subsequently, all voxels
are sorted into a single sequence based on their traversal position h.

In our implementation, we record the traversal position h corresponding to the coordinates of all
potential voxels. The voxels are serialized by querying and sorting their traversal positions. We
employ a distinct traversal order for each BEV resolution in Dual-scale SSM blocks. Notably, the
serialization process only takes approximately 0.7ms for a sequence of length 106.

3.4
Dual-scale SSM Block

Though space-filling curves can preserve the 3D structure to a certain degree, proximity loss is
inevitable due to the dimension collapse from 3D to 1D. As a result, a local snippet of the curve can
only cover a partial region in 3D space. As discussed in Sec. 1, placing all voxels in a single group
cannot ensure that the effective receptive field (ERF) [41, 12] could cover all voxels. Therefore, in
this subsection we introduce the Dual-scale SSM block (DSB) to build a hierarchy of state space
structures and consequently improve the ERF of the model.

As shown in Fig. 2, the DSB block is designed with a residual connection [28], a forward SSM branch
and a backward SSM branch. It operates on two serialized voxel sequences generated by the Hilbert
Input Layer, enabling a seamless flow of information throughout the voxel sequence. The forward
branch processes the original voxel sequence, maintaining high-resolution details. The backward
branch, however, operates on a down-sampled voxel sequence derived from a low-resolution BEV
representation. This dual-scale path allows DSB to incorporate larger-scale voxel features, enhancing
the model’s ability to model long dependencies among voxels. Specifically, given a voxel sequence
F and its corresponding coordinates C, DSB is computed as:
Ff = LN(FSSM(HIL(F + IWE(C)))),

Fb = Up(LN(BSSM(HIL(Down(F) + IWE(C
′))))),
eF = Ff + Fb + F,

(4)

where HIL(·) represents the Hilbert Input Layer, FSSM(·) and BSSM(·) denote the forward and
backward SSM, LN(·) stands for Layer Normalization, and C
′ is the coordinates of downsampled

---Page Break---
sparse voxels. Besides, Down(·) and Up(·) refer to the downsampling and upsampling operations,
respectively, and IWE(·) means Implicit Window Embedding. Overall, DSB integrates the widely
adopted bidirectional design [82, 36] with the hierarchical design, building sufficient receptive field
to mitigate the loss of proximity without introducing additional parameters.

3.5
Implicit Window Partition

The window partition strategy is widely used in previous 3D detectors [13, 65] to enhance the voxel
proximity. In these methods, the whole field is partitioned into multiple local windows and the voxels
within a window form a group. Therefore, the voxels inside a window will have sufficient proximity;
however, the voxels in different windows will have minimal proximity. In this section, we aim to
introduce the advantages of window partition into our framework while avoiding its weaknesses.

To fulfill our goal, we propose an Implicit Window Partition (IWP) strategy. Unlike previous methods,
we do not explicitly partition voxels into windows and apply Transformer or SSM within each
window. In contrast, we calculate the voxel coordinates inside and across windows, and then encode
coordinates to embeddings, termed as Implicit Window Embedding (IWE), which is formulated as:

IWE = MLP(concat(z, ⌊xi

w ⌋, ⌊yi

h ⌋, xi mod w, yi mod h)), i = 0, 1
(5)

where ⌊·⌋is the floor function, w, h define the window shape, and z, xi, yi are the coordinates of
tokens. (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) represent the coordinates before and after an implicit window shift.
The IWE is shared across all layers with the same stride. Thus, its computation cost only comes
from shallow MLPs. With IWE, voxels in the serialized 1D curve are aware of their positions and
consequently their proximity in 3D space.

3.6
The Voxel Mamba Backbone

With the proposed Hilbert Input Layer, DSB and IWP strategies, we build Voxel Mamba, a group-free
sparse voxel backbone. The architecture of Voxel Mamba is illustrated in Figure 2. It comprises N
DSB blocks, which are organized into different stages based on their downsampling rates. SpConv [9]
is employed to progressively decrease the feature map resolution along the Z-axis in each stage.
Before sparse tokens are fed into the BEV backbone, we scatter them into dense BEV features. On
the Waymo dataset, we adopt the BEV backbone from Centerpoint-Pillar [74], and employ the same
setting as DSVT [65] for the detection head and loss function. On the nuScenes dataset, we only
replace the 3D backbone of DSVT [65] with our Voxel Mamba backbone.

Experiments

4.1
Datasets and Evaluation Metrics

Waymo Open Dataset contains 230k annotated samples, partitioned into 160k for training, 40k for
validation and 30k for testing. Each frame covers a large perception range (150m × 150m). The
mean average precision (mAP) and its weighted variant by heading accuracy (mAPH) are used as
evaluation metrics. They are further categorized into Level 1 for objects detected by over five points,
and Level 2 for those detected with at least one point.

nuScenes consists of 40k labeled samples, with 28k for training, 6k for validation and 6k for testing.
For 3D object detection, nuScenes employs the mean average precision (mAP) and the nuScenes
detection score (NDS) to measure model performance.

4.2
Implementation Details

Our method is implemented based on the open-source framework OpenPCDet [63]. The voxel
sizes are defined as (0.32m, 0.32m, 0.1875m) for Waymo and (0.3m, 0.3m, 0.2m) for nuScenes.
We stack six DSB blocks, divided into three stages, for the Voxel Mamba backbone network. The
downsampling rates for DSBs’ backward branches in each stage are {1, 2, 4}. Specifically, we employ
SpConv [9] and its counterpart SpInverseConv as downsampling and upsampling operators in the
DSB backward branch. On the Waymo dataset, we follow the training schemes in [65, 74] to optimize

the model using Adam optimizer with weight decay 0.05, one-cycle learning rate policy, max learning
rate 0.0025, and batch size 24 for 24 epochs. On the nuScenes dataset, we follow the training scheme
adopted in DSVT [65]. We train Voxel Mamba with a weight decay of 0.05, one-cycle learning rate
policy, max learning rate of 0.004, and batch size of 32 for 20 epochs. The voxel features on both
datasets consist of 128 channels. All the models are trained on 8 RTX A6000 GPUs. Other settings
in the training and inference of Voxel Mamba follow DSVT [65].

Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods

Waymo. We first compare Voxel Mamba with state-of-the-art methods on the Waymo Open dataset.
Table 1 shows the results on the validation set. Our proposed Voxel Mamba achieves 79.6/73.4
on L1/L2 mAPH, which are +1.4 and +1.5 better than DSVT-Voxel. Since our framework differs
from DSVT only on the 3D backbone, it can be concluded that Voxel Mamba has superior ability in
capturing voxel features. In comparison with window-based (e.g., DSVT) or curve-based (e.g., PTv3)
grouping methods, our group-free method Voxel Mamba consistently delivers better results. Table 2
shows the results on the test split. Voxel Mamba reaches 79.6/74.3 in terms of L1/L2 mAPH, which
is even better than the 3-frame setting of PillarNeXt and SST.

nuScenes. We then compare Voxel Mamba with previous state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes.
Table 3 shows the results on the validation set. Voxel Mamba achieves impressive results with 71.9

NDS and 67.5 mAP, which is +0.5 and +0.8 higher than the previous best method. Compared with
DSVT, Voxel Mamba achieves +1.1 higher performance on mAP. The results on the test split are
shown in Table 4. Our method also exhibits the best mAP and NDS.

Inference Efficiency. We compare Voxel Mamba with other state-of-the-art methods in inference
speed and performance accuracy in Fig. 3. Notably, Voxel Mamba outperforms DSVT [65] and
PV-RCNN++ [54] by at least +1.5 in detection accuracy, while achieving faster speed. Some methods,
such as CenterPoint [74] and PointPillar [31], are faster than Voxel Mamba; however, their accuracy
is substantially lower.

We further compare Voxel Mamba with previous well-designed architectures (SpCNN, Transformers,
and 2D CNN) in GPU memory in Table 5. Compared with CenterPoint-Pillar, Voxel Mamba requires
only an additional 0.5 GB GPU memory but achieves +9.0 higher accuracy in L2 mAPH. While
Transformer-based methods like SST [13] and DSVT [65] use group partitioning, they still consume
more memory than our group-free Voxel Mamba. All the experiments are evaluated on an NVIDIA
A100 GPU with the same environment.

Ablation Studies

To better investigate the effectiveness of Voxel Mamba, we conduct a set of ablation studies by using
the nuScenes validation set. We follow OpenPCDet [63] to train all models for 20 epochs.

Effectiveness of Space-filling Curves. There are some potential alternatives to Hilbert curve for
preserving locality. Here, we compare Hilbert curve with some commonly used space-filling curves
(Z-order [66] and window partition [13]) in 3D detection. As shown in Table 6(a), without using
space-filling curves (i.e., the row of ‘Random Curve’), there will be a notable decline in performance,
which indicates that spatial proximity is crucial in the group-free setting. By using the Z-order curve

and window partition to introduce spatial proximity, the mAP and NDS are much improved. The
serialization based on the Hilbert curve can further enhance the model performance.

Effectiveness of Each Component. To more clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the different
components in Voxel Mamba, we conduct experiments by adding each of them to a baseline, which is
set to Centerpoint-Pillar [74]. As shown in Table 6(b), bidirectional SSMs with a Hilbert-based group-
free sequence can significantly improve the accuracy over the baseline, which validates the feasibility
of our group-free strategy. Besides, converting pillar to voxel can enhance much the detector’s
performance without group size constraints. Voxel Mamba with DSB obtain better performance
than the plain bidirectional SSMs. This is because DSB can build larger ERFs and mitigate the loss
of proximity. Furthermore, IWE further boosts Voxel Mamba’s performance for its capability in
capturing 3D position information and increasing voxel proximity.

Downsampling Rates of DSB. We evaluate the impact of different downsampling rates in DSB by
adjusting the stride {d1, d2, d3} in the backward SSM branch at each stage. di = 1 means the original
resolution is used. The results are shown in Table 6(c). We see that transitioning from {1,1,1} to
{1,2,2} and to {1,2,4} enhances performance due to an enlarged effective receptive field and improved
proximity by using larger downsampling rates at late stages. However, DSBs with {2,2,2} or {4,4,4}
compromise performance compared to {1,1,1}, indicating that using larger downsampling rates at
early stages will lose some fine details. Thus, we set the stride as {1,2,4} to strike a balance between
effective receptive fields and detail preservation.

Mamba (middle) and DSVT (right).

Effectiveness of IWE. Table 6(d) validates the capability of IWE to enhance spatial proximity. We
compare IWE with some commonly used positional embedding methods [13, 65] in 3D detection.
Absolute position denotes the direct encoding of voxel coordinates using an MLP. The results
demonstrate that IWE can significantly improve the detection performance by offering features with
rich 3D positional and proximate information.

4.5
Effective Receptive Field of Voxel Mamba

Fig. 4 illustrates the Effective Receptive Fields [41, 12] (ERFs) of window partition-based method
DSVT [65], group-based bidirectional Mamba and our proposed group-free method Voxel Mamba.
For clear visualization, all models take pillars as inputs. The group partition in the group-based
bidirectional Mamba is configured identically to DSVT. Then, we randomly select voxels of interest
from the ground truth bounding box and calculate the ERF at each non-empty voxel position.
Subsequently, we merge the ERFs into a single image by taking the maximum value at each voxel
location. A wider activation area indicates a larger ERF. From Fig. 4, we see that Voxel Mamba
exhibits a notably larger ERF than DSVT and group-based bidirectional Mamba, which can be
attributed to the benefits of group-free operation. The larger ERF can cover a more complete local
region and enhance the spatial proximity in 1D sequences.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed Voxel Mamba, a group-free SSM-based 3D backbone for point cloud based
3D detection. We first analyzed the proximity loss of group partition in current serialization-based 3D
detection methods. By taking the advantage of linear complexity of SSMs, we proposed a group-free
strategy to alleviate the loss of spatial proximity in 3D to 1D serialization. We further proposed
the DSB block and IWP strategy to build larger effective receptive fields and improve the spatial
proximity of our Voxel Mamba framework. Experiments demonstrated that Voxel Mamba achieved
state-of-the-art results on Waymo and nuScene datasets. Without elaborated optimization, our model
consumed less memory than group-based Voxel Transformer methods, and our group-free strategy
was more efficient and deployment-friendly than group partition. Voxel Mamba provided an efficient
group-free solution for sparse point clouds for 3D tasks.

Limitations. While the proposed Voxel Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud
based 3D object detection, it still has some limitations to be further addressed. First, in the Hilbert
Input Layer, the curve templates occupy approximately 0.1 GB of GPU memory, which may become
substantial as the voxel resolution increases. Besides, a more elaborately designed downsampling and
upsampling operation could improve more the model efficiency. We will investigate these problems
in future work.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See the limitation in Sec. 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

16


---Page Break---
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our paper is easy to follow and we provide implementation details in paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The data and code are available currently.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details in paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

18


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduce the required resource in the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We focus on point cloud-based 3D object detection, which can be applied to
autonomous driving. For positive societal impact, our approach enhances the precision of
3D detection, thereby augmenting the safety aspect of autonomous driving. For negative
societal impact, false detection results can potentially lead to traffic accidents.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

19


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited the related original paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
