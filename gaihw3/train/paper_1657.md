Abstract

This paper investigates the 3D domain generalization (3DDG) ability of large 3D
models based on prevalent prompt learning. Recent works demonstrate the perfor-
mances of 3D point cloud recognition can be boosted remarkably by parameter-
efficient prompt tuning. However, we observe that the improvement on downstream
tasks comes at the expense of a severe drop in 3D domain generalization. To resolve
this challenge, we present a comprehensive regulation framework that allows the
learnable prompts to actively interact with the well-learned general knowledge
in large 3D models to maintain good generalization. Specifically, the proposed
framework imposes multiple explicit constraints on the prompt learning trajec-
tory by maximizing the mutual agreement between task-specific predictions and
task-agnostic knowledge. We design the regulation framework as a plug-and-play
module to embed into existing representative large 3D models. Surprisingly, our
method not only realizes consistently increasing generalization ability but also
enhances task-specific 3D recognition performances across various 3DDG bench-
marks by a clear margin. Considering the lack of study and evaluation on 3DDG, we
also create three new benchmarks, namely base-to-new, cross-dataset and few-shot
generalization benchmarks, to enrich the field and inspire future research. Code and
benchmarks are available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-PRC.

Introduction

3D point cloud data is widely adopted in many industrial and civil areas, such as autonomous
driving [47], robotics [27, 3], geospatial mapping [39] and entertainment games [46]. Recognizing
3D objects from point cloud data is a basic need of these applications. Relevant research topics
have been explored for a long time and their development can be summarized in three stages. In
the early phase, PointNet series [48, 49] sparked a wave of directly operating raw point cloud data
using deep learning techniques. Later methods improved upon PointNet and PointNet++ in terms
of local information aggregation [33, 67, 60, 63, 69, 37], optimization techniques [50], geometry
prior [55], model architecture [18, 82, 68, 44, 14], etc. Although remarkable progress has been made,
these works tend to design specific architectures targeting downstream benchmarks while paying
little attention to the model generalization, resulting in disappointed performances when deploying in
the wild, especially in the case of unseen domains and corrupted data. On the other hand, training
point cloud recognition models on each benchmark is not always feasible due to the narrow set of 3D
visual concepts and expensive labeled data.

The above factors call for the investigation of the domain generalization routes for the deep point
cloud models so that they can learn robust and transferable representations. Related studies have
been extensively conducted in image recognition [28, 29, 31, 30, 32, 87, 13, 84] while to our best
knowledge, there are only a few methods to discuss the domain adaptation and domain generalization
in 3D. Several years ago, PointDAN [51] first investigated domain adaptation for point cloud
classification models by aligning multi-scale features of 3D objects across the source and target
domains. MetaSets [20] proposed to meta-learn on a group of transformed point sets to obtain
generalizable representations to handle the sim-to-real geometry shifts. PDG [64] decomposed 3D
objects into shared part space to reduce domain gap and developed a part-level domain generalization
model for 3D point cloud classification.

However, the above methods are all built on small models (e.g., PointNet with 1.2M pa-
rameters) and small datasets (e.g., ModelNet with 9,843 training samples) and the overall

Figure 1: Motivation of our research: to promote the
performances on downstream 3D tasks while main-
taining good generalization of large 3D models. The
experiments are conducted on ShapeNetCoreV2. ULIP-
2 can reach 71.22% zero-shot recognition accuracy on
this dataset. Recent works built on ULIP-2 introduce
lightweight prompt tuning (PT) to further boost target
tasks (75.80% accuracy). However, we observe the im-
provements come at the expenses of a severe drop in 3D
domain generalization (e.g., 57.07% accuracy on new
classes, much behind 71.22%), and develop a system-
atic regulation constraint (RC) framework to address
this challenge.

transferability is still suppressed compared
to prevalent large 3D foundation mod-
els [76, 90, 71, 78, 77, 79, 72], which have
been pre-trained on numerous volume of
3D data [11, 10] and demonstrated promis-
ing zero-shot capability.
Recent works
stand on the shoulder of large 3D foun-
dation models and push the boundary of
downstream 3d tasks by parameter-efficient
adaptation, such as prompt learning [74,
58], adapter [59, 88], and their combi-
nation.
They insert learnable prompts
in the inputs or adapter inside the Trans-
former [62] blocks to adapt the foundation
models to specific 3D tasks. However, op-
timizing the newly introduced small mod-
ules targeting downstream benchmarks is
prone to overfitting, thus disturbing the in-
ternal representations and compromising
the inherent generalization of the founda-
tion models [85, 36, 89, 26, 24, 25]. As
Fig. 1 demonstrates, lightweight prompt
tuning can notably lift the recognition ac-
curacy of representative large 3D models
on seen classes while hindering the generalization on unseen new classes, where the performances
consistently lag behind corresponding zero-shot predictions of these models.

In this paper, we develop our approach based on large 3D foundation models through lightweight
prompt learning and propose a comprehensive framework that consists of three regulation constraints
to allow the learning trajectory to interact with the well-learned knowledge in large 3D models
actively, achieving better task-specific performances and task-agnostic generalization at the same
time. Specifically, we propose the mutual agreement constraint to regulate the learnable prompts
to produce consistent feature distributions and predictions with the pre-trained foundation models.
Then, we exploit the flexible and diverse text descriptions derived from LLMs or manual templates
to reflect the attributes of different classes of point clouds and enhance the generalization. Finally,
we develop a weighted model ensemble strategy to update the learnable prompts smoothly and
predictably, avoiding giant and unexpected leaps toward overfitting the downstream datasets. Some
recent works also explore parameter-efficient tuning for point cloud analysis [74, 59, 58, 88], they
focus on the performances of downstream tasks while failing to take the model generalization into
account. As far as we are aware, our work initiates the first attempt to impose explicit regulation
constraints and improve the 3D domain generalization based on large 3D models.

In addition, we argue existing 3D domain generalization evaluation benchmarks, such as PointDA [51]
and Sim-to-Real [20], may not be comprehensive to evaluate common generalization capabilities.
Only ∼10 point cloud object classes are included in these benchmarks. They emphasize the gener-
alization among the shared categories between the source and target domain, without considering
transferring to unseen new classes, corrupted data, etc, which are frequent in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, three new benchmarks are created to enrich 3D domain generalization evaluation,
including base-to-new class generalization, cross-dataset generalization and few-shot generalization.
We will dissect the details of benchmark curation and usage in Section A.1. We supply comprehen-
sive experiments and analysis to examine the proposed regulation constraint framework, ablate the
effectiveness of distinct components, and draw some new insights from our newly introduced 3DDG
evaluation benchmarks. The results verify the proposed method not only enhances the task-specific
3D point cloud recognition but also extends the task-agnostic generalization ability by a clear margin.

In short, the contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, to our knowledge, we firstly bring
the 3DDG problem in front of large multi-modal 3D models and present an effective regulation
framework based on lightweight prompt tuning, which not only strengthens downstream 3D task
performances but also lifts the domain generalization capability remarkably. Secondly, we implement
our regulation framework as a plug-and-play module to seamlessly integrate into the existing large
multi-modal 3D models. Consistent improvements are obtained over representative large 3D models,
indicating the proposed regulation framework is general and model-agnostic. Thirdly, we carefully
craft three new benchmarks to enrich the evaluation of 3D domain generalization. Our benchmarks
introduce new evaluation dimensions for 3DDG which are vital in the real world but absent in
existing ones, including base-to-new, cross-dataset, and few-shot generalization. These new and more
challenging benchmarks will drive the future research of 3D domain generalization.

Related Work

3D domain generalization. Although domain generalization has been widely studied in image
recognition [17, 28, 34, 29, 31, 30, 32, 83, 21, 87, 5, 38, 13, 84, 80], it is still not the case for
3D. A large body of works in point cloud recognition focuses on improving the performances
on specific benchmarks by supervised [48, 49, 33, 67, 60, 63, 18, 69, 82, 37, 68, 50, 14, 44] or
self-supervised [73, 43, 75, 57] learning. However, they lack systematic strategies to address the
generalization challenge and related evaluation is absent. Only a few methods investigate the 3D
domain adaptation [51] and domain generalization [20, 64] problem. They either create a common
feature space between the source and target domain (e.g., PointDAN [51], PDG [64]), or utilize
the meta-learning framework (e.g., MetaSets [20]) to obtain robust representations to handle the
domain shifts. Nevertheless, those methods are all built on small-size point cloud encoders targeting
small-scale datasets and the overall generalization is unsatisfactory. In contrast, we explore the
3D domain generalization based on representative large multi-modal 3D models, like PointCLIP
series [76, 90] and ULIP series [71, 72]. Meanwhile, we do not touch the backbone and only conduct
lightweight prompt tuning on those large 3D models.

Prompt learning for large 3D models. Prompt learning for 3D point cloud understanding has
been studied in recent works [74, 58, 59, 88]. IDPT [74], Point-PEFT [59] and DAPT [88] explore
this problem in pure point cloud modality and do not establish connections with flexible language
descriptions, thus these methods cannot conduct open-vocabulary 3D recognition. PPT [58] firstly
constructs a prompt learning pipeline based on the multi-modal framework ULIP [71]. It achieves
open-vocabulary recognition with promising performances and relatively small costs. Our work is
closely related to PPT but distinguished in the following aspects: First, PPT focuses on optimizing
specific 3D tasks with learnable prompts and fails to consider generalization on unseen data. Instead,
our work develops systematic strategies to regulate prompt learning to boost generalization as well as
target tasks. Second, PPT only introduces learnable prompts in the text branch while our method
conducts multi-modal prompt tuning on both text and 3D branches.

Method

We firstly revisit lightweight prompt learning for existing large 3D models in section 3.1. Then, a
comprehensive regulation framework is proposed to promote the generalization capability of large
3D models based on the plug-and-play prompt tuning strategy in section 3.2. Finally, we introduce
the implementation details of the devised method in section 3.3. The overall pipeline of our method
is visualized in Fig. 2. The creation and analysis of our new 3DDG benchmarks are elaborated in
Appendix A.1 due to space limitation.

3.1
Preliminary

Existing large multi-modal 3D models [76, 90, 71, 72] have different branches that encode the inputs
from point cloud and text. In the 3D branch, a point cloud P ∈RN×3 is divided and projected
into u point patches. Then, a class token pcls ∈Rd is inserted before the patches to form the
input P = {pcls, p1, p2, . . . , pu} ∈R(1+u)×d of the 3D encoder fP (·, θp), where θp represents the
encoder parameters. In the text branch, the descriptions of each 3D category are converted into the
sequence T = {tsos, t1, t2, . . . , tv, tc, teos} ∈R(3+v)×d for the text encoder fT (·, θt). Here tc is the
embedding of {class}, tsos and teos stands for the the start and end flag token of a sentence. So
we can obtain the 3D features hP = fP (P, θp) and text features hT = fT (T, θt). When executing
zero-shot recognition for a downstream 3D dataset of C categories, θp and θt are frozen, the model
outputs the class probability distribution D for point cloud P by computing
exp(sim(hP , hT )/τ)
PC
j=1 exp(sim(hP , hj
T )/τ),

where sim(·, ·) measures the cosine similarity of the inputs and τ is a temperature coefficient.

Although zero-shot inference is flexible, the performances on target tasks may not be satis-
factory.
Multi-modal prompt learning introduces learnable prompts in the inputs of different
branches. Specifically, we insert r learnable prompts EP = {eP
1 , eP
2 , . . . , eP
r } ∈Rr×d into P
and s learnable prompts ET = {eT
1 , eT
2 , . . . , eT
s } ∈Rs×d into T, respectively. Thereupon, the
modified inputs for point cloud and text encoder become ˜P = {pcls, p1, . . . , pu, eP
1 , . . . , eP
r } and
˜T = {tsos, t1, t2, . . . , tv, tc, eT
1 , . . . , eT
s , teos}. After transforming by the encoders, we obtain the
new point cloud and text representations denoted with ˜hP = fP (˜P, ˜θp) and ˜hT = fT (˜T, ˜θt), where
˜θp = {θp, EP } and ˜θt = {θt, ET }. Similarly, the predicted class distribution ˜D and optimization
objective can be formulated by Eq. 1.

˜D =
exp(sim(˜hP , ˜hT )/τ)
PC
j=1 exp(sim(˜hP , ˜h
j
T )/τ)
,
{EP ∗, ET ∗} = arg min
{EP , ET }
E(P,y)∼DgtLCE( ˜D, y)
(1)

where Dgt is the ground truth distribution of point cloud data and y is the category of point cloud P.
Note that θp and θt are still frozen and only EP and ET are updatable with the cross entropy (CE)
loss. Also, the learnable prompts can be inserted at each layer of the 3D and text encoder, not only at
the very first layer. We call this scheme deep multi-modal prompt learning that will be regarded as an
important baseline in our experiment settings.

3.2
Our Regulation Framework

Prompt learning aims to elicit well-learned knowledge of pre-trained large models by introducing
a small number of learnable parameters in the input space. But optimizing the learnable prompts
targeting specific datasets easily compromises the general knowledge. To handle the above problems,
we propose a comprehensive regulation framework consisting of three components: mutual agreement
constraint, text diversity constraint, and model ensemble constraint, as elaborated below.

3.2.1
Mutual Agreement Constraint (MAC)

Large foundation models unfold overall better robustness and transferability on a broad spectrum of
evaluations than conventional models learned on specific datasets, supported by representative works
in vision [9], language [53, 54, 4], and multi-modal understanding [52, 23, 15, 45, 86, 85, 90, 71, 19].
The first component of the proposed framework is to interact with large 3D models actively by
maximizing the mutual agreement between learnable prompts and pre-trained knowledge.

Specifically, we engage with large 3D models by aligning extracted features and predicted distributions
simultaneously. Let us denote the frozen point cloud feature extracted by the 3D foundation model
as hP , the point cloud feature containing learnable prompts as ˜hP . Now we compute the difference
between hP and ˜hP and mark it as Lp. Similarly, in the text modality, we have Lt which measures
the difference between hT and ˜hT . On the other side, D and ˜D are two class distributions given
by the frozen and promptable large 3D models, respectively. The difference between D and ˜D
is denoted as LD. Our mutual agreement constraint aims to minimize the feature and prediction
distribution discrepancy to ensure the learning trajectory not to forget the task-agnostic knowledge in
large pre-trained models.

As formulated in Eq. 2, L1 distance is employed to compute Lp and Lt, and Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence is used to characterize the distribution discrepancy. We will examine the design choices in
the ablation study.

3.2.2
Text Diversity Constraint (TDC)

Inspired by the flexibility and versatility of language expressions, we propose to leverage diverse text
descriptions to guide the lightweight prompt tuning to produce transferrable features. Specifically, we
obtain multiple text descriptions for each point cloud object category by prompting LLMs (e.g., GPT-
3.5 [1], GPT-4 [41], PointLLM [70]) or utilizing manual templates. Then, we aggregate the text feature
of all descriptions for each single category by pooling operation, hT = AvgPool(P

j hj
T ), which
will integrate rich semantic information extracted by powerful large models, prevent a point cloud
category biasing towards some specific descriptions and finally enhance the model transferability. In
the case of describing point clouds with LLMs, we design three kinds of prompts, including question
answering, caption generation, and making sentences using keywords, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. For
each instruction to the LLM, we acquire Nt = 10 responses.

responses given by LLMs are regarded as the text descriptions to the point cloud and fed into the text
encoder.

3.2.3
Model Ensemble Constraint (MEC)

The model ensemble constraint aims to synthesize the opinions from different models by weighted
voting to avoid some extreme and failure cases of a single model. The idea has been widely discussed
in statistical machine learning [42, 12] and deep learning [16, 40]. Robust tuning of multi-modal large
models by ensemble learning also has been studied in recent literature [65, 22]. The ensemble strategy
mainly involves interpolating weights between zero-shot and fully fine-tuned large models. But it
has not been investigated in the context of prompt tuning for large 3D models and its effectiveness
is unknown. In this paper, we propose to ensemble models by aggregating the model parameters
in different training epochs with a Gaussian weighted strategy. The basic idea is that in the initial
learning stage, the prompts are randomly initialized and not well optimized so we distribute them very

5


---Page Break---
small weights. As the training iterates, the model gradually gets a sense of downstream tasks; thus,
increasing weights are assigned to the model parameters in these epochs. As the training ends, the
learnable prompts are adjusted well to adapt downstream datasets while having the risk of overfitting,
so we decrease the weights to the model parameters. The varying weights of the above process can
be approximated by a gaussian curve. Finally, the weighted models in different epochs are ensembled
to generate the model parameters ˜θt and ˜θp, shown in Eq. 3.

t, ETi} indicate the model
parameters after the ith epoch of training in the text and point cloud branch, respectively. Note that
a simple accumulated addition can implement Eq. 3 and we do not need to store all e copies of the
parameters, referring to Appendix for details.

Optimization. The overall optimization objective consists of two parts, the task-specific cross entropy
loss LCE and the task-agnostic regulation constraint loss LRC, displayed in Eq. 4, where α, β, γ are
hyperparameters. Unlike trivial prompt tuning a multi-modal large model on downstream tasks, this
design allows the learnable prompts to actively interact and align with the general knowledge in a
pre-trained large model while learning on specific 3D tasks.

L = LCE + LRC,
LRC = αLp + βLt + γLD

3.3
Implementation Details

We choose PointCLIP [71], PointCLIP V2 [71], ULIP [71], and ULIP-2 [72] as the 3D foundation
models for experiments. All experiments are running with three random seeds and we report the
mean and standard deviation. The learnable prompts are inserted into the inputs of first 9 Transformer
layers in these models and the prompt length is set to 2. Unless specified, the prompts are optimized
using 16-shot learning. Note that previous 3DDG methods [51, 20, 64] use the full training set. We
set α = 10, β = 25 and γ = 1. The optimizer is SGD, the initial lr is 0.0025 and we use cosine
scheduler to update it. More details about the model configuration can be found in Appendix. We
will justify the design choices in the ablation study.

Experiments

In this section, we first explain the evaluation settings of our newly curated and existing benchmarks.
Then, comprehensive comparison and analysis across various generalization settings are presented
to show the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, we justify the effectiveness of different
components in our regulation framework through systematic controlled experiments.

4.1
3DDG Evaluation Settings

Base-to-New. This benchmark includes 5 point cloud datasets which are ModelNet40 [2], three vari-
ants of ScanObjectNN [61] (S-PB_T50_RS, S-OBJ_BG, S-OBJ_ONLY) and ShapeNetCoreV2 [6].
Each dataset is equally split into base and new classes, where the former is used for prompt tuning
while the latter only serves the test purpose. Cross-Dataset. This benchmark has four types of
evaluation, including OOD generalization, data corruption, PointDA [51] and Sim-to-Real [20]. We
established the first two assessments and the latter two already existed. For OOD generalization,
models are trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domains. For data corruption,
models are trained on clean ModelNet [2] and tested on the corrupted data in ModelNet-C[56].
Few-Shot. This setting inspects the model generalization in an extremely low-data regime, where
1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 shots are randomly sampled for prompt learning, and the recognition accuracy is
calculated on the whole test set, respectively. The explanations are brief and we encourage the readers
to check the details in Appendix.

Base-to-new Class Generalization

In this benchmark, models are learned on the base classes and evaluated on the test sets of base
and novel classes. In addition to ULIP and ULIP-2, we also implement the same prompt tuning for
PointCLIP [76] (P-CLIP) and PointCLIP V2 [90] (P-CLIP2) for comparison, shown in Tab. 1.

Loss of Generalization in P-CLIP and ULIP Series. We observe notable gaps occur between base
and new class recognition accuracy of P-CLIP, P-CLIP2, ULIP, ULIP-2 when prompt tuning without
the proposed regulation constraints. For instance, P-CLIP2 achieves 93.98% accuracy on the base
classes of ModelNet40 while dropping by 48.77% absolute points on the whole test set of the new
classes, which even lags behind the zero-shot accuracy of the frozen P-CLIP2 (64.22%). The results
are consistent across five datasets, suggesting the loss of generalization of original models.

Lifting the Generalization by Our Framework. As shown in Tab. 1, the proposed framework
composite of three regulation constraints boosts the unseen class recognition accuracy across different
models and datasets by a clear margin, thanks to the active communication and alignment with the
general knowledge in large 3D models. For example, the improvement of the harmonic mean on
ULIP reaches 10.65% absolute points averaged over 5 datasets.

Lifting the Specific 3D Tasks by Our Framework. Surprisingly, the task-specific performances
are not be hindered by the regulation constraints while enhancing the task-agnostic generalization,
referring to the base class accuracy of ULIP+RC and ULIP-2+RC averaged over 5 datasets, increasing
by 4.87% and 5.27%, respectively.

Cross-Dataset Generalization

This setting differs from the base-to-new counterpart where the base and new classes belong to the
same dataset. We present the analysis for OOD generalization and data corruption as below, and put
the comparison on Sim-to-Real and PointDA in Appendix.

OOD Generalization demonstrates the models’ transferability to other unseen domains by learning
from an existing domain. To evaluate on this benchmark, we implement the lightweight prompt
learning for ULIP and ULIP-2 then impose the proposed regulation constraints on them. Prompt
learning for P-CLIP [76] and P-CLIP2 [76] with same settings are also implemented for comparison.
The results are reported in Tab. 2 . By wrapping ULIP and ULIP-2 with the devised framework, we
achieve consistent positive gains on each of the five target domains. The average gains over them are
enlarged with increasing ability of ULIP, e.g., +6.20% for ULIP-2 vs. +1.79% for ULIP. Meanwhile,
we notice that the performances on Omni3D [66] are rather limited and the methods here seem not to

work, especially for P-CLIP series and ULIP (less than 10% accuracy). This dataset contains a large
vocabulary of real 3D objects (216 categories) and exhibits the long-tail attribute. When transferring
the models that learn from a narrow set of 3D object concepts (55 classes in ShapeNetV2) to Omni3D,
they suffer from new 3D concepts thus perform poorly.

Data Corruption are common in point clouds due to complex geometry, sensor inaccuracy and
processing imprecision. We investigate the generalization of the proposed framework on ModelNet-
C [56], which includes common corruptions, such as dropping some parts or adding global outliers.
The compared methods are same as those in OOD generalization and the results are exhibited in
Tab. 3. Our method not only boosts the recognition accuracy on clean data (+1.44% for ULIP and
+1.40% for ULIP-2), but also strengthen the robustness of representative large 3D models against
collapsed data. By averaging on 7 types of corruption, we receive +1.51% and +4.78% gains for
ULIP and ULIP-2, respectively.

4.4
Few-shot Generalization

In this setting, ULIP and ULIP-2 with (w.) and without (w.o.) our regulation constraints (RC) are
compared. As visualized in Fig. 4, the solid lines of ULIP and ULIP-2 exceed the corresponding
dashed lines by clear margins average over 5 datasets, indicating the devised framework strengthens
the 3DDG capability considerably. The advantages are enlarged especially for the extreme 1-shot
learning, e.g., +8.05% acc. for ULIP and +5.39% acc. for ULIP-2. Note that in some cases, e.g.,
on ModelNet40, ULIP-2 w.o. RC (1-shot, 66.63%) even lags behind zero-shot ULIP-2 (71.23%),
implying that simple prompt tuning disturbs the well-learned representations of ULIP-2. In contrast,
the developed framework brings 2.4% absolute improvements over the zero-shot ULIP-2, obtaining
73.63% acc. under the 1-shot setting.

4.5
Ablation Study

In this section, we examine the effectiveness of several critical components in the proposed framework
via a series of controlled experiments. ULIP-2 is adopted as the baseline and we compare the variants
on the base-to-new benchmark and report the harmonic mean (HM) averaged over 5 datasets.

with and without our framework. Zero-shot performances of ULIP and ULIP-2 are marked with star
symbols. The figure in the upper left presents the average results over 5 datasets.

Regulation constraints. Three components in our framework are vital for generalization enhance-
ment. We verify their effectiveness by adding/deleting the components on ULIP-2. The results in
Tab. 4 indicate there exists a notable performance gap (6.91%) between ULIP-2 with and without
the regulation constraints. And the gap can be gradually narrowed down by inserting different
components. For instance, ULIP-2 with the model ensemble constraint lifts the HM from 72.57% to
7.53%, a nearly 5% absolute increase. Although a single mutual agreement or text diversity constraint
may not bring adequate gains, their combination contributes to the generalization improvement
significantly, achieving 79.26% that is close to the performance of the full version of our framework.

Distance metrics in MAC. The mutual agree-
ment among the extracted features with learnable
prompts (e.g. ˜hT and ˜hP ) and the general knowl-
edge in large 3D models (e.g. hT and hP ) can be
implemented in different distance metrics. Here
we explore their effect and report the results in
Tab. 5a. As observed, MAC with MSE distance
attains the best recognition acc. on the base classes.
But when incorporating the performances of new
3D categories into account, the same model with
L1 distance demonstrates overall better generaliza-
tion (76.10% new acc. and 79.48% HM). Thus
we choose L1 as the distance metric in MAC by
default.

experiments investigate the effect of the point cloud descriptions generated from different sources,
including large language models like GPT-3.5 [1], GPT-4 [41], PointLLM [70] and manual templates
(see Appendix for details). As shown in Tab. 5b, point cloud descriptions from general-purpose
LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, bring decent performances on base classes. However, they lag
behind PointLLM regarding new class recognition accuracy by a clear margin (-2.39% for GPT-3.5
and -2.28% for GPT-4). We infer it is due to the fact that PointLLM has seen massive point cloud data
and related text descriptions thus generates more accurate and domain-related responses. Surprisingly,
by combining 64 simple sentences written by human beings [71], ULIP-2 achieves decent base class
accuracy and the best performance on new classes, resulting in even better HM than that of ULIP-2
with LLMs’ descriptions.

The depth and length of learnable prompts. Two variables that should be determined for the
learnable prompts {EP , ET } are the depth of prompt layers D and the length of prompt tokens L.
For simplicity, the prompt depth is kept the same in the point cloud and text encoders, and similarly
for the prompt length. We ablate the two variables and visualize the results in Fig. 5. In general,
increasing the prompt layers promotes the harmonic mean. But it is not always beneficial to deepen
the learnable prompts, e.g. ULIP-2 with D = 12 achieves 78.26% HM, slightly lower than 78.67%
HM of ULIP-2 with D = 9. We also find that it is not necessary to construct very long prompt
tokens to achieve better generalization, e.g., ULIP-2 with L = 2 surpasses other variants average on
5 datasets clearly. Thus we let D = 9 and L = 2 by default.

Conclusion

This paper initializes the efforts of addressing the corrupted generalization of large 3D models
when adapting to downstream 3D tasks by a comprehensive regulation framework. The framework
enables the learnable prompts to actively engage with large 3D models by maximizing the mutual
agreement between task-specific prediction and general knowledge. Consistent generalization gains
are obtained over different large 3D models, suggesting the model-agnostic attribute of the proposed
framework. We also contribute to the study of 3DDG by developing new and more challenging
evaluation benchmarks that will drive further investigation. Nevertheless, this work focuses on the
point cloud recognition, and we plan to discuss the segmentation and detection tasks in future work.

Limitations and Broader Impacts. The proposed framework has demonstrated effectiveness and
scalability on the object-level recognition task but not been validated on the scene-level tasks, such
as 3D semantic segmentation and object detection. Different solutions may be required to handle
scene-level point cloud data. On the other hand, when exploiting the power of LLMs to reflect
critical characteristics of 3D objects, we simply ensemble multiple descriptions through the pooling
operation, more sophisticated prompting and fusion strategy can be developed. For broader impacts,
we are the first to investigate the generalization ability of large multi-modal 3D models, which mirrors
the progress of the vision-language field (CLIP-based image recognition) and probably inspires a
series of follow-up works. We do not perceive the potential negative impacts of this work.

Appendix

A.1
Our New 3DDG Benchmarks

To our knowledge, PointDA [51] and Sim2Real [20] are rare benchmarks in 3DDG. We perceive that existing
3DDG benchmarks may not be sufficient to cover common generalization evaluation scenarios. For instance,
PointDA [51] selected 10 shared classes among three popular point cloud datasets [2, 8, 6] for generalization
evaluation. Sim2Real [20] picked 9 same categories among ShapeNet [6] and ScanObjectNN [61] and 11 shared
classes in ModelNet [2] and ScanObjectNN [61]. Both of them emphasize the generalization among shared 3D
object classes in different datasets. But they fail to consider how to transfer to unseen 3D object classes and
other out-of-distribution scenarios. To alleviate the drawbacks, we develop three new benchmarks, including
base-to-new, cross-dataset, and few-shot generalization to enrich 3DDG evaluation and drive future research.

A.1.1
Construction

Base-to-new Class Benchmark. Inspired by the evaluation settings in 2D vision [85], we take five 3D datasets,
including ModelNet40 [2], three variants of ScanObjectNN [61] (S-PB_T50_RS, S-OBJ_BG, S-OBJ_ONLY),
and ShapeNetCoreV2 [6] to construct the base-to-new benchmark. Each of them are equally divided into two
halves object classes, called base and new classes. Specifically, the first half is regarded as base and the second
half is treated as new. The train, val, test sets are split for the base classes while the new classes only serve the
test purpose. The splitting adopts the official standards of the released datasets if available (e.g., ModelNet40
and ShapeNetCoreV2), otherwise (e.g., 3 variants of ScanObjectNN) we randomly selected 20% samples in the
original training set to be the validation set and keep the remaining 80% as new training set. The original test set
is unchanged to serve as the test set. This arrangement allows the model to be trained on base classes then tested
on new classes so that can measure its generalization on unseen new categories and data.

Cross-Dataset Benchmark. Previous Sim2Real [20] and PointDA [51] evaluate the generalization across totally
shared categories in different datasets. But in real world the source and target domains do not necessarily have
common classes. In this work, we construct the cross-dataset benchmark to expand the generalization evaluation
to broader scopes, which incorporates two newly introduced settings, OOD generalization and data corruption,
and another Sim2Real [20] and PointDA [51]. Note that the last two datasets are released by other researchers
for 3DDG evaluation and we just follow their default settings.

OOD Generalization. In this setting, the source and target domain may not necessarily share common categories.
Also, the number of object classes can be different. ShapeNetCoreV2 [6] is arranged as the source dataset while
ModelNet40 [2], the three variants of ScanObjectNN [61] and Omni3D [66] serve as the target evaluation places.
Apparently, this design is specially for large 3D models that have open-vocabulary recognition ability since
traditional 3DDG methods like MetaSets [20], PDG [64] are only able to recognize a fixed set of point cloud
classes.

Data Corruption. Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to irregular geometry structures, inaccurate sensors or
processing errors. Existing 3DDG benchmarks fail to take this factor into account. We utilize the off-the-shelf
point cloud corruption dataset ModelNet-C [56] as a place to measure the robustness and generalization of point
cloud recognition methods against common data corruptions, such as losing local parts, global noise, etc.

Few-shot Benchmark. This benchmark incorporates same datasets with those in the Base-to-new Class
Benchmark. But we do not distinguish the base and new classes and treat them as a whole. During prompt
learning on each dataset of this benchmark, we randomly sample 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 shots from each category to
tune the learnable prompts, then observe the generalization on the whole test set.

A.1.2
The Evaluation Settings

Base-to-New. This benchmark includes five point cloud datasets as described above. Each dataset is equally
split into base (known) and new (unseen) classes. We compute the recognition accuracy (Acc.) on the two types
of classes, respectively. Although the accuracy on the new classes reflects how well a model can learn from
known point cloud categories to generalize other unseen data, we also want decent accuracy on the base classes.
Consequently, the harmonic mean (HM) between the accuracies of base and new classes is chosen to balance the

two factors. Similar evaluation settings are also adopted in vision-language community [85, 36, 7, 24, 25, 89, 35].
Note that the models trained on a fixed set of point cloud categories cannot be evaluated on this benchmark since
they do not have the open-vocabulary recognition ability, such as IDPT [74], Point-PEFT [59], DAPT [88].

Cross-Dataset. This benchmark has four types of evaluation settings and we will focus on the first two settings
which are, OOD generalization and data corruption, newly introduced in 3DDG by us. The last two correspond
to the default settings in PointDA [51] and Sim-to-Real [20]. For OOD generalization, models are trained on the
source domain and directly transferred to the target domains for evaluation. Recognition accuracy is a major
metric. We will average the accuracies across five target domains to measure the final generalization ability.
For data corruption, models are trained on clean ModelNet [2] and tested on various point cloud corruption
scenarios in ModelNet-C[56], such as add global noises, losing local parts, geometry transformations, etc. The
average accuracies on 7 types of atomic corruptions are computed to measure the model robustness against point
cloud data corruption.

Few-Shot. This setting inspects the model generalization in extremely low-data regime, where only a few
samples of each class are offered to train a model then it is evaluated on the whole test set. Here we take 1, 2, 4,
8, and 16 shots for the model training and the recognition accuracy on the whole test set is compared.

We insert the proposed explicit constraints to large 3D models, then conduct lightweight prompt tuning on
downstream 3D tasks, finally observe whether positive gains will appear in above 3DDG evaluation settings
compared to the same prompt learning but without our regulation framework.

Implementation Details

In gaussian model weighting, we take µ = 15 and σ = 1. To avoid store e separate copies of the model
parameters, we implement Eq. 3 by iteratively adding current and previous epoch of weighted model parameters.
Note the learnable parameters are randomly initialized before training. The design ensures our model absorbing
prior knowledge and reduces disk consumption effectively. Both ULIP and ULIP-2 exploit the Point-BERT [73]
as the backbone.

We use two RTX 4090 GPUs to run the experiments. On the base-to-new benchmark, we conduct prompt
learning for 20 epochs. On the cross-dataset and few-shot benchmark, models are trained for 50 epochs, and the
prompt depth D and length L are set to 12 and 4, respectively. For the evaluation on ModelNet-C, we report
the results when the corruption severity is 2. The 64 manual templates and other 3D object classes descriptions
generated by LLMs are available at our provided codebase.

Additional Results and Analysis

Base-to-new Class Generalization

Table 9 enriches the base-to-new class generalization evaluation by reporting the mean and standard deviation of
three runnings on the base-to-new class benchmark. The standard deviation in the bracket follows the mean.
Note that ULIP and ULIP-2 with our regulation framework have much smaller deviation on novel classes, e.g.,
2.38% vs 3.77%, suggesting better generalization and robustness against the variations between seen and unseen
point cloud data.

on prompt learning. Each number here is the mean of three runnings. Base: base class accuracy
(in %, same below). New: new class accuracy. HM: harmonic mean of base and new class accuracy.

Cross-dataset Generalization

Sim-to-Real evaluation measures the 3D domain generalization from simulating data to real world. This
evaluation was first introduced by MetaSets [20] then followed by PDG [64]. In this setting, ModelNet [2]

and ShapeNet [6] are regarded as synthetic point cloud and ScanObjectNN is constructed based on real-scan
data. Here we implement the proposed regulation framework upon P-CLIP2 [90], ULIP [71], ULIP-2 [72]
and compare with prior state-of-the-art. Note that MetaSets and PDG use the whole training set in the source
domain for supervised learning, whereas our methods only exploit 16-shot prompt tuning. As Tab. 10 shows, our
framework brings consistent generalization improvement on different large 3D models, +0.52% for P-CLIP2,
+5.88% for ULIP and +2.48% for ULIP-2 average on 6 datasets. The enhanced ULIP-2 by the devised framework
also outreaches prior best-performing PDG-D by 5.82%, demonstrating better generalization to real-world point
cloud data.

PointDA is a 3D domain adaptation benchmark introduced by PointDAN [51], which includes 6 evaluation
settings as displayed in Tab. 11. Previous methods like MetaSets [20], PDG [64], I-OODG [81] exploit the
full training data in each setting while we adopt few-shot learning (16 shots). The results suggest the proposed
framework contributes to the enhanced domain adaptation significantly, e.g., almost 10% absolute improvements
for ULIP-2 that leads prior state-of-the-art I-OODG by 6.94%.

A.3.3
The Role of MEC

Selecting the best checkpoint through a validation set is a common way. In theory, this greedy strategy favors
highest performances on the downstream tasks, which means the small number of learnable prompts/parameters
are well adapted to these tasks. It is equivalent to our framework without Model Ensemble Constraint (MEC).

However, purely optimizing the small number of learnable prompts toward target tasks will inevitably hinder the
generalization ability of the large 3D models, as we analyzed in the paper.

We also provide the ablation study to this problem, as the results in Tab. 12 indicates, the method without MEC
has slightly lower accuracy on new classes (75.59% vs 76.10%) and harmonic mean. However, when removing
the factors of MAC and TDC, the role of MEC becomes prominent. It raise the overall performance remarkably,
especially for unseen new classes (5.28% absolute points).

Running Time

We compare the training time between our method and the baselines. The results are shown in Tab. 13. The
proposed method consumes a similar amount of time per epoch compared to the baseline, with a slight increase
due to the inclusion of our framework.

Table 13: Running time comparison of a strong baseline ULIP-2 and the proposed approach.
We conduct prompt learning based on ULIP-2 for 20 epochs on the base-to-new class benchmark,
and the experiments are run three times with different seeds. The settings are consistent with those in
the main paper. Time is counted in seconds for all 20 epochs using a RTX 4090.

The number of learnable parameters of our framework is 16,896 while full fine-tuning ULIP-2 has 82.3M
learnable parameters (only in text and 3D encoder). According to the reported details of ULIP-2, pre-training on
Objaverse [11] utilizes 8 A100 GPUs and takes 1.5 days. So full fine-tuning ULIP-2 is also expensive.

A.3.5
Scalability

We further test our framework on a larger dataset named Objaverse-LVIS and the results are promising. This
dataset is a subset of the recently released Objaverse and only serves as a test set (target domain). Objaverse-LVIS
contains 46,205 point clouds distributed in 1,156 classes, and some classes only have a single object, posing
great challenges to existing point cloud recognition methods. In the experiments, we select representative ULIP
and ULIP-2 as baselines and compare them with the models with our regulation framework. The results in the
Tab. 14 verify the proposed approach can also bring considerable gains (+3.27% absolute points for ULIP-2) on
such a larger and challenging dataset.

Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Refer to Abstract and Section 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Refer to Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper
has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not present a new theory or proof.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

22


---Page Break---
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in
the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide
intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Refer the implement details and Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The data and code are released at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-PRC.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

23


---Page Break---
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Refer to the implementation details in Section 3 and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We run each experiment three times and report the mean and standard deviation, referring
to the tables in Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use two RTX 4090 GPUs to run the experiments, referring to Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.

24

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Before submission, we read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and obey them during this study.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the broader impacts of this work in the last section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: To our knowledge, we do not perceive the potential risks of this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

25

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the same licenses of the used datasets and cite the original paper, referring to
Section 4 and Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release the new benchmarks and provided related README at https://github.
com/auniquesun/Point-PRC.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work does not relate to crowdsourcing and research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

26


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work does not relate to the human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
