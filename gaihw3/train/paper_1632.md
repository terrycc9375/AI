Abstract

Lensless cameras offer significant advantages in size, weight, and cost compared to
traditional lens-based systems. Without a focusing lens, lensless cameras rely on
computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements.
However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward imaging models and
insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To overcome these limita-
tions, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for consistent and photorealistic
lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of our approach ensures data consis-
tency by focusing on accurately reconstructing the low-frequency content with a
spatially varying deconvolution method that adjusts to changes in the Point Spread
Function (PSF) across the camera’s field of view. The second stage enhances pho-
torealism by incorporating a generative prior from pre-trained diffusion models. By
conditioning on the low-frequency content retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion
model effectively reconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in
the lensless imaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method
achieves a superior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to
existing methods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam
and DiffuserCam. Project website: phocolens.github.io.

Introduction

Lensless imaging systems [6] have emerged as a groundbreaking solution for ultra-compact,
lightweight, and cost-effective imaging. They replace lenses by amplitude [3, 4] or phase masks
[1, 5, 20] placed close to the sensor to modulate incoming light. This design significantly reduces
camera size and weight and enables innovative sensor shapes such as spherical [14] or cylindrical.

Considering the raw measurements from lensless cameras are typically blurry and unrecognizable, it
is hard to recover a high-quality image of the original scene. An example of lensless measurement
and recovered images by WienerDeconv [44] is shown in the left column of Fig. 1. Due to the lack of
focusing elements, lensless cameras cannot directly record the scene but encode it into a complex
diffraction pattern. This encoding process can be approximated as a convolution with a large Point
Spread Function (PSF). The PSF acts like a low-pass filter applied to the scene thus introducing
ambiguity, which means there could be multiple possible recoveries for a single measurement.
Therefore, powerful algorithms are critical for high-quality reconstruction in lensless systems.

The primary challenge of a lensless reconstruction is to achieve both photorealism and consistency.
Photorealism requires high-quality reconstruction with rich details, while consistency further re-
quires reconstructed contents to be consistent with the original scene. Traditional techniques, like
WienerDeconv, can reconstruct images that align with the ground truth but visual quality is signifi-
cantly degraded (Fig. 1b). Learning-based approaches such as FlatNet-gen [17] attempt to enhance
visual quality by training with paired images and lensless measurements, yet they often fail to recover
high-frequency details (Fig. 1c). The visual quality can be further improved by the restoration
algorithms using generative priors, like DiffBIR [23] (Fig. 1d). While these restoration methods
can inject rich details, they may also alter image content or insert non-existent objects, breaking
consistency. For example, in Fig. 1d, the beak in the top row has the wrong shape compared to the
ground truth (Fig. 1f), and the leaves in the bottom row look fake.

Moreover, an inaccurate imaging process simulation may also hurt data consistency. Most existing
reconstruction algorithms [17, 27] simplify the imaging process as a convolution with a shift-invariant
PSF. However, in practice, PSFs are spatially varying, particularly when the angle of incidence
increases. Consequently, these areas experience a noticeable drop in the reconstructed similarity to
the original scene, especially in the peripheral field of view.

To achieve both photorealism and consistency, we propose a two-stage lensless reconstruction based
on range-null space decomposition [36]. According to this decomposition, the reconstructed image
consists of two components, one from “range space”, which can be directly calculated from the
lensless measurement (Fig. 1a), and the other from “null space”, which are the detailed textures
lost during the lensless imaging process. Therefore, the first stage prioritizes data consistency by
recovering the “range space” component, which is the low-frequency content that matches the ground
truth. The second stage focuses on photorealism by adding more high-frequency details from the
“null space” while maintaining the consistency established in the first stage.

In the first stage, to improve consistency, we propose a novel spatially varying deconvolution to
reconstruct the “range space” content. Unlike traditional methods that assume a shift-invariant PSF,
our approach automatically adapts to spatial variations in the PSF across the camera’s field of view in
a data-driven manner. This innovation more accurately models the forward imaging process, leading
to better reconstruction of structural integrity and detail in the low-frequency components. Fig. 2
shows improvement with our method (right) against those using a single kernel for deconvolution
(left).

In the second stage, to improve photorealism, we integrate a generative prior using a pre-trained
diffusion model, to insert realistic details into the first-stage output. This model specifically targets
the recovery of high-frequency details lost in the lensless imaging process. We condition the diffusion
model on the low-frequency content reconstructed in the first stage, guiding it to incorporate missing
high-frequency elements from the “null space”. Our supervised approach ensures the final images are
consistent with actual measurements and also achieve photorealistic quality.

Combining these two stages, our lensless reconstruction achieves a good balance between data
consistency and visual quality in the reconstructed images, surpassing existing methods, as shown
in Fig. 1e. To validate this, we compare our method with others on two types of lensless cameras:
PhlatCam [17] and DiffuserCam [27], using metrics that assess both fidelity and visual quality. The
qualitative comparison on the PhlatCam dataset, demonstrating improvements in both aspects, is
shown in Fig. 3, highlighting the superiority of our technique over current methods.

Related Work

Lensless imaging is traditionally addressed by solving regularized least squares problems for convolu-
tional imaging models, often incorporating sparsity constraints like those in the gradient or frequency
domain [1, 5, 21, 31]. Deep learning has revolutionized lensless imaging by enabling learnable
deconvolution parameters and perception enhancement through image-to-image networks. Recent
innovations include deep unrolled techniques [19, 27, 49], alongside feed-forward deconvolution
methods in image space [17] or in feature space [22]. However, these methods generally assume a
constant point spread function in the imaging process. Our proposal introduces a spatially varying
deconvolution approach to overcome this limitation and achieve more precise image reconstruction.

Spatially-varying deconvolution has been a well-studied area [11, 24, 46] due to the prevalence of
imaging systems with PSFs that vary across the FoV. However, these methods [2, 20, 25, 29, 47]
are often slow, computationally intensive, and result in poor image quality, especially in complex
systems. Recently, MultiWienerNet [48] introduced a deep learning approach for fast, spatially
varying deconvolution, but it requires tedious multi-location PSF calibrations. In contrast, our
spatially varying deconvolution method, designed for lensless imaging, leverages a single initial PSF
and automatically learns variations across the image, eliminating the need for extensive calibration.

Inverse imaging with diffusion models can be categorized as supervised or zero-shot. Supervised
methods train a conditional diffusion model [8, 13, 12, 32, 50] with paired images to bridge the
gap between input and desired outputs, leveraging generative priors for inverse imaging [35, 39]
and controlled generation [28, 34]. On the other hand, zero-shot methods [37] employ guidance
to address a wide range of general inverse problems [9, 38]. These techniques typically rely on
predefined conditions for guidance. Specific models like DDRM [15] and DDNM [41] focus on
mathematical decompositions to improve the diffusion process. Our work integrates the strengths of
both approaches, combining supervised fine-tuning with a theoretical framework based on range-null
space decomposition, aiming for a robust solution to inverse imaging challenges.

Preliminary

3.1
Range-Null Space Decomposition

The lensless imaging process can be formulated as a linear transformation [10]. Specifically, given
a scene plane x ∈RM 2, the sensor measurements ˆy ∈RN2 is expressed as ˆy = Ax + n. Here,
A ∈RN 2×M 2 is the transfer matrix of the lensless imaging system, and n is the sensor noise. The
transfer matrix A essentially encodes how light from each point on the scene plane contributes to
each sensor pixel. Given a calibrated camera system, the transfer matrix A is known and the objective
of lensless reconstruction is to recover the scene plane image x (like Fig. 1f) from the measurement
(like Fig. 1a). For simplicity, below we consider a noise-free case as y = Ax.

We then introduce range-null space decomposition. Let A† ∈RM 2×N2 be the pseudo-inverse of the
linear matrix A, which satisfies AA†A ≡A. The operation A†A can be interpreted as a projection
onto the range space of A because for any sample x, we have AA†Ax = Ax. In contrast, the
operation (I −A†A) acts as a projection onto the null space of A, given that A(I −A†A)x = 0.
Therefore, any sample x can be decomposed into two orthogonal components: one that lies in the

range space of A, and the other in the null space of A. Mathematically, this decomposition is:

  \mat h bf  {x} \equiv \mathbf {A}^{\dag }\mathbf {A}\mathbf {x} + (\mathbf {I} - \mathbf {A}^{\dag }\mathbf {A})\mathbf {x}, 
(1)

where A†Ax is the range space component, and (I −A†A)x is the null space component.

Through this decomposition, we derive two distinct elements indicative of consistency and photo-
realism. The “range space” term A†Ax ensures consistency, as its multiplication by A yields the
measurement y, fulfilling the consistency condition Ax = y. Conversely, the “null space” term
(I −A†A)x ensures that the reconstructed image ˆx aligns with natural image statistics.

3.2
Mismatch in Convolutional Lensless Imaging Model

In lensless literature, most researchers [1, 5, 17, 27] simplify the imaging process as a convolution,
because the full transfer matrix A ∈RN2×M 2 is too large to compute. Specifically, the measurement
y is obtained as y = h ∗x, where h is the point spread function (PSF) of the lensless system and ∗
denotes the convolution. Most previous reconstruction algorithms are based on this assumption.

However, the real lensless imaging model is not simply a spatially invariant convolution as shown in
Fig. 4a. Consider a lensless camera consisting of a mask placed at the longitudinal position z = 0
and a sensor placed at z = d. Let U(x, y, z) be a complex scalar wave field, a complex function of
transverse coordinates x, y, and longitudinal position z. Denote the wave field immediately after
propagating through the mask from a point source at infinity with an incident angle θ as Uθ(ξ, η, 0+).
Using the Huygens-Fresnel principle [10], the intensity pattern pθ(x, y) captured by the sensor is:

  p_\ th e ta (x, y)  = | U
_\th
e
ta (

x,
y,d)| ^2  =\ left |\frac 
{d}{

j
\lambda r^2}\iint U_\theta (\xi ,\eta ,0^+)\exp (jkr)d\xi d\eta \right |^2, \label {eq:huygens} 
(2)

where the distance r is given by r =
p

d2 + (x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2 and λ is the wavelength of light.

Therefore, according to Eqn. 2, the spatially invariant convolutional imaging model only satisfies
under the Fresnel approximation [5, 10]:

  
r

 =  \s q rt { d^ 2  + ( x  - \ xi )^2 +  (y  - \eta )^2} \approx d + (x - \xi )^2/(2d) + (y - \eta )^2/(2d). 
(3)

This approximation is valid only when the distance d between the lensless mask and the sensor is
large enough to satisfy d ≫
p

(x −ξ)2 + (y −η)2. However, most lensless masks are very close to
the sensor (d = 2mm in a typical lensless camera), breaking this assumption.

This mismatch can lead to inaccuracies [26, 43, 52] in the convolutional imaging model. To demon-
strate that, we simulate the PSF of a typical lensless camera (Phlatcam [5]) across various incident
angles θ using Eqn. (2). As shown in Fig. 4b, PSFs at different angles (0°, 15°, and 30°) are visually
different. Quantitatively, Fig. 4c shows the similarity between PSFs at the center and -30° drops from
1.0 to 0.7.

Figure 5: System Overview. The two-stage pipeline begins with a spatially varying deconvolution

To further show the consequences of this mismatch, we simulate lensless capture from a clean scene
image (Fig. 4d top), with the accurate spatially-varying PSF based on Eqn. (2), but solve the inverse
imaging problem using a simple convolutional model using the PSF at the center. Fig. 4d bottom
shows the result, and there are more artifacts at the boundary (red box) than at the center (green box).
This is because the mismatch between the actual PSF and the single PSF used for deconvolution is
more significant at the periphery field of view.

Method

In this section, we introduce PhoCoLens, a method for achieving both Photorealistic and Consistent
reconstruction in Lensless imaging. As illustrated in Fig. 5, PhoCoLens consists of two main stages:
range space reconstruction and null space recovery. We will first introduce the whole framework and
then provide a detailed explanation of each stage.

Given an input lensless measurement ˆy = Ax + n, where y = Ax is the noise-free part of the
lensless measurement, A is the transfer matrix of the lensless camera, x is the original scene we aim
to reconstruct, and n is the sensor noise. The objective in lensless image reconstruction is to recover
a photo-realistic image ˆx which satisfies Aˆx = y.

Inspired by the range null space decomposition in section 3.1, we can decompose any potential
solution ˆx into two orthogonal components: the range space component that maintains consistency
and null space component that maximizes photorealism. Formally, this decomposition is given by
ˆx = A†Ax + (I −A†A)¯x, where A†Ax is the range space component and (I −A†A)¯x is the null
space component. Note that any choice of ¯x satisfies the equation Aˆx = y, as A(I −A†A)¯x = 0.

With this decomposition, we reconstruct the range space and null space components in two stages, as
illustrated in Fig. 5. In the first stage, we recover the range space content represented by A†Ax from
the noisy lensless measurement ˆy. Specifically, we propose SVDeconv, a physics-inspired Spatially-
Varying Deconvolution Network that learns to reconstruct the range space content effectively. The
second stage focuses on adding the null space content represented by (I −A†A)¯x. For this purpose,
we introduce null space diffusion, a conditional diffusion model designed for null space recovery. By
conditioning on the range space reconstruction obtained from the first stage, the null space diffusion
enhances these images by incorporating the null space content, thereby rendering them with a more
realistic appearance. Below we introduce each stage.

4.1
Spatially-varying Deconvolution Network

In the first stage, we use SVDeconv, a novel network designed to invert the forward lensless imaging
model and reconstruct the range space content A†Ax from a lensless measurement ˆy = Ax+n with
noise n. SVDeconv is composed of two main components: a differentiable multi-kernel deconvolution
layer and a refinement U-Net, as depicted in the gray box at the bottom left corner of Fig. 5.

---Page Break---
Traditional lensless imaging methods often employ a single PSF to model the imaging system, which
is inaccurate for large field of view (FoV) scenarios as analyzed in section 3.2. To address this,
SVDeconv utilizes a set of learnable K × K PSF kernels, accounting for spatial variations across
the field of view. Specifically, we partition the target image region into a grid of K × K segments,
and for each, we apply an individual PSF kernel. This process results in K × K deconvolution
operations, producing K × K intermediate deconvolved images, as shown in Fig. 5. The multi-kernel
deconvolution is mathematically described as a Hadamard product in the Fourier domain:

  \m
at h bf {x}^{(i) } _{\math r m  { de }} =  \ mathcal {F}^{-1}(\mathcal {F}(\mathbf {p}^{(i)}) \odot \mathcal {F}(\mathbf {\mathbf {\hat y}}) ), i = 1,2,..., K \times K, 
(4)

where x(i)
de is the i-th deconvolution results of the i-th learnable PSF kernel p(i), F(.) and F−1(.)
are the DFT and the Inverse DFT operations, and ⊙denotes the Hadamard product.

From this deconvolution operation, we obtain K × K intermediate deconvolved images. Assuming
that each image accurately reconstructs a specific region of the target image corresponding to its
PSF’s field point, we propose to integrate these images into a single, unified intermediate image using
an innovative interpolation method. The interpolation is expressed as:

  \math bf  

{x
}

_{\
text {int}}
(u ,v)  = \sum _{i=1}^{K^2}w_i(u,v) \mathbf {x}^{(i)}_{\text {de}}(u,v), 
(5)

where u, v are coordinates. The weight wi(u, v) for each deconvolved image x(i)
de is inversely
proportional to the distance between the point (u, v) and the focal center of each corresponding PSF,
formally defined as:

  w_i (u ,
v
)  

=
 
\fr ac
 {d
_i^ {
- \

f
r
ac {1
} {2}} (u,v) }{ \ su m  _{j = 1} ^ {K^2}d_j^{-\frac {1}{2}}(u,v)}, \mathrm {with} \enspace d_i(u,v) = (u-u_i)^2 + (v-v_i)^2. 
(6)

In this way, it ensures that wi(u, v) normalizes the contribution of each deconvolved image based on
inverse Euclidean distance to each point (ui, vi), which represents the center of the FoV corresponding
to the i-th learnable PSF kernel p(i). This weighted sum effectively interpolates the intermediate
images to form a unified representation with enhanced clarity and detail across the entire FoV.

One advantage of this weight design is that it significantly simplifies the calibration process. Previous
multi-kernel methods, such as [48], often require multiple calibrated PSFs at different focal centers,
leading to a time-consuming calibration process. On the contrary, our approach only requires one
calibrated PSF to initialize all kernels. This is because we pre-define the center of the PSF and allow
the model to learn its variations automatically.

After the interpolation, the intermediate image xint is fed into the refinement U-Net [33], removing
noise and artifacts in the reconstruction to approximate the range space content A†Ax. We employ a
combination of MSE loss and LPIPS loss [51] to train both the learnable PSFs and U-Net.

4.2
Null Space Content Recovery

With the reconstructed range space content, we aim to recover a final image that maintains consistency
and improves photorealism. To ensure consistency, the difference between the final image and the
range space content (residual content) should reside in the null space, which ensures the final image
aligns with the original lensless measurement. To improve photorealism, the combination of the null
space and range space content should appear as a realistic real-world image.

To achieve both objectives, we propose null-space diffusion, which takes the reconstructed range
space content as the condition and generates an image that adheres to both constraints. It ensures the
residual content lies in the null space while maintaining its ability to produce realistic images.

To ensure the outputs from null-space diffusion meet the consistency requirement, we train the model
such that the residual content of these samples falls within the null space. Mathematically, if we
denote the output as ex, it should satisfy the following equation when conditioned by A†Ax:

  \l a bel { e q
:c
ons i st e n
cy
} \m a th b f {A}(\mathbf {\widetilde {x}} - \mathbf {A}^{\dagger }\mathbf {A}\mathbf {x}) = \mathbf {0} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathbf {A}\mathbf {\widetilde {x}} - \mathbf {A}\mathbf {x} = \mathbf {0} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathbf {A}(\mathbf {\widetilde {x}} - \mathbf {x}) = \mathbf {0}. 
(7)

Recall that A is the transfer matrix of the lensless camera and A† is its pseudo-inverse. This equation
indicates that applying the operator A to the difference between the generated sample ex and the
original sample x results in zero. This ensures that the residual content resides in the null space of A.

6


---Page Break---
Based on this, we design the null space diffusion as follows. Given an image x and its corresponding
range space content c = A†Ax, we add noise progressively to the image resulting in a noisy image
xt, where t is the noise addition iteration. Similar to other conditional diffusion models [50], we train
a network ϵθ to predict the noise added on the noisy image xt with the optimization objective:

 \l
a
bel { e q:d
i
ffusion} \min _\theta \mat hc al  {L}_{
\rm {null}} = \min _\theta \mathbb E_{\mathbf {x},t,\mathbf {c},\epsilon \sim \mathcal {N}(0,1)}[||\mathbf {A}(\epsilon _\theta (\mathbf {x}_t,t,\mathbf {c}) - \epsilon )||^2_2], 
(8)

which is derived to align with the goal in Eqn. (7). More details are in the Appendix.
Additionally, to ensure the null-space diffusion produces realistic images according to given condi-
tions, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model such as Stable Diffusion [32] with its weights frozen.
We focus on training supplementary conditioning modules to guide the generative process using range
space conditions while preserving its powerful ability to generate realistic images. Specifically, we
follow the StableSR [40] structure, which involves using a conditional encoder to extract multi-scale
features from the range space condition and then using them to modulate the intermediate feature
maps of the residual blocks in the diffusion model. This modulation can align the generated images
with the range space conditions, enhancing the fidelity and realism of output images.

Experiments

In this section, we assess the performance of our proposed method using two lensless imaging
datasets, collected in real-world environments by two different kinds of lensless cameras: PhlatCam
[5] and DiffuserCam [1]. PhlatCam employs a phase mask, while DiffuserCam utilizes a diffuser
for its lensless mask. We compare our approach with other methods and conduct a comprehensive
ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our design.

5.1
Dataset and Metrics

The PhlatCam dataset [17] contains 10,000 images across 1,000 classes resized to 384×384 pixels.
Images are displayed and captured using a lensless PhlatCam [5], generating images at 1280 × 1480
pixels. We use 990 classes for training and 10 classes for testing, following the original protocol.

The DiffuserCam dataset [27] contains 25,000 paired images captured simultaneously using a standard
lensed camera (ground truth) and a mask-based lensless camera DiffuserCam [1]. These pairs are
split into 24,000 images for training and 1,000 for testing. Both cameras utilize sensors with a native
resolution of 1080×1920 pixels, which are first downsampled to 270×480 pixels and then further
cropped to a final resolution of 210×380 pixels for proper display.

To evaluate both consistency (fidelity) and photorealism (visual quality), we employ two metric sets:

• Full-reference metrics to evaluate the consistency. Three full-reference metrics, PSNR, SSIM
[42], and LPIPS [51], are used to evaluate the distance between the network output and ground
truth, which indicates the fidelity of the reconstruction.
• Non-reference metrics to evaluate the photorealism. Three non-reference metrics, ManIQA [45],
ClipIQA [39], and MUSIQ [16], are used to evaluate the visual quality of reconstructed images.

5.2
Implementation Details

For SVDeconv, we utilize 3 × 3 PSF kernels for deconvolution. We initialize the 9 kernels using a
single calibrated PSF from both the DiffuserCam and PhlatCam datasets. The U-Net component in
SVDeconv is adapted from the U-Net used in Le-ADMM-U for training on the DiffuserCam, and
from the U-Net in FlatNet-gen for the PhlatCam. We train the network for 100 epochs with a batch
size of 5, using the Adam optimizer [18]. The learning rate is set to 3e-5 for U-Net training in both
datasets. For deconvolution kernel training, the learning rate is set at 4e-9 for PhlatCam and 3e-5
for DiffuserCam. We set the MSE and LPIPS loss weights to be 1 and 0.05, respectively. In the
DiffuserCam dataset, where the measurements are cropped by the sensor’s limited size, we employ
replicate padding [17] which expands the width and height of the measurements by a factor of two.

For null-space diffusion, we use the range space content reconstructed by SVDeconv as input condi-
tions. We train it for 200 epochs, following the training and inference settings used in StableSR[39].

In the first stage, SVDeconv is trained using range-space content derived from ground truth images.
SVDeconv consists of two main parameter components: a learnable deconvolution kernel initialized

SVDeconv processes input lensless measurements to estimate the range-space content of training
samples. Subsequently, we use this estimated range-space content as input conditions for fine-tuning
via null-space diffusion. During diffusion fine-tuning, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model with
frozen weights. We only train the supplementary conditioning modules like StableSR [35], to guide
the reconstruction process effectively.

Comparison with Other Approaches

We evaluate the performance of our proposed method by comparing it against both traditional and
learning-based approaches, using qualitative and quantitative measures on the two datasets.

We compare traditional methods like Tikhonov regularized reconstruction in the Fourier domain
(WienerDeconv [44]) and total variation regularization via ADMM [7]. Additionally, we evaluate
learning-based methods like the unrolled network Le-ADMM-U [27], MMCN [49], and UPDN [19]
and the feedforward deconvolution method FlatNet-gen. Additionally, we assess two diffusion-based
methods: one uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion [32] with a zero-shot inverse imaging sampling
method DDNM+ [41], and another enhances outputs from FlatNet-gen using a pre-trained blind

image restoration model DiffBIR [23]. Quantitative results are summarized in Tab. 1. Qualitative
comparisons for PhlatCam and DiffuserCam are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.

On the PhlatCam dataset, our method achieves the best performance on both fidelity (full-reference
metrics) and visual quality (non-reference metrics) according to Tab. 1, This is further supported by
the qualitative results in Fig. 6, where our reconstruction are the closest to the ground truth.

For the DiffuserCam dataset, our method achieves superior performance in consistency metrics
(full-reference metrics, SSIM, and LPIPS). While UPDN achieves a slightly higher PSNR, the visual
quality of its outputs suffers from artifacts, as shown in Fig. 7. This slight PSNR drop in our method
is likely due to artifacts within the DiffuserCam ground truth itself, such as moiré patterns. These
artifacts can penalize high-quality images with a lower PSNR, despite their good visual consistency.
This is further evidenced by the visual comparison in Fig. 7. Conversely, FlatNet+DiffBIR, though
achieving higher quality metrics (non-reference metrics, ManIQA, ClipIQA, and MUSIQ), fails to
maintain data consistency (low full-reference metrics, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS). Also, as shown
Fig. 7, FlatNet+DiffBIR sometimes badly distorts the original image content, like transferring a
human hand into clothes in the top row. Overall, our method achieves the best trade-off between the
data consistency and the visual quality. And thanks to the introduction of SVDencov, our method can
reconstruct the field-of-view periphery better than other methods.

Analysis and Discussion

Effectiveness of Spatially-varying Deconvolution. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SVDe-
conv, we compare it with other learnable deconvolution approaches. Baselines include Le-ADMM-U
(a deep unrolled network implementing ADMM), SingleDeconv (using a single deconvolution kernel),
and MultiWienerNet [48](employing multiple deconvolution kernels without weighted interpolation,
initialized similarly to our approach with a single PSF). We focus on two types of content reconstruc-
tion: range space content reconstruction, where range space content is the target, and original content

reconstruction, using the original ground truth as the target. For a fair comparison, all methods utilize
the same U-Net for denoising and perceptual enhancement and the same loss for training. Results in
Tab. 2 show the efficacy of the proposed spatially-varying deconvolution in the faithful reconstruction
of both range space content and original content. Further, Fig. 8 shows our method outperforms
others, particularly in reconstructing fine details at the periphery (circled by white dashed boxes).

Effectiveness of Null-space Diffusion. Following the reconstruction of range space content, we
perform null space content recovery conditioned on the previously reconstructed range space content.
We compare our null-space diffusion model with other approaches, including conditional diffusion
models like DiffBIR [23] and StableSR [39], as well as the zero-shot inverse imaging method
DDNM [41]. Quantitative results in Tab. 3 and qualitative comparison in Fig. 9 demonstrate that our
null-space diffusion performs the best in both consistency with the ground truth and visual quality.

Effectiveness of Range Content Conditions. One important design of our framework is to use the
first stage reconstruction as the condition for the second stage diffusion. To evaluate the effectiveness
of these conditions, we perform an ablation study where we replace our reconstructed range content
with the outputs from WienerDeconv, FlatNet-gen, and the SVD-OC (SVDencov trained with original
content), and re-train the conditional diffusion models using these conditions. As evident from
Fig. 10, our range content condition significantly improves reconstruction consistency compared to
others. This is because using output from models like FlatNet-gen introduces additional artifacts that
hinder the second stage from recovering the original image. Furthermore, quantitative analysis in
Tab. 4 confirms this observation. Our method outperforms these conditions in all fidelity metrics.

Conclusion and Limitation

We present PhoCoLens, an innovative two-stage approach for achieving photorealistic and consistent
reconstructions in lensless imaging. The method leverages the strengths of two complementary
approaches: spatially varying deconvolution for the range space ensures consistency, while null-space
diffusion for the null space guarantees photorealism. Our experiments on two lensless cameras
demonstrate PhoCoLens’ effectiveness in reconstructing realistic scenes while preserving fidelity.
One limitation of our approach is that the two-stage nature of PhoCoLens and the diffusion model’s
sampling time hinder its real-time applicability. Additionally, although PhoCoLens achieves the best
fidelity, the diffusion model we used may still introduce high-frequency details that deviate from
the original scene, particularly for smooth scenes lacking in detail. Future work will focus on two
main aspects: accelerating the diffusion model sampling process to enable real-time photo and video
capture with lensless cameras, and exploring 3D spatially varying point spread function (PSF) effects
to capture 3D scene information.

Appendix

A
PhlatCam Simluation

In section 3.2, we simulate a PhlatCam to interpret the detail of mismatch in a convolutional lensless
imaging model. Here we explain how to simulate a lensless camera like PhlatCam.

Following previous work [5], our simulation begins by constructing a desired point spread function
(PSF) based on the contours generated from random Perlin noise [30]. Given a specific distance
between the mask and sensor, we optimize the phase mask to produce a PSF that matches the target.
For this optimization, we employ the near-field phase retrieval algorithm (NfPR) [5]. This iterative
algorithm alternates between the fields at the mask plane and the sensor plane, enforcing specific
constraints at each location: the field amplitude at the mask plane is set to unity, and the intensity
of the field at the sensor plane conforms to the target PSF. The algorithm utilizes forward Fresnel
propagation for computing the field from the mask to the sensor plane and applies backward Fresnel
propagation to compute from the sensor back to the mask. The inputs required for phase mask
optimization include the target PSF, the mask-to-sensor distance (1mm in our setup), and the light
wavelength, which in this case is set to 532 nm, a typical wavelength in the mid-visible spectrum.

Fig. A1 illustrates the target PSF, the optimized phase mask, and the simulated PSF resulting from
the Fresnel propagation method applied to the designed phase mask. Given a desired phase mask, we
can accurately simulate the lensless imaging process under various situations.

B
Range Space Content Approximation

In the first stage of our method (section 4.1), we want to reconstruct the range-space projection
A†Ax from the lensless measurement ˆy. This reconstruction requires the known target A†Ax
corresponding to the given image x. However, for real-world lensless imaging systems, directly
obtaining the transfer matrix A ∈RN 2×M 2 is computationally infeasible due to its considerable size.
Consequently, we resort to simulating the realistic lensless imaging process using an approximate
form of A and emulate its pseudoinverse A† by inverting this approximation.

In cases where a single point spread function (PSF) h is calibrated, we approximate the forward
imaging process as follows:

  \m a thb f  { y }_{\rm sim} = C(\mathbf {h} * \mathbf {x}) + \mathbf {n}, 
(A1)

where C denotes the cropping operation due to the limited sensor size, ∗represents the convolution
operator, and n represents both sensor and quantization noise. In our practical implementation, the
simulated ysim is quantized to 12 bits, and sensor noise is introduced to achieve a signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of 30.

The approximation for A† is derived by reversing the forward process, specifically by applying
replicate padding to counteract the cropping and employing a Wiener deconvolution to reverse the
convolution:

  \mat h bf {x}_{\r m range} = D(P(\mathbf {y}_{\rm sim}), \mathbf {h}), 
(A2)

14


---Page Break---
where the P represent replicate padding and the D represent Wiener deconvolution.

If multiple calibrated PSFs are available across different fields of view (FoV), the imaging forward
process is better approximated by employing a low-rank model to mimic the spatially varying
convolution. Correspondingly, the spatially varying deconvolution model discussed in section 4.1
could be utilized to simulate A†.

In our PhlatCam and DiffuserCam setups, we only have a single calibrated PSF. Therefore, we
constitute the range-space content of image x using the simple convolutions. It’s important to note
that even without multiple calibrated PSFs for a more accurate simulation, the generated range-space
content remains a good approximation of the real counterpart. As shown in Section 5.4, our simulation
still serves as better supervision compared to the original image content in the first stage.

low-frequency structure of the original scene and lost some high-frequency details from the lensless
imaging process.

Fig. A3 shows the visual examples of range space content estimated by our method. The outputs
from SVDeconv exhibit high visual consistency with the ground truth, as highlighted in the green
boxes, in contrast to those from FlatNet. FlatNet alters the original scene’s content and introduces
incorrect high-frequency details. Conversely, our method preserves only the low-frequency content
in the range space, aligning closely with the original ground truth.

C
Training Target for the Null-space Diffusion Model

In section 6, we establish that the goal articulated in Eqn. (7) corresponds directly to the optimization
objective described in Eqn. (8) used for diffusion training. We provide a detailed derivation to support
this equivalence.

Diffusion models [32] can be characterized by a signal-to-noise ratio defined by two sequences
 (\al
pha _t)_{t=1}^T and  (\si
gma _t)_{t=1}^T . Given a data sample  \mathbf {x}_0 , the forward diffusion process  q can be expressed as:

  q( \ mat h bf { x }_t \ mi
d  \mathbf {x}_0) = \mathcal {N}(\mathbf {x}_t \mid \alpha _t \mathbf {x}_0, \sigma _t^2 \mathbb {I}), 
(A3)

where  \mathcal {N} denotes the normal distribution.

The Markov property of the diffusion is given as:

  q( \ mat h bf { x }_t \mi d 
\mathbf {x}_s) = \mathcal {N}(\mathbf {x}_t \mid \alpha _{t|s} \mathbf {x}_s, \sigma _{t|s}^2 \mathbb {I}),

ha _t}{\alpha _s} \quad \text {and} \quad \sigma _{t|s}^2 = \sigma _t^2 - \alpha _{t|s}^2 \sigma _s^2. 
(A5)

Given  \ m athb f  {x}_t = \alpha _t \mathbf {x}_0 + \sigma _t \epsilon , and a range space condition  \ mathbf {c} = \mathbf {A}^\dagger \mathbf {A} \mathbf {x} , the diffusion output  \widetilde {\mathbf {x}} can be
modeled by  \ w idetil de  {\mathbf {x}} = x_\theta (\mathbf {x}_t, \mathbf {c}, t) . To ensure reconstruction consistency such that  \ma t hbf  {A}(\widetilde {\mathbf {x}} - \mathbf {x}_0) = \mathbf {0} in
Eqn. (7), the optimization objective is defined as:

  \
m
in _\theta \math
b
b {E}_{\m at hb f  {x}_

,
 t, \mathbf {c}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal {N}(0,1)} \left [ \| \mathbf {A}(x_\theta (\mathbf {x}_t, \mathbf {c}, t) - \mathbf {x}_0) \|_2^2 \right ]. 
(A6)

Following previous work [12], we employ the reparameterization of the reconstruction term as a
denoising objective:

  \eps il on  _\ t heta (\m at hb

f 
{x}_t,\mathbf {c},t) = \frac {\mathbf {x}_t - \alpha _t x_\theta (\mathbf {x}_t,\mathbf {c},t)}{\sigma _t}, 
(A7)

to minimize:

  \
m
in _\ t heta \mathcal {L
}
_{\rm {nu ll }}  = \m
a
t
hbb {E}_{\mathbf {x}_0, t, \mathbf {c}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal {N}(0,1)} \left [ \| \mathbf {A}(\epsilon _\theta (\mathbf {x}_t, \mathbf {c}, t) - \epsilon ) \|_2^2 \right ], 
(A8)

which is exactly the Eqn. (8).

Due to the substantial computational cost associated with simulating the transfer matrix A, an
alternative optimization objective can be employed in practice. Specifically, we can approximate the
goal described in Eqn. (8) using the following optimization formulation:

  \
m
in _\the t a \mathcal {L}_{
\
rm {null _{ ap p }}} 
=
 
\mathbb {E}_{\mathbf {x}_0, t, \mathbf {c}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal {N}(0,1)} \left [ \| (\epsilon _\theta (\mathbf {x}_t, \mathbf {c}, t) - \epsilon ) \|_2^2 \right ].

Broader Impacts

Lensless imaging algorithms represent a significant advancement in camera technology, offering both
promising benefits and potential drawbacks for society. On the positive side, these algorithms facilitate
the development of cameras that are smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient. This can greatly
expand their applicability in various fields, particularly in medical contexts where the miniaturization
of imaging devices is crucial. For example, tiny lensless cameras could be integrated into endoscopic
tools for less invasive procedures, improving patient outcomes and recovery times. Furthermore, such
compact cameras could be used in wearable technologies to monitor health conditions continuously,
providing real-time data to both patients and healthcare providers.

However, the proliferation of small, lensless cameras also introduces potential negative societal
impacts, particularly concerning privacy. The ease with which these discreet cameras can be incorpo-
rated into everyday environments raises the possibility of misuse, such as unauthorized surveillance
or covert photography. This concern is particularly acute in private spaces where individuals expect a
high level of privacy. As such, while lensless imaging technology promises significant advancements
in fields like healthcare, it also necessitates stringent regulations and ethical guidelines to prevent
invasive use and protect individual privacy rights.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction accurately reflect the contributions and scope.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitations are discussed in section 6.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the
paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to
provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

19


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear
in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to
provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experi-
mental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the
paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For details on reproducing the experimental results, please refer to section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might
suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary
to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide
access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish
this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the
results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a
model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either
be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model
(e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code and data will be available on the project website.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.

20


---Page Break---
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The implementation details of the experiments are provided in section 5.2.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We report the experiment results using the standard conventions in lensless imaging
research, consistent with previous studies.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of
errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experi-
ments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Evrey experiment can be completed within two days using a server equipped with
eight NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs, a 64-core CPU, 256GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it
into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We strictly adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The broader impacts of our work are explained in appendix E.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to par-
ticular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative
applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that
an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for
disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for
optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.

22


---Page Break---
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for
monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time,
improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators,
or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We will not release data or models that have a high risk for misuse.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere
to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly
respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite all original papers and make sure that our usage is legal.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not introduce new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.

23


---Page Break---
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create
an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as
details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of
the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the
main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Sub-
jects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals
(or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were
obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly
state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
