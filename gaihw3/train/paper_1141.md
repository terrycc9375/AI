Abstract

Although pre-trained transformers and reprogrammed text-based LLMs have shown
strong performance on time series tasks, the best-performing architectures vary
widely across tasks, with most models narrowly focused on specific areas, such
as time series forecasting. Unifying predictive and generative time series tasks
within a single model remains challenging. We introduce UNITS, a unified multi-
task time series model that utilizes task tokenization to integrate predictive and
generative tasks into a single framework. UNITS employs a modified transformer
block to capture universal time series representations, enabling transferability
from a heterogeneous, multi-domain pre-training dataset—characterized by di-
verse dynamic patterns, sampling rates, and temporal scales—to a wide range of
downstream datasets with varied task specifications and data domains. Tested on
38 datasets across human activity sensors, healthcare, engineering, and finance,
UNITS achieves superior performance compared to 12 forecasting models, 20
classification models, 18 anomaly detection models, and 16 imputation models,
including adapted text-based LLMs. UNITS also demonstrates strong few-shot and
prompt capabilities when applied to new domains and tasks. In single-task settings,
UNITS outperforms competitive task-specialized time series models. Code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/mims-harvard/UniTS.

Introduction

Foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have transformed deep learning
by enabling a single pre-trained model to support multiple tasks, eliminating the need for task-
specific models. Language and vision models [9, 101, 92, 50, 32] can be adapted to new tasks
with minimal additional training through approaches such as multi-task learning [125], few-shot
learning [108, 86], and prompting [66]. Beyond language and vision, there is a growing need for
similarly versatile models in time series that can accommodate data from diverse domains—including
medicine [34], engineering [102], and science [48]—and support a wide range of tasks, such as
forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection.

Developing multi-task time series models that unify predictive and generative tasks under a single
framework remains an open challenge. Time series datasets span multiple domains and exhibit varied
temporal scales, sampling rates, and dynamic patterns, making them complex to manage [124, 78].

Existing models often fall short in adaptability, as they either struggle to handle samples with varying
numbers of variables [112, 67, 14] or treat each variable as independent, overlooking important
interdependencies [82]. Time series tasks are also highly diverse, encompassing distinct objectives
and specifications across generative and predictive tasks. For example, generative forecasting tasks
aim to produce future values within a time series, while predictive tasks may involve making discrete
predictions for entire samples. Additionally, task requirements can vary significantly even within the
same task type; for instance, generative tasks may involve different forecast lengths, and predictive
tasks may feature multiple classification categories. As a result, time series models have mainly
remained task-specific, with unique architectures typically designed and trained from scratch for
forecasting [67, 82, 119], classification [30, 113], or other specialized tasks [116, 112]. Recent efforts
to pre-train unified models [36, 22] or adapt LLMs for time series [118, 12, 129, 47, 97, 100] still
heavily depend on extensive fine-tuning or the addition of task- and dataset-specific modules. Some
models have explored generative pre-training transformers specifically for time series forecasting [10,
118, 47, 28], reporting strong results but focusing exclusively on forecasting without addressing
other types of time series tasks. Consequently, these approaches require users to design and train
new modules for each task or limit their application to a single type of tasks. To achieve a versatile,
unified time series model—akin to foundational models in vision and language that operate across
unified task spaces—a model must accommodate both generative and predictive tasks. Such a unified
model would leverage a single set of weights for multiple tasks, removing the need to develop
task-specific models from scratch. This approach would support a broad range of tasks and facilitate
rapid adaptation to new datasets.

model for predictive and generative tasks.

Present work. To address these challenges, we
introduce UNITS, a unified multi-task time se-
ries model capable of handling a broad spec-
trum of time series tasks. We rigorously com-
pare UNITS against 12 forecasting methods,
20 classification methods, 18 anomaly detec-
tion methods, and 16 imputation methods, in-
cluding transformer-based, LLM-based, RNN-
based, and traditional approaches, to highlight
UNITS’s generalizability to new tasks. This ca-
pability is achieved through the following model
design: 1) Task tokenization: UNITS encodes
task specifications into a unified token repre-
sentation, enabling universal task specification
without post-hoc architectural modifications. 2)
Unified time series architecture: UNITS pro-
cesses heterogeneous time series data with vary-
ing numbers of variables and sequence lengths without altering its network structure. To accomplish
this, UNITS employs self-attention across time and variable dimensions to adapt to diverse temporal
dynamics. We introduce a dynamic linear operator to model complex relationships between data
points along the time dimension and a module to reduce interference in the feature space of hetero-
geneous data. 3) Support for generative and predictive tasks: The combination of universal task
specification and a unified time series architecture allows UNITS to share weights across tasks by
co-training on multiple datasets. We use a masked reconstruction pre-training approach, enabling
UNITS to be jointly optimized for generative and predictive tasks.

In the single-task setting, where models are trained individually for each dataset, UNITS outper-
forms task-specialized time series models and repurposed LLMs across forecasting, classification,
anomaly detection, and imputation. In a challenging multi-domain, multi-task setting, we find that a
single shared-weight UNITS model successfully handles 38 tasks, demonstrating its versatility as
a multi-task time series model. UNITS surpasses top baselines that rely on data- and task-specific
modules, achieving the highest average performance across tasks and excelling in 27 out of 38 tasks.
Additionally, UNITS supports prompt-based learning and direct multi-step forecasting with flexible
sequence lengths, capabilities not offered by models using task- and data-specific heads. In direct
multi-step forecasting, UNITS outperforms the strongest baseline (which uses a sliding-window
approach) by 10.5%. UNITS can also adapt to new tasks through parameter-efficient prompting,
achieving results comparable to its fully fine-tuned counterpart. For example, across 20 forecasting
datasets, prompted UNITS slightly outperforms the fully fine-tuned model, reducing MAE from 0.381

to 0.376. Furthermore, UNITS demonstrates effective few-shot transfer, successfully addressing
tasks like imputation, anomaly detection, and out-of-domain forecasting and classification without
requiring specialized modules. For instance, UNITS improves on the strongest baseline by 12.4%
in MSE on imputation and 2.3% in F1-score on anomaly detection. UNITS paves the way toward
unified time series models, offering strong performance and adaptability across tasks and domains.

Related Work

Traditional time series modeling. Time series analysis has been extensively explored in both the
statistics and machine learning communities for many years [45, 103, 123, 18, 80]. Numerous neural
architectures have been developed for specific time series tasks such as forecasting [114, 65, 68,
67, 107], classification [115, 71, 70], anomaly detection [25, 56, 16], and imputation [17, 49, 3].
Task-specific models are typically trained via supervised learning on individual datasets, necessitating
specialized modules. For example, a classification model requires a classification head with a specific
number of classes, while data processing modules must handle a predetermined number of variables.
In contrast, UNITS aims to unify various tasks into a universal task specification, enabling the
handling of diverse data with a single, unified network architecture. This approach facilitates training
a multi-task model capable of addressing multiple time series tasks.
General time series modeling. Foundation models, including language models [9, 101] and vision
models [62, 50], are trained on broad data at scale to address diverse tasks with no or minimal
additional training [8]. Recent studies in time series analysis have sought to develop models with
similar capabilities. This includes developing novel architectures to capture diverse time series
signals. For instance, TimesNet [112] uses multiple frequency-based features obtained through
Fourier transform to capture complex time series signals. There have been several efforts to reprogram
LLMs for time series tasks [81, 12, 129, 47, 10]. Models such as GPT4TS [129] and Time-LLM [47]
adapt LLMs by fine-tuning their embedding layers or aligning time series samples with LLM-based
text prototypes (e.g., GPT-2 [89]). Unlike these models, UNITS is trained exclusively on time series
data rather than relying on LLM architectures. Another approach, Lag-Llama [90], pre-trains a
model on time series data from multiple domains specifically for forecasting tasks. Similarly, the
Moment model [36] is pre-trained on a diverse range of time series data. However, these approaches
still require task-specific modules and tuning for each task. In contrast, our UNITS model supports
generative and predictive tasks without requiring extensive task-specific model adjustments.
Prompt learning. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient method for task adaptation in large
models [55, 88, 121, 13, 42]. Some approaches construct prompts directly in the model’s input
domain, such as text prompts for LLMs [2]. Other methods involve tuning soft token inputs to frozen
language models [58]. In time series, PromptCast [118] and LLMTime [81] convert time series data
into prompts for LLMs to facilitate forecasting. TEMPO [10] is another prompt-based approach
that uses a learned set of prompts for LLM-based forecasting applications, while GPT4MTS [46]
integrates both textual and numerical data to fine-tune LLMs for forecasting. In contrast, UNITS is
trained exclusively on time series data, eliminating the need for computationally expensive pre-trained
LLMs. Moreover, the universal task tokenization enables a frozen UNITS to adapt to new tasks
beyond forecasting, such as classification and imputation. Further discussion of related work can be
found in Appendix A.

Problem Formulation

Notation. We are given a set of multi-domain datasets D = {Di|i = 1, . . . , n}, where each dataset
Di can have a varying number of time series samples; samples can be of varying time lengths and
have varying numbers of sensors/variables. Each dataset is described as Di = (Xi, Yi), where Xi
denotes time series samples and Yi specifies a task defined on Xi. Let X and Y be collections,
defined as X = {Xi|i = 1, . . . , n} and Y = {Yi|i = 1, . . . , n}, respectively. A time series sample
in datasets is denoted as x ∈Rt×v, where t and v are the length of the time series sample and the
number of variables, respectively. We use time dimension and variable dimension to indicate the row
and column dimensions in x. Yi contains four common time series tasks: forecasting, classification,
anomaly detection, and imputation. Further, each task type can be instantiated in numerous ways,
e.g., forecasting over different time lengths and classification with varying numbers of classes. We
use F(X, θ) to denote a multi-task model trained on X. See Table 12 for notation details.

Desiderata for a unified multi-task time series model. Unlike specialized time series models
designed and separately trained for each specific dataset Di, a unified time series model F(X, θ) is
a single model with weights θ that are shared across all types of tasks and satisfies the following
three desiderata: 1) Heterogeneous time series: To process time series from all sources, the model
F must be agnostic with any input samples in X, given the heterogeneity in time series lengths t
and variable counts v in time series samples x from various sources. 2) Universal task specification:
For easy multi-task support and swift adaption to new tasks, the model F should adopt a universal
task specification F(X, θ) →Y applicable across all type of tasks Y. 3) One shared model: Sharing
weights θ across tasks enables the unified model F to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It
contrasts with existing methods that typically train separate models on task-specific datasets, often
involving elaborately tuned training parameters.

To realize the above desiderata, UNITS supports multi-task, prompt-based, and few-shot learning.
Multi-task learning: UNITS specifies a single model F(X, θ) →Y for tasks Y defined on datasets
X. Multi-task learning showcases the flexibility of the model to learn across time series domains
and tasks. Prompt learning: By leveraging prompt tokens, UNITS supports prompt learning,
Prompting{F(X, θ), token} →Y, across tasks while keeping the model frozen. Additionally,
UNITS can be trained in a single-task manner, following the same setup as used by many existing
models. Other settings are described in Appendix C.1.

UNITS Model

UNITS is a multi-task model with a unified network architecture. It uses a token-based format to
describe tasks and time series from different domains. We introduce a novel approach with three
distinct token types: sample, prompt, and task tokens, each serving a unique purpose in time series
analysis. The input time series sample is tokenized into sample tokens. Prompt tokens provide
essential context for the task, guiding the model to accomplish the user-specified task. Task tokens
(GEN and CLS) are combined with other tokens and used for generative and predictive tasks. UNITS
then converts task tokens into task predictions to produce the final model output. Unlike transformers
such as PatchTST [82], UNITS introduces new token types: sample tokens allow for modeling of
multivariate time series, prompt tokens enable efficient multi-task and prompt learning [101], and
task tokens unify predictive and generative tasks into one format.

4.1
Prompting UNITS with Unified Time Series Data Tokens

We introduce how to use unified tokens to unify different task types and data for inference. Tokens
on different network layers have the same shape, so we omit the layer index for simplicity.
Sample tokens. We divide time series input sample x ∈Rt×v into patches along the time dimension
using a non-overlapping patch size of k. A linear layer projects each patch into an embedding vector
of length d, obtaining sample tokens zx ∈Rs×v×d, where s = t/k. Since v and s vary across time

4


---Page Break---
series data domains, we keep the variable and time dimension in tokens. zx are then added with
learnable positional embeddings.
Prompt tokens. Prompt tokens zp ∈Rp×v×d are defined as learnable embeddings, where p is the
number of tokens. In a multi-task setting, each dataset has its own set of prompt tokens. These
tokens incorporate the specific context related to the data and the task the model needs to complete.
For each sample in the dataset, these prompt tokens are appended to the sample tokens and sent to
the network to provide context information about the current sample. For prompt learning, with
the pre-trained model weights being frozen, UNITS adapts to new tasks by utilizing prompt tokens
learned with the prompt tuning. Prompt learning is more efficient than tuning new data/task-specific
heads and achieves comparable performance to full model fine-tuning, as shown by few-shot learning
experiments on new tasks (Tables 4 and 5) and new datasets (Table 3).
Task tokens. In Figure 2ab, we categorize task tokens into two types: 1) GEN (Generation) tokens
used in forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, and 2) CLS (Classification) tokens, which are
used for classification tasks (in a given task, the number of CLS tokens corresponds to the number of
classes in the task). Task tokens define a general format for representing tasks and support flexible
adaptation to new tasks. For tasks involving forecasting, in Figure 2a, the GEN token zm ∈R1×v×d,
is replicated f-times based on desired forecasting length to get ˆzm ∈Rf×v×d. These tokens ˆzm are
then concatenated with the sample and prompt tokens and fed into the UNITS network:

zFore = CA(zp, zx,ˆzm) ∈R(p+s+f)×v×d,
(1)

where CA is the concatenation operation along the time dimension. At the output of the model,
embedding vectors with length d in ˆzm are unpatchified to patches with size e to obtain the forecasting
sample ˆx, i.e. ˆx = Proj(ˆzm) ∈R(f×e)×v. This approach allows the UNITS model to perform direct
multi-step forecasting [99, 76, 119] over arbitrary time lengths, as illustrated in Figure 3. For
classification, in Figure 2b, CLS token zc ∈R1×v×d is concatenated along the time dimension with
the prompt and sample tokens, resulting in:

zPred = CA(zp, zx, zc) ∈R(p+s+1)×v×d,
(2)

which is then fed into the model. We define class embeddings ze ∈Re×v×d for each of e classes in
the task. These class embeddings are either trained or generated by averaging CLS tokens of training
samples in each class. Finally, the class for sample x is predicted by finding the class embedding
vector in ze that is the closest to the CLS token zc from the model output:

Class = argmin
i
||zc −zei||2, i ∈[0, e).
(3)

For imputation, missing values are imputed using the GEN tokens. For anomaly detection, the model
takes a time series sample containing any number of potentially anomalous values, generates the
output sample by reading out the sample tokens, and then determines anomalous values based on the
reconstruction error between the input sample and the generated sample. Details on using tokens for
imputation and anomaly detection are in Appendix C.2. All tokens and embeddings are trained to
achieve their functions.

4.2
Unified Network Architecture in UNITS

Time series samples can have varying numbers of variables, temporal dynamics, and time lengths
across different domains and types of tasks. UNITS uses a modified transformer architecture [104]
to handle heterogeneous multi-domain data with varying dynamics and the number of variables
(Figure 2c). In the following, we describe key modules of UNITS architecture. Note that UNITS can
also be used with other backbones, such as Mamba [38].
Time and variable self-attention. We use a two-way self-attention to both variable and time
dimensions. This approach contrasts with previous methods that apply self-attention to either
time [82] or variable dimension [67], but not to both dimensions. Time and variable self-attention
effectively handle time series samples with various numbers of variables v and different time lengths t.
DyLinear. We modify the transformer block by adding a dynamic operator (DyLinear) into the
feed-forward network layer (FFN). This modification enables the FFN to capture dependencies
between tokens. In contrast to the standard FFN, which processes embedding vectors on a point-wise
basis, DyLinear uses weight interpolation to accommodate varying time lengths. Given a sequence of

5


---Page Break---
sample tokens zt ∈Rlin×d, DyLinear interpolates weights w ∈Rwout×win to accommodate varying
time lengths as follows:

DyLinear(zt, w) = WInterpzt ∈Rlout×d; WInterp = Interp(w) ∈Rlout×lin,
(4)

where Interp is a bi-linear interpolation to resize w from shape wout × win to lout × lin to match the
input and output length. DyLinear captures dependency patterns across time series samples, which
leads to improved performance on generative tasks (Table 23).
Gating module. We add a gating module after each layer to mitigate interference in the latent repre-
sentation space caused by multi-domain and multi-task datasets (Figure 2). This module dynamically
re-scales features in layer-wise latent spaces and promotes the stability of latent representations.
Generative and predictive towers. We design a shared GEN tower (HGEN) and CLS tower (HCLS) for
transferring GEN/CLS tokens to generate time series samples and classification classes, as introduced
in Section 4.1. Unlike existing works that use standalone, task-specific heads for individual datasets,
our approach leverages GEN tower and CLS tower for all generative and predictive tasks, respectively,
ensuring a more unified and efficient model architecture.

The UNITS architecture includes the backbone network composed of N modified transformer
blocks described above, a CLS tower, and a GEN tower. Implementation details are in Appendix C.3.
Ablations in Appendix F verify the effectiveness of this architecture.

4.3
UNITS Model Training

Unified masked reconstruction pre-training. To enhance UNITS’s abilities to 1) learn general
features applicable to both generative and predictive tasks and 2) efficiently adapt to downstream tasks
via prompt learning, we introduce a unified mask reconstruction pre-training scheme. It leverages
the semantics of both prompt and CLS tokens (Section 4.1) for masked reconstruction pre-training,
therefore learning representations for both generative and predictive capabilities. This is distinct
from pre-training strategies that use either generative [82, 120, 26, 54] or predictive [72, 109, 117,
29, 124, 87] approach. Unlike these approaches that pre-train only the model backbone, our strategy
pre-trains all components of UNITS, including the backbone and GEN/CLS towers (Section 4.2),
enabling prompt and zero-shot learning over a frozen pre-trained model. For each time-series sample
x, a handful of sample tokens get masked and replaced with GEN tokens. These masked sample tokens
is then concatenated with prompt tokens and CLS tokens, sent to the UNITS backbone network. In
the unified pre-training loss, tokens from the backbone network output are sent to the CLS/GEN towers
to reconstruct the input sample x, formulating as follows:

Lpretrain = LMSE(HGEN(zp, zx), x) + LMSE( ˆHGEN(HCLS(zPred), zx), x).
(5)

LMSE is the MSE loss to predict the full sample x. For the left side of the loss, prompt token zp
is sent along with sample token zx to GEN tower HGEN to help with the reconstruction. For the
right side of the loss, to leverage the semantics of the CLS token and train the CLS tower HCLS for
predictive tasks, zPred (Eq. 2) from the model output is processed by the CLS tower HCLS to get
classification-related embedding vectors ˆzPred = HCLS(zPred), and another GEN tower ˆHGEN takes in
ˆzPred and zx to predict the full sample. ˆHGEN is only used for pre-training and will be removed for
downstream tasks. This unified pre-training strategy involves pre-training both tokens, the backbone
network, and the GEN/CLS towers for both generative and predictive abilities.
Training UNITS models. We implement and evaluate two UNITS models, each trained in a
different regime. We start with a pre-trained UNITS that is optimized using self-supervised Lpretrain
in Eq. 5 and trained across a collection of multi-domain datasets. Given a self-supervised pre-trained
UNITS whose weights are frozen, we consider a fine-tuned model where only tokens for predictive
or generative tasks are fine-tuned (denoted as UNITS-PMT in Experiments). We also consider a
standard multi-task supervised learning regime, where a single UNITS model is trained from scratch
to simultaneously perform many tasks (denoted as UNITS-SUP in Experiments). These two regimes
use a multi-task setup, where a single model is trained and tested on multiple tasks and datasets.
During multi-task training, we sample batches of time series samples and aggregate dataset-centric
loss values: Ltotal = PI
i=1 λiLi(Di), where Li is the loss of batch i, λi is the weight for each loss,
and I denotes the number of batches. We follow [112] and use the MSE loss for forecasting and
cross-entropy loss for classification. For fair comparison with models trained in a single-task manner,
we follow the experimental setup of [112, 67] and benchmark UNITS in a single-task setting (denoted
as UNITS-ST in Experiments), where the model is trained separately on each dataset/task.

Table 1: Single-task comparison with existing methods on forecasting, classification, anomaly
detection, and imputation tasks where each model is separately trained on each dataset. Full results

Experiments

Datasets. For multi-task learning on forecasting and classification, we compiled 38 datasets from
several sources [79, 33, 82]. These datasets span domains including human activity, healthcare,
mechanical sensors, and finance domains and include 20 forecasting tasks of varying forecast lengths
ranging from 60 to 720, as well as 18 classification tasks featuring from 2 to 52 categories. Time series
samples have varying numbers of readouts (from 24 to 1,152) and sensors (from 1 to 963). Details are
in Table 7. When evaluating multi-task few-shot learning on new datasets, a novel dataset collection
comprising 6 classification tasks and 9 forecasting tasks (Table 8) is utilized. For multi-task few-shot
learning on new tasks, we use the 6 datasets (Table 10) for imputation tasks and 5 datasets (Table 11)
for anomaly detection tasks. On the single-task setting, we following existing works [112, 67] to
use 36 datasets for forecasting (Table 30), 10 datasets for classification (Table 31), 4 datasets for
imputation (Table 10), and 5 datasets for anomaly detection (Table 11).
Baselines. We conduct an extensive comparison between UNITS and 12 time series forecasting
methods, 20 classification methods, 18 anomaly detection methods, and 16 imputation methods, as
listed in Table 13. For comparison on the challenging multi-task setting, we excluded methods that
overly rely on task-specific modules and lack a shared backbone, and we select 6 strong time series
methods: iTransformer [67], TimesNet [82], PatchTST [82], Pyraformer [65], Autoformer [114], and
the LLM-reprogrammed method GPT4TS [129]. Many of these methods are designed and evaluated
only for one type of tasks, e.g., GPT4TS and iTransformer are forecasting models. To include these
methods in our benchmarking, when necessary, we add task-specific input/output modules to support
multiple tasks. Training and evaluation details are shown in Appendix D.2.

Benchmarking UNITS on Single-Task Learning

Setup. For fair comparisons with baseline methods, we benchmark single-task UNITS-ST on
forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Models are separately trained from

Table 2: Multi-task benchmarking across 20 forecasting tasks and 18 classification tasks. Both
UNITS-SUP and UNITS-PMT process all 38 tasks using a single model. GPT4TS reprograms a
pre-trained LLM (GPT-2) to time series and has dataset/task-specific modules, thus, it is excluded
from best count evaluations to ensure fair comparisons.

“P ” is forecasting length. “Class./Num.” denotes the “number of classes in each task”/“number of
datasets”.

Results. Table 1 shows the single-task performance for four types of tasks. On forecasting tasks with
forecasting lengths of 92, 196, 336, and 720, compared with 11 forecasting methods, UNITS-ST
achieves the best results on 32 out of 36 datasets for MSE and 27 out of 36 for MAE, surpassing the
previous best method, iTransformer, by a clear margin. In Table 34, we demonstrate that UNITS-
ST outperforms the concurrent MOMENT [36] model, which was trained on a large and diverse
collection of time series data. Additionally, UNITS-ST achieves stronger performance than LLM-
reprogrammed methods that are pre-trained with extensive natural language data, e.g. GPT4TS [129],
TEST [97], LLM4TS [12], and TEMPO [10]. On 10 classification datasets, UNITS-ST outperforms
19 classification methods on the average accuracy, such as the transformer/MLP/frequency-based
methods. It has a gain of 1.4% compared to the previous best TimesNet model. On 5 anomaly
detection datasets, UNITS-ST has a clear gain of 3.95% in F1 score compared to the TimesNet
and also beat other 15 anomaly detection methods, such as Anomaly Transformer [116]. On 16
imputation datasets with a mask ratio of 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, UNITS-ST has the best results on all
datasets in terms of MSE and MAE, outperforming 14 baseline methods. UNITS-ST has the SoTA
performance on these single-task benchmarks, showing its effectiveness.

5.2
Benchmarking UNITS for Multi-Task Learning

Setup. In a multi-task setting, we benchmark a single UNITS model co-trained and evaluated on 38
datasets, comprising 20 forecasting tasks and 18 classification tasks, with variations in the number
of variables/sensors, classification classes, and forecasting lengths. We consider two variants of
UNITS; the fully supervised UNITS-SUP and the more challenging UNITS-PMT with prompting, as
introduced in Section 4.3. Baselines use the same fully supervised multi-task training as our approach
but cannot handle differences across data types and task specifications with a single model. To
benchmark them, a shared backbone is used for all tasks, augmented by data-specific input modules
and task-specific output modules.
Results: Model benchmarking. Table 2 shows multi-task learning performance. UNITS consistently
outperforms baseline methods, achieving the best results in 17 out of 20 forecasting tasks (MSE) and
10 out of 18 classification tasks (accuracy). Performance gains are especially remarkable because
UNITS has one fully shared model, whereas all existing methods require task or dataset-specific
modules. We find that baseline methods encounter difficulties performing well across different types
of tasks. For example, TimesNet, which excels in classification tasks, underperforms in forecasting
tasks. Conversely, iTransformer, the top-performing forecaster, struggles with classification tasks. In
contrast, the UNITS model exhibits robust performance across classification and forecasting. On
forecasting, UNITS-SUP surpasses the leading baseline, iTransformer, by 5.8% (0.439 vs. 0.466)
in MSE and 3.3% (0.381 vs. 0.394) in MAE. On classification, UNITS-SUP has an average gain of
0.7% accuracy (81.6% vs. 80.9%) over the strongest baseline (TimesNet). UNITS shows promising
potential to unify data and task diversity across time series domains.

Recent research has adapted pre-trained LLMs to time series [47, 12, 129, 37]. Most approaches
[47, 12, 129], such as GPT4TS, incorporate additional task-specific modules to align the modalities
of time series and natural language. We compare UNITS with GPT4TS that reprograms pre-trained
GPT-2 model [89]. Despite the substantial data amount and model scale gap, e.g., GPT4TS is 48×
larger than UNITS-SUP (164.5M vs. 3.4M), UNITS-SUP still compares favorably to GPT4TS. On
forecasting tasks, UNITS-SUP even outperforms GPT4TS by 2.2% (0.439 vs. 0.449; MSE).
Results: Prompting is competitive with supervised training. Using tokens to prompt a frozen
UNITS, the SSL-pre-trained UNITS achieves performance comparable to its fully supervised counter-
part (Table 2). UNITS-PMT even outperforms the supervised model in forecasting, with a lower MAE
score (0.379 vs. 0.381), highlighting the effectiveness of prompt learning in UNITS. Furthermore,
prompt learning with UNITS surpasses the performance of supervised baseline methods with separate
modules. This indicates that the SSL-pre-trained model captures valuable time series representations
and that prompt learning allows the model to efficiently adapt to target tasks.

5.3
UNITS for Direct Multi-Step Forecasting

Setup. Direct multi-step forecasting predicts across varying time horizons by adjusting from the
original trained length, with offsets ranging from 0 to 384. We use 14 out of 20 forecasting datasets
with varying lengths. UNITS achieves this flexibility by repeating the GEN token, as described
in Section 4.1, a capability not supported by existing methods. For comparison with baseline models,
we implement a sliding-window approach for forecasting. In this method, predictions are made over
a fixed window size, which then shifts forward incrementally to cover progressively extended time
horizons. This sliding mechanism allows us to adapt the model to forecast over new, unseen time
periods while maintaining consistency with the evaluation setup used by baseline methods.
Results: Direct multi-step inference outperforms sliding window approach. In Figure 3, UNITS
demonstrates improved performance over baseline models across various forecasting lengths when
using the sliding-window approach. For example, in the longest forecasting extension of +384,
UNITS outperforms the iTransformer by 8.7% in MSE, achieving a score of 0.451 compared to
0.494. When using direct multi-step inference, UNITS gains an even larger advantage over the
iTransformer, reducing MSE by 10.5% (0.442 vs. 0.494). This approach also reduces the average
number of inference steps from 3.66 to 1, resulting in a 3× speedup.

5.4
UNITS for Few-Shot Learning on New Datasets and Tasks

For transfer learning on new tasks and datasets, we load the model weights pre-trained on 38 datasets
and apply them in a multi-task setting. We evaluate two approaches: the fully fine-tuned UNITS-FT
model and the prompted UNITS-PMT model, in which task-specific tokens are trained.
Setup: Few-shot classification and forecasting. Pre-trained models, undergo fine-tuning using 5%,
15%, and 20% of the 11 training set shown in Table 8. Average performance is reported.
Results. UNITS achieves superior performance compared to iTransformer across all training data
ratios (Table 3). At the 20% data ratio, UNITS-FT achieves a gain of 8.8% in classification accuracy
and a reduction of 5.7% in forecasting MSE. UNITS-PMT surpasses the fully supervised iTrans-

former, leading to 6.2% increase in classification accuracy and 3.1% decrease in forecasting MSE.
When trained under a 5% data ratio,UNITS-PMT exceeds UNITS-FT performance for forecasting,
suggesting that prompt learning is effective for transfer learning when training data is scarce.
Setup: Few-shot imputation. Models are fine-tuned with 10% of 6 imputation training data listed
in Table 10, asked to impute 25% and 50% of missing data points.
Results. A unified UNITS-FT outperforms models that use separate task-specific modules (Table 4),
indicating that UNITS has robust few-shot imputation performance. Specifically, on a 25% masking
ratio, UNITS-FT exceeds the top-performing baseline iTransformer by 12.4% in MSE and 7.9% in
MAE. The margin remains notable at a 50% masking ratio, where UNITS-FT surpasses iTransformer
by 8.8% in MSE and 6.8% in MAE. UNITS-PMT, the fixed model with appropriate prompt tokens,
outperforms all baseline methods and achieves results comparable to its fully fine-tuned counterpart,
suggesting that prompting can adapt UNITS for imputation.
Setup: Few-shot anomaly detection. The pre-trained models have been fine-tuned using 5% of five
training datasets as listed in Table 10. The average F1-score is used as the metric.
Results. UNITS outperforms the top-performing baseline (PathTST) across all metrics (Table 5).
UNITS-FT achieves an F1-score of 86.3 compared to PathTST’s F1-score of 84.3. UNITS-PMT also
outperforms specialized models (Anomaly Transformer) trained from scratch.
Additional results and ablations. Zero-shot learning is significantly more challenging than few-shot
learning. Our work primarily focuses on few-shot learning, with some initial exploration of zero-shot
learning for forecasting tasks of UniTS on new datasets in Appendix G. Additional analysis and
ablation results are in Appendix F and Appendix E.

Conclusion

We have developed UNITS, a unified model for time series that uses a universal specification of
time series tasks. UNITS handles multi-domain time series data with heterogeneous representations,
outperforming task-specific models and reprogrammed LLMs on 38 multi-domain and multi-task
datasets. UNITS also shows strong few-shot and prompt-based performance and can generalize
to new domains and tasks. The unified token scheme in UNITS allows it to represent data and
tasks in a general manner. UNITS uses a transformer architecture, and we plan to explore other
types of backbones, such MLP-based blocks [107, 14] and Mamba [38], to further enhance UNITS.
Limitations and future directions are discussed in Appendix M.

Extended Related Work

Comparison of the abilities required by a unified time series model. We evaluate whether existing
works in time series possess the necessary capabilities for constructing a unified time series model,
as outlined in Table 6. Most methods fail to support these requirements. For instance, PatchTST
[82] processes each variable independently, enabling it to handle multi-domain time series datasets
without the need for data-specific heads. However, it still requires task-specific heads for tasks like
making forecasts over a fixed length or performing classifications within a predetermined number of
classes.

Table 6: Key features of a unified multi-task time series model include the capability to handle
heterogeneous time series samples with different numbers of variables and time lengths. Additionally,
it should support both generative and predictive time series tasks within the same model.

Datasets

Dataset details. We introduce the details of the multi-task dataset collection used by our work
in Table 7. The dataset collection used for few-shot learning on classification and forecasting are
listed in Table 8, the collection used for zero-shot forecasting are listed in Table 9, the collection used
for imputation is listed in Table 10, and the collection used for anomaly detection is listed in Table 11.
Datasets were aggregated from the Monash Forecasting Repository [33], Time Series Classification
Website [79], and Time Series Library [112]. The combined training set consists of over 35 million
timesteps and over 6,000 variables. For subsets of a dataset such as ETTh1, we start by splitting
the data into training and testing sets based on distinct time intervals of a long time series sequence,
following splits in [112]. Within these training and testing intervals, we generate samples using
various sliding windows, ensuring that there is no data leakage between the training and testing sets.
Dataset for direct multi-step forecasting on new forecasting lengths. For evaluating zero-shot
learning capabilities over new forecasting lengths, we initially consider 20 forecasting datasets utilized
in the multi-task setting, as detailed in Table 7. However, to adapt to 384 additional forecasting
lengths that the model was not trained on, we exclude specific datasets that are incompatible with
this requirement. These datasets include NN5P 112, ECLP 720, ETTh1P 720, ILIP 60, TrafficP 720, and
WeatherP 720. Consequently, our analysis is conducted using 14 remaining forecasting datasets.

All learning settings supported by UNITS

UNITS incorporates multi-task, prompt, few-shot, and zero-shot learning, as well as the single-task
learning same to existing methods. We introduce the multi-task and prompt learning in the manuscript,
here we introduce the other settings supported by UNITS.

Notations for zero-shot/few-shot learning. ˆ
X is an out-of-domain dataset collection not included in
X, and ˆY is used to denote a new type of tasks not contained in Y.
Zero-shot learning. UNITS has zero-shot learning ability where model F(X, θ) trained on all
datasets in D is tested on multiple types of new tasks that are not trained for, i.e. F(X, θ) →
ˆ
X, ˆ
X /∈X. New zero-shot learning tasks include direct multi-step forecasting with a new length and
forecasting on out-of-domain datasets with a new number of variables. Zero-shot learning shows the
adaptability of UNITS to different time series tasks.

Few-shot learning. UNITS model F(X, θ) pre-trained on X, can be fine-tuned on a few samples on
new data ˆ
X and new tasks ˆY, i.e., Few-Shot{F(X, θ), ˆ
X} = F( ˆ
X, ˆθ) →ˆY. We verify the few-shot
learning ability of UNITS on forecasting and classification tasks on new, out-of-domain datasets and
on new types of tasks, including imputation and anomaly detection.
Single-task learning. UNITS model can also conduct the single-task learning same as the existing
works, where each model is separately trained on each dataset Di = (Xi, Yi), i.e., F(Xi, θi) →Yi.

Generalizing Task Tokens to Various Tasks

We introduce how to use tokens for forecasting and classification tasks in the manuscript. Here we
present the implementation of using tokens for imputation and anomaly detection tasks.
Imputation task. In tasks that require imputation, GEN token zm is inserted in the positions where
sample tokens zx are missing. This process creates an augmented sequence of tokens represented by
ˆzx. These augmented tokens are then concatenated along the time dimension with prompt tokens,
forming the input tokens for the network:

zImp = CA(zp,ˆzx) ∈R(p+s)×v×d,

where CA denotes the concatenation operation along the time dimension. Similar to the approach in
forecasting tasks, the output for augmented sample tokens ˆzx are unpatchified to obtain the imputed
sample ˆx, i.e. ˆx = Proj(ˆzx).
Anomaly detection task. For the anomaly detection task, we follow TimesNet [112] to form it as a
generative task, where the model is trained to reconstruct the time series sample using reconstruction
error as the anomaly criterion. The prompt tokens and the sample tokens are concatenated along the
time dimension to form the input tokens for the network:

zAno = CA(zp, zx) ∈R(p+s)×v×d.

The output for sample tokens zx is unpatchified to obtain the predicted sample ˆx. During inference,
following the approach in [112], we determine a threshold of reconstruction error from the training
and testing data, which is then used to detect anomalous time series points. Specifically, we sort the
reconstruction errors between the input and output samples from our model across all training and
testing sets. A predefined anomaly ratio is then applied to determine the threshold that distinguishes
normal from anomalous data points.

Implementation of UNITS Network Architecture

The UNITS network architecture is composed of N UNITS blocks, one CLS tower, and one GEN
tower. We introduce more implementation details of UNITS network architecture, including the
Time MHSA, Variable MHSA, Dynamic FFN, and Gate Module in the UNITS block, as well as the
GEN/CLS towers shared for generative and predictive tasks.
UNITS block: time and variable MHSA. For attention across the time dimension, the standard
MHSA is applied as done by [82]. For variable MHSA, to capture relations among variables across
all time points while minimizing the computational overhead associated with long time lengths, we
average the Q and K over the time dimension to get shared ˆQ and ˆK as follows:

ˆQ, ˆK = meant(Q, K); Q, K, V = Linear(zin),
(8)

where meant is the mean along the time dimension. Then, Output = AttnvV = Softmax

is obtained where Attnv ∈Rv×v is the attention map among variables, which is shared for all time
points. The notations for multi-head attention are omitted for simplicity. We show the effectiveness
of both time and variable MHSA in Table 22.

UNITS block: Dynamic FFN. By argument the FFN layer in transformers with the proposed
DyLinear operator, we present the Dynamic FFN module, as shown in Figure 5. In the Dy-
namic FFN, we replace the first linear layer in the standard FFN layer with a 3-kernel convo-
lution across the time dimension to capture the local details. The second linear layer is kept
the same as the standard FFN layer, and the DyLinear is inserted in between the input convo-
lution and the output linear layer.
Specifically, after processed by the convolution layer, the
embeddings with d dimension are split into two groups, resulting in (z1
mid, z2
mid) ∈Rs×v×d/2.

z1

(9)

where DyLinearM processes the sample and prompt tokens in z1
mid with
two DyLinear operators, while CLS token is skipped to ensure consistency
for all tasks. z2
mid is kept unprocessed. This separation of routes for
z1
mid and z2
mid leads to a scale combination effect, enhancing multi-scale
processing ability [31].
UNITS block: gate module. The gate module is placed as the output
of each component in the UNITS block, including time MHSA, variable
MHSA, and Dynamic FFN. Specifically, given an input zin ∈Rs×v×d, a
linear layer maps it to a scaling factor xg ∈Rs×v×1 along the embedding
dimension. This is followed by a Sigmoid function to ensure the scaling
factor lies between 0 and 1. The final gating operation involves element-
wise multiplication of the input by the Sigmoid-activated scaling factor,
i.e.,
zout = Sigmoid(xg) · zin, xg = Linear(zin).
(10)

GEN tower. The GEN tower HGEN is designed to transform tokens into
time points prediction results. One GEN tower is shared by all generative
tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. As shown in Figure 4, take the
forecasting task as an example, the zFore ∈R(p+s+f)×v×d from Eq. 1 is processed by the GEN tower
to get the full time-series sample as follows:

ˆx = Proj(MLP((zFore + DyLinear(zFore))),
(11)

where the MLP is composed of two linear layers with an activation layer in between, and Proj is
the unpatchify operation that transfers the embedding back to the time series patch as introduced
in Section 4.1. For imputation and anomaly detection tasks, only the tokens are modified while the
GEN tower remains unchanged.
CLS tower. The CLS tower HCLS transforms CLS tokens into classification classes. The CLS tower is
shared across all classification tasks from different datasets. As illustrated in Figure 4, the CLS tower
processes zPred ∈R(p+s+1)×v×d from Eq. 2, which includes the CLS token z
′
c, to produce the final
CLS token zc as follows:

zc = z
′′
c + MLP(z
′′
c ),
z
′′
c = z
′
c + CrossAtt(Query = z

(12)

where the CLS token z
′
c serves as a query to perform cross-attention with all tokens in zPred. Subse-
quently, the processed CLS token zc is matched with class embeddings to determine the predicted
class as described in Eq. 3.

Model Details

By default, in a multi-task setting, the UNITS network comprises three UNITS blocks, one GEN tower,
and one CLS tower. For each data source, the prompt tokens and task tokens are defined. Forecasting
tasks on the same data source but with different forecast lengths share the same prompt and GEN
token. For zero-shot learning on new datasets, we use a shared prompt and GEN token across all data
sources to facilitate zero-shot learning. Tokens are trained to achieve their functions. The number
of embedding dimensions, d, is set to 64 for UNITS-SUP and 128 for UNITS-PMT. All blocks in
UNITS maintain the same feature shape, following the Transformer architecture.

Training Details

For multi-task settings, all models are jointly trained on multiple tasks following the same training
protocol. To match the size of the largest dataset, samples from each dataset are repeated in every
training epoch. In each inference step, datasets are randomly sampled with equal probability, utilizing
a batch size of 32. Supervised training involves 5 epochs using gradient accumulation for an effective
batch size of 1024, starting with a learning rate of 3.2e-2 and adjusted with a multi-step decayed
schedule. The λi in Ltotal are all set to 1 in this work. For self-supervised pre-training, the models are
trained over 10 epochs with an effective batch size of 4096 and an initial learning rate of 6.4e-3, using
a cosine decay schedule. All experiments are conducted using A100-40G GPUs. Each experiment is
conducted with one or two GPUs, and the maximum running time is under 48 hours.

Since all models are jointly trained across multiple tasks, we report the average performance for each
task type. For tasks involving forecasting and imputation, model performance is assessed using Mean
Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In classification tasks, accuracy is used as
the primary evaluation metric. For anomaly detection tasks, performance is measured using precision,
recall, and the F1-score.
No task-specific hyper-parameter tuning. UNITS is designed for multi-task settings where tasks
share the same model weights. In UNITS, we do not need to perform any task-specific hyper-
parameter tuning. The baseline methods follow the same training setting as our method to ensure a
fair comparisons.

D.3
Further Information on Pre-training

During the unified pre-training, we introduce two distinct masking schemes: the random masking
scheme and the right masking scheme. The time series sample is initially truncated to a length
randomly selected within the range of 50% to 100% of its original length. Subsequently, in the
random masking scheme, a certain proportion prand of tokens are masked at random positions within
the time dimension. For the right masking scheme, designed to enhance the model’s forecasting
ability, a random proportion pright of tokens on the right side of the sample is masked. Both prand and
pright are set to 70%-80%. Each training step randomly utilizes one of these two schemes with equal
probability.

D.4
Implementation Details of Baselines

The baseline methods used in this paper are summarized in Table 13. Unlike UniTS, which can handle
diverse data and tasks within a single model, baseline methods cannot be directly used for unified
training because: 1) To accommodate data with varying numbers of variables, baseline methods
typically use a data-specific input head to project features from the variable count to a fixed number
of embedding dimensions. 2) Similarly, to manage different tasks, such as classification with various
classes and forecasting with different lengths, baseline methods employ task-specific output heads
to transform the features into the appropriate task outputs. Since baseline methods are designed for
single-task training, in their original setting, data/task-specific heads are used for each data and task.
In the multi-task learning setting, to make baseline methods support unified training, we add separate
input heads to project data into a shared embedding space and separate output heads to convert the
shared model output into task-specific outputs. However, using separate input and output heads
makes it hard to generalize to new datasets and tasks. We employ the same fully supervised multi-task
training approach as UniTS. In this setting, model networks are stacked with 3 basic building blocks,
except for GPT4TS, which utilizes the prescribed setting of 6 GPT blocks. For both the proposed
method and patch-based baseline approaches, the patch size and stride are fixed at 16. The input
and output heads of baseline methods are duplicated for each task to create data/task-specific heads
tailored for each data source and task. For single-task learning settings, we follow the original settings
of baseline methods and compare results reported in their papers.

Additional Results: Prompt Learning and Pre-training

We do more analysis on the prompting and pre-training of UNITS. The average performance under
38 datasets with the multi-task setting is reported.
Prompt learning with model scaling. In Table 14, we further explore the capabilities of prompt
learning in the SSL pre-trained UNITS model across different model sizes. As UNITS model size
grows, we observe consistent improvements in performance for both classification and forecasting,
suggesting that larger SSL models contain more robust representations for prompt learning.

Effect of prompt tokens. Prompt tokens learn the contextual information related to the given data
source and task types. By default, we use 10 prompt tokens for each task. We present an ablation

25


---Page Break---
study on the use of different numbers of prompt tokens in Table 15. Utilizing prompt tokens leads to
notable improvements in both forecasting and classification tasks. The average classification accuracy
improves from 81.0% to 81.6%, and the average MSE and MAE improve from 0.460 to 0.439 and
0.391 to 0.381, respectively. Employing 10 instead of 5 prompt tokens results in greater gains in
forecasting tasks and a marginal improvement of 0.1% in classification accuracy, indicating that
forecasting tasks benefit more from the contextual information provided by the prompt tokens. We
also evaluate the case where all prompt tokens are shared among tasks in Table 16. Using shared
prompt tokens across different tasks results in a performance decline, yet this approach still surpasses
the performance of models that do not utilize prompt tokens.

Unified pre-training. In Equation 5, the proposed unified mask reconstruction pre-training loss is
detailed, consisting of two components: the mask reconstruction loss associated with prompt tokens
and the mask reconstruction loss related to CLS tokens. Table 17 presents the results where either the
CLS token-based reconstruction loss or the prompt token-based reconstruction loss is omitted. The
performance of prompt learning is reported. The results highlight the impact of each loss component
on the learning performance.

Specifically, excluding the CLS token-based loss resulted in a significant decline in classification
performance, dropping sharply from 78.0% to 33.1%. This substantial drop underscores the critical
role of the CLS token-based pre-training loss in enabling the model’s classification capabilities. Con-
versely, the removal of the prompt token-based loss adversely affected the forecasting performance.
For instance, the MSE drops from 0.471 to 0.967. This deterioration in performance demonstrates
the importance of prompt token-based pre-training in generative tasks.
Pre-training with scaled numbers of epochs and data sizes. To evaluate the effect of scaling effect
of pre-training, we conduct experiments of pre-training UniTS by varying the size of the pre-training
dataset and the amount of training epochs. As demonstrated in Table 18, increasing the number of
pre-training epochs improves performance on both forecasting and classification tasks. Similarly,
increasing the size of pre-training dataset improves performance on both forecasting and classification
tasks, as shown in Table 19.

Cross-task pre-training. We evaluate the effect of cross-task pre-training by pre-training a model us-
ing our pre-training strategy on either generative tasks (forecasting) or predictive tasks (classification).
Table 20 shows that UniTS, pre-trained solely on forecasting datasets, achieves similar performance
to the model pre-trained on both forecasting and classification data. Despite not encountering any

26


---Page Break---
classification datasets during pre-training, it still performs well on classification tasks. When the
model is pre-trained exclusively on classification datasets, performance on both classification and
forecasting tasks drops significantly compared to the model pre-trained on both types of data. Given
that the data amount of forecasting datasets is larger than classification datasets (22920 vs. 5022 iter-
ations per epoch), this suggests that the larger amount of data plays a more crucial role in pre-training
effectiveness than the data type.

Cross-domain pre-training. We evaluate the effect of cross-domain data pre-training, where the
model is pre-trained on either Weather-domain datasets or Traffic-domain datasets. In Table 21,
compared to joint pre-training on both domains, the performance decreases with single-domain
pre-training, where pre-training is conducted solely on the downstream dataset’s domain, showing the
advantage of joint pre-training. For instance, the MSE on Weather datasets goes from 0.253 to 0.259.
Compared to single-domain pre-training, cross-domain pre-training leads to larger performance
drops, e.g., pre-training on Traffic datasets and then evaluating on Weather datasets results in an
MSE increase from 0.259 to 0.289. Interestingly, pre-training on Weather datasets achieves better
performance across both domains, suggesting that data from certain domains might be more beneficial
for pre-training.

Effect of time and variable MHSA. In Table 22, we present an ablation study to assess the impact
of both Time and Variable MHSA on the UNITS model. When the Time MHSA is removed from the
UNITS model, we observe a decrease in performance, where the average accuracy drops to 80.7%,
and the MSE drops to 0.449. Similarly, eliminating the Variable MHSA from the UNITS model
results in diminished performance. This scenario yields a decreased accuracy of 80.8%, a decrease in
MSE to 0.444, and a reduction in MAE to 0.383. These experimental findings highlight the crucial
role that both Time and Variable MHSA play in the efficacy of the UNITS model.
Effect of Dynamic FFN. In Table 23, we present an ablation study on the Dynamic FFN layer in
the UNITS network. The UNITS, which incorporates the Dynamic FFN, achieves the highest per-

MLP layer exhibits a decrease in performance. The average accuracy dropped to 81.3%, and MSE
and MAE dropped to 0.462 and 0.394, respectively. This variation suggests the effect of Dynamic
FFN for the UNITS. The performance is observed when the Dynamic FFN is completely removed
from the model, highlighting the importance of Dynamic FFN layers in UNITS network.

the inclusion of the gate module. Incorporating the gate module yields consistent enhancements
relative to the baseline model that lacks it. Specifically, the addition of the gate module results in an
increase in classification accuracy, moving from 81.1% to 81.6%. For the forecasting task, the MSE
sees an improvement from 0.459 to 0.439, and the MAE decreases from 0.387 to 0.381. These results
show the effectiveness of the gate module in mitigating task interference by adjusting the scaling of
embedding vectors.

Comparison with Transformer. To verify the effectiveness of UNITS structure, we compare the
original Transformer with UNITS. The unified tokenization and co-training strategy are applied to
both models. The results shown in Table 26 indicate that UNITS clearly outperforms the Transformer
in both classification and forecasting tasks, suggesting that merely using a transformer structure is
insufficient for achieving robust multi-task performance on time series datasets.

Additional Results: UNITS for Zero-Shot Forecasting on New Datasets

Setup. When UNITS is trained with shared prompt and GEN tokens across all forecasting tasks,
it acquires the ability to perform zero-shot forecasting on datasets with new lengths and variable
numbers that were not part of its training domain. We evaluate UNITS in a zero-shot setting on five
new forecasting tasks as referenced in Table 9. These tasks have varying forecasting lengths and
numbers of variables compared to those seen by UNITS during pre-training. We benchmark against
LLMTime [81], a model designed for zero-shot forecasting using LLMs. Following LLMTime, we
utilize one sample from each dataset to manage the extensive inference costs. We exclude a related
method, Time-LLM [47], from experiments. Time-LLM supports zero-shot learning but requires that
the forecasting length and the number of variables/sensors for zero-shot prediction are the same as
those used for training.

Results. UNITS considerably surpasses LLMTime across most of the tested datasets, demonstrating
superior performance in handling different forecasting lengths and variable numbers (Table 25). For
example, UNITS achieves a 45.2% improvement in MSE over LLMTime (0.456 vs. 0.832) on River.
Remarkably, UNITS exhibits an inference speed approximately 106 times faster than LLMTime.

Additional Results: Relation among Prompt Tokens

We calculate the similarity between prompt tokens across datasets, as illustrated in Figure 7. Datasets
within the same class, for instance, FaceDetection and SelfRegulationSCP2, which both consist of
EEG data, demonstrate a higher similarity. While some out-of-domain datasets still exhibit strong
similarities, indicating that they share certain similar requirements.

To compare the difference among tokens before and after training, beyond similarity comparison,
we show UMAP plots generated with the prompt tokens before and after training, in Figure 8 and
Figure 9. Before training, the prompt tokens from all datasets are dispersed. In contrast, the UMAP
of prompt tokens after training reveals that tokens from the same datasets are clustered. However,
some tokens from different datasets remain closely positioned, indicating that data from different
domains share similar information.

Additional Results: Direct Multi-step Forecasting on New Forecasting
Lengths

Average inference steps comparison. In Table 6, we present a comparison of the average number
of inference steps required by our direct multi-step inference method and the multi-step sliding
window-based inference approach. Contrary to the direct multi-step inference, which is completed in
a single step, the sliding window-based method necessitates multiple inference steps. Specifically,
for the maximum extra inference length of 384, the sliding window-based approach demands, on
average, 3.66 times more inference steps.

Additional Results: Benchmarking in the Single-Task Regime

Setup. As we are the first work that focuses on time series multi-task learning with one model, to make
fair comparisons with existing time series methods, we compare them with the single-task setting.
In this setting, for each dataset, one model is independently trained with tuned hyperparameters.
Following existing works [112, 67, 14], we tune the following hyperparameters, including number of
channels, patch size, number of layers, learning rate, and dropout ratio. The baseline methods for
time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation, are listed in Table 13. We
following existing works [112, 67] to use 36 commonly used datasets for forecasting (Table 30), 10

datasets for classification(Table 31), 4 datasets for imputation (Table 10), and 5 datasets for anomaly
detection (Table 11).
Forecasting. We compare the forecasting performance with the forecasting length of 96, 192, 336,
and 720. To make fair comparisons with baseline methods under different look back windows, we
have forecasting results in both fixed and optimal back windows. The full results for forecasting
with a 96 look back window are shown in Table 30. The full results with optimal look back window
ranging from 96 to 512 are shown Table 34.
Classification. Following [112], we use 10 multivariate datasets from the UEA dataset collection [4].
The full results for classification are shown in Table 31.
Imputation. Imputation aims to fill in the missing data points of the time series samples. We
randomly mask data points of the time series samples with mask ratios of 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, and
50%, and then make the model predict the missing points. The full results of the imputation task are
shown in Table 33.
Anomaly detection. Anomaly detection identifies the anomalous data points in the time series
samples. We present the complete results of anomaly detection in Table 32.

Additional Results: Multi-task versus Single-task Learning

To verify the gap between multi-task and single-task learning under fair comparisons, we conduct
a experiment to train the single-task models using the same hyper-parameters as the multi-task co-
training. As shown in Table 35, multi-task learning achieves stronger performance on both forecasting
and classification tasks. Interestingly, under the same hyper-parameters, some classification models
fail to converge in the single-task setting, whereas the multi-task model does not have this issue,
demonstrating the robustness of multi-task training.

---Page Break---
Table 34: Full results of the long-term forecasting task where model is separately trained on each
dataset. The input time series sequence length is set ranging from 96 to 512 to ensure fair comparisons.
Baseline results are obtained from their original papers. "Extra Training Data" indicates whether
the model uses training data beyond just time series data. "Multi-task Support" refers to whether
the model can handle multiple tasks or is focused solely on a single task. Gray color represents
LLM-reprogrammed models that reprogram pre-trained LLMs to time series domain and needs
dataset/task-specific modules. For the best count, we only consider the purely time series models.

Limitations and Future Directions

The datasets collected by this work do not yet cover all available time series datasets, such as some of
the univariate datasets in UCR dataset collections [23] and the more physiologic time series signals
from PhysioNet [34]. We will explore using larger dataset collections to further improve UNITS.

UNITS primarily aims to unify predictive and generative tasks within a single multi-task model. We
demonstrate this by showcasing its adaptability to new data and tasks through prompt learning and
few-shot learning. While adapting to new time series data differs fundamentally from generalizing to
entirely new data, we will further explore UNITS’s generalization ability for zero-shot learning.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction cover the contributions and scope of the paper
regarding building a unified time-series model.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Section M, we discuss the limitations and future work regarding the size of
dataset collections and the exploration of more advanced network architectures.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

37


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implementation details for experiment settings in Sec-
tion 5, Section D, and Section K. We also provide the source code and datasets at
https://github.com/mims-harvard/UniTS.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

38


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
We provide the source code and datasets at https://github.com/
mims-harvard/UniTS. Instructions for downloading data and running experiments are
provided inside."
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the details for training and test settings in Section 5, Section D,
and Section K. Full details are shown in the provided code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use a fixed seed in experiments to maintain low statistical variance.
Additionally, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets to ensure the statistical significance
of the results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

39


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the computer resources we used in Section D.2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and adhere to it.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the broader impacts in Section N.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

40


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use open source datasets and codes based on their licenses. Most baselines
are released under mit lisxxx. We use opsource datasets preprocessed xxx we did not crxx
build new dataset in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

41


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

42


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
