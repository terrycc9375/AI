Abstract

Recent text-based causal methods attempt to mitigate confounding bias by esti-
mating proxies of confounding variables that are partially or imperfectly measured
from unstructured text data. These approaches, however, assume analysts have su-
pervised labels of the confounders given text for a subset of instances, a constraint
that is sometimes infeasible due to data privacy or annotation costs. In this work,
we address settings in which an important confounding variable is completely
unobserved. We propose a new causal inference method that uses two instances
of pre-treatment text data, infers two proxies using two zero-shot models on the
separate instances, and applies these proxies in the proximal g-formula. We prove,
under certain assumptions about the instances of text and accuracy of the zero-shot
predictions, that our method of inferring text-based proxies satisfies identification
conditions of the proximal g-formula while other seemingly reasonable proposals
do not. To address untestable assumptions associated with our method and the
proximal g-formula, we further propose an odds ratio falsification heuristic that
flags when to proceed with downstream effect estimation using the inferred proxies.
We evaluate our method in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings—the latter with
real-world clinical notes from MIMIC-III and open large language models for zero-
shot prediction—and find that our method produces estimates with low bias. We
believe that this text-based design of proxies allows for the use of proximal causal
inference in a wider range of scenarios, particularly those for which obtaining
suitable proxies from structured data is difficult.

Introduction

Data-driven decision making relies on estimating the effect of interventions, i.e. causal effect estima-
tion. For example, a doctor must decide which medicine she will give her patient, ideally the one with
the greatest effect on positive outcomes. Many causal effects are estimated via randomized controlled
trials—considered the gold standard in causal inference; however, if an experiment is unfeasible or
unethical, one must use observational data. In observational settings, a primary obstacle to unbiased
causal effect estimation is confounding variables, variables that affect both the treatment (e.g., which
medicine) and the outcome.

Recently, some studies have attempted to mitigate confounding by incorporating (pre-treatment)
unstructured text data as proxies for confounding variables or by specifying confounding variables as
linguistic properties, e.g., topic (Veitch et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020), tone (Sridhar and Getoor,
2019), or use of specific word types (Olteanu et al., 2017). A wide range of fields have used text in

we use the proximal g-formula implied by the casual DAG to estimate the causal effect.

causal estimates, including medicine (Zeng et al., 2022), the behavioral social sciences (Kiciman
et al., 2018), and science-of-science (Zhang et al., 2023). See Keith et al. (2020); Feder et al. (2022);
Egami et al. (2022) for general overviews of text-based causal estimation.

If all confounders are directly observed, then causal estimation is relatively1 straightforward with
backdoor adjustment (Pearl, 2009). However, known confounders are often unobserved. In such
scenarios, researchers typically use supervised classifiers to predict the confounding variables from
text data, but these text classifiers rarely achieve perfect accuracy and measurement error must be
accounted for. To address this, another line of work has developed post-hoc corrections of causal
estimates in the presence of noisy classifiers (Wood-Doughty et al., 2018; Fong and Tyler, 2021;
Egami et al., 2023; Mozer et al., 2023). These approaches, however, require ground-truth labels of
the confounding variables for a subset of instances, a constraint that is not always feasible due to
privacy restrictions, high annotation costs, or lack of expert labor for labeling.

Our work fills this gap. We address the causal estimation setting for which a practitioner has specified
a confounding variable that is truly unmeasured (we have no observations of the variable), but
unstructured text data could be used to infer proxies. For this setting, our method combines proximal
causal inference with zero-shot classifiers.

Proximal causal inference (Miao et al., 2018; Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2024) can
identify the true causal effect given two proxies for the unmeasured confounder that satisfy certain
causal identification conditions. A major criticism of this method is that it can be difficult to find two
suitable proxies among the structured variables; however, we conjecture that unstructured text data (if
available) could be a rich source of potential proxies.

In our proposed method, summarized in Figure 1, we estimate two proxies from text data via zero-shot
classifiers, i.e. classifiers that perform an unseen task with no supervised examples. In subsequent
sections, we expand upon this method and its assumptions and empirically validate it on synthetic and
semi-synthetic data with real-world clinical notes. Since large pre-trained language models (LLMs)
have promising performance on zero-shot classification benchmarks (Yin et al., 2019; Brown et al.,
2020; Wei et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021, inter alia), we use LLMs to infer both of the proxies in our
experimental pipeline. Our combination of proximal causal inference and zero-shot classifiers is not
only novel, but also expands the set of text-specific causal designs available to practitioners.2

• We propose a new causal inference method that uses distinct instances of pre-treatment text data,
infers two proxies from two different zero-shot models on the instances, and applies the proxies in
the proximal g-formula (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020).
• We provide theoretical proofs that our method satisfies the identification conditions of proximal
causal inference and prove that other seemingly reasonable alternative methods do not.
• We propose a falsification heuristic that uses the odds ratio of the proxies conditional on observed
covariates as an approximation of the (untestable) proximal causal inference conditions.
• In synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments using MIMIC-III’s real-world clinical notes (Johnson
et al., 2016), our odds ratio heuristic correctly flags when identification conditions are violated.
When the heuristic passes, causal estimates from our method have low bias and confidence intervals
that cover the true parameter; when the heuristic fails, causal estimates are often biased.

Figure 2: Causal DAGs (a) depicting unmea-
sured confounding and (b) compatible with
the canonical assumptions used for proximal
causal inference (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al.,
2020).

To motivate our approach, imagine we are an applied
practitioner tasked with determining the effectiveness
of thrombolytic (clot busting) medications relative
to blood thinning medications to treat clots arising
from an ischemic stroke. Such medications are usu-
ally administered within three hours of the stroke to
improve chances of patient recovery (Zaheer et al.,
2011). Given the urgency and the short treatment
window, running a randomized experiment to com-
pare these drugs is difficult. Left with only obser-
vational data, we examine electronic health records
(EHRs) from a database like MIMIC-III (Johnson
et al., 2016).

We formalize our causal estimand as follows: let
A denote a binary treatment variable corresponding
to clot busting (A = 1) or blood thinning (A = 0)
medication, and let Y denote measurements of the D-dimer protein in the patient’s blood which
directly measures how much of the clotting has dissolved. In do-calculus notation (Pearl, 2009), the
target causal estimand is the average causal effect, ACE := E[Y | do(A = 1)] −E[Y | do(A = 0)].

Examining the EHRs, we find potential confounders (in structured tabular form), including biological
factors, such as age, sex, and blood pressure, as well as socio-economic factors, such as income. We
denote the observed confounders as the set C. However, we are worried about biased causal effects
because atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythms) is an important confounder corresponding to a
pre-existing heart condition that is not recorded in the structured data. We denote this unmeasured
confounder as U, and assume for the rest of this paper that C and U form a sufficient backdoor
adjustment set with respect to A and Y (Pearl, 1995). Figure 2(a) depicts this problem setup in the
form of a causal directed acyclic graph (causal DAG) (Spirtes et al., 2000; Pearl, 2009). With the
presence of U, it is well known that adjusting for just the observed confounders via the backdoor
formula P
c(E[Y |A = 1, c] −E[Y |A = 0, c]) × p(c) will give a biased estimate of the ACE (Pearl,
1995). In response to this issue, we consider work that uses proxy variables of the unmeasured
confounder. However, we are subject to the following restriction:

(R1) We do not have access to the value of U for any individuals in the dataset.

This kind of restriction is common in healthcare or social science settings when data privacy issues,
high costs, or lack of expert labor make analysts unable to hand-label unstructured text data. We
elaborate in Appendix A.

In such cases, we turn to using proxies for U. Pearl (2010) proposed a method for obtaining unbiased
effect estimates with a single proxy W under the assumption that p(W|U) is known or estimable,
which are impossible for us under (R1). However, a more recent line of work, building from
Griliches (1977) and Kuroki and Pearl (2014), called proximal causal inference (Miao et al., 2018;
Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020) is able to identify the true causal effect as long as the analyst proposes
two proxies W and Z that satisfy the following independence conditions:

3


---Page Break---
(P1) Conditional independence of proxies: W ⊥⊥Z | U, C
(P2) One of the proxies, say W, does not depend on values of the treatment: W ⊥⊥A | U, C
(P3) The other proxy, Z, does not depend on values of the outcome: Z ⊥⊥Y | A, U, C

A canonical example of proxies that satisfy these conditions is shown in Figure 2(b)3. In addition to
these independence relations that impose the absence of certain edges in the causal DAG, e.g., no
edge can be present between Z and W to satisfy (P1), there is an additional completeness condition
that imposes the existence of U →Z and U →W. This condition is akin to the relevance condition
in the instrumental variables literature Angrist et al. (1996) and ensures that the proxies W and Z
exhibit sufficient variability relative to the variability of U.

(P4) Completeness: for any square integrable function v(·) and for all values w, a, c, we have
E[v(U) | w, a, c] = 0 ⇐⇒v(U) = 0, and E[v(Z) | w, a, c] = 0 ⇐⇒v(Z) = 0.

Intuitively, these completeness conditions do not hold unless Z and W truly hold some predictive
value for the unmeasured confounder U. See Miao et al. (2018) for more details on completeness.
Under (P1-P4), each piece of the ACE, E[Y | do(A = a)], is identified via the proximal g-formula,

E[Y | do(a)] =
X

w,c
h(a, w, c) × p(w, c),
(1)

where h(a, w, c) is the “outcome confounding bridge function” that is a solution to the equation
E[Y |a, z, c] = P

w h(a, w, c)×p(w|a, z, c) (Miao et al., 2018). Although the existence of a solution
is guaranteed under (P1-P4), solving it can still be difficult. However, there exist simple two-stage
regression estimators for the proximal g-formula (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020; Mastouri et al.,
2021) that we make use of in Section 5 once we have identified a valid pair of proxies. This brings us
to the primary criticism of proximal causal inference.

Primary criticism
When using proximal causal inference in practice, how do we find two proxies
W and Z among the structured variables such that they happen to satisfy all of (P1-P4)? We often
cannot, at least not without a high degree of domain knowledge.4 Furthermore, empirically testing
for any of (P1-P3) in general is, by definition of the problem, not possible because doing so requires
complete access to the unobserved confounder U.

Our approach
Instead, in this work, we propose relying on raw unstructured text data (e.g., clinical
notes) in an attempt to infer proxies that satisfy (P1-P4) by design.

Returning to our motivating problem, our approach applies classifiers zero-shot—since we have no
training data with U given (R1)—to two distinct instances of pre-treatment clinical notes of each
patient and obtains two predictions, W and Z, for atrial fibrillation (our U). In order to make it more
feasible to estimate the ACE from data, we make the following two relatively weak assumptions:

(S1) The unmeasured confounder U between A and Y can be specified as a binary variable.
(S2) The text only causes W and Z (and no other variables).

Assuming (S1) simplifies estimation since text classification typically performs better empirically
than text regression (Wang et al., 2022). Assumption (S2) asserts that the text data considered serves
as a record of events rather than actionable data.5

3One could also add the edges W →Y and Z →A to Figure 2(b), but these relations will not show up
in our text-based setting. Shpitser et al. (2023) also propose a general proximal identification algorithm that
is compatible with other causal DAGs, but we focus on the canonical proximal learning assumptions stated in
Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (2020).
4For instance, suppose we aim to find proxies (in the structured variables) of atrial fibrillation (U) and have
access to shortness of breath and heart palpitations. Although these proxies seem reasonable, we show how
they may violate the proximal causal inference conditions. Patient complaints about shortness of breath may
affect which medication a clinician prescribes (A); hence, using shortness of breath as the proxy W violates
(P2). Furthermore, a lack of oxygen resulting from shortness of breath may affect the healing of blood clots,
thus influencing measurements of the D-dimer protein Y . In this case, using shortness of breath as the proxy Z
violates (P3). Shortness of breath can also sometimes be a symptom of heart palpitations, violating (P1).
5We present an example of how to relax this assumption in Appendix B. We leave to future work more
complicated scenarios, e.g., if the reader’s perception of text differs from the writer’s intent Pryzant et al. (2021).

Designing Text-Based Proxies

In this section, we describe our method for designing text-based proxies. In doing so, we describe
various “gotchas,” pitfalls in attempting to use these text-based proxies in causal effect estimation.
We describe each gotcha and explore how they lead us to our final recommended design, given by
Figure 3(d). Our empirical results in Section 5 demonstrate, as expected, that these pitfall approaches
result in biased causal effect estimates.

Gotcha #1: Using predictions directly in backdoor adjustment.
Suppose we try to avoid the
complications of proximal causal inference by using the predictions from one of our zero-shot models,
say W, as the confounding variable itself.

Proposition 1. Using a proxy W in the backdoor adjustment formula results in biased estimates of
the ACE in general.

Proof. If W ̸= U for some subset of instances, there remains an open backdoor path through U,
and the ACE remains biased as P

U,C(E[Y | A = 1, U, C] −E[Y | A = 0, U, C]) × p(U, C) ̸=
P

W,C(E[Y | A = 1, W, C] −E[Y | A = 0, W, C]) × p(W, C) in general (Pearl, 1995).

The most straightforward way to obtain unbiased results under Gotcha #1 is to have 100% accuracy
between W and U, a scenario that is extremely unlikely in the real world. Further, under (R1)6, we
cannot measure accuracy at inference time since we do not have any observations of U. As expected,
in our semi-synthetic experiments in Section 5, we find using predictions of W directly in a backdoor
adjustment formula results in biased estimates; see Figure 4.

Gotcha #2: Using post-treatment text.
While it is well-known that adjusting for post-treatment
covariates in the backdoor formula often leads to bias (Pearl, 2009), it is not obvious what might go
wrong when using post-treatment text to infer proxies for the proximal g-formula.

Proposition 2. If both W and Z are inferred from zero-shot models on text that contain post-treatment
information, then the resulting proxies violate either (P2), (P3), or both.

Proof. Consider Figure 3(a), where the proxies are produced using text that is post-outcome and thus
also post-treatment. We show that this violates both (P2) and (P3). Clearly the DAG violates (P3): by
a simple d-separation argument we see that Z ̸⊥⊥Y | A, U, C due to the open path Y →T
Z.
Similarly, (P2) is violated from the open path A →Y →T
W.

Thus, before performing zero-shot inference, it is important that the text for each individual is filtered
in such a way that it contains only the text preceding treatment7. In our running clinical example, we
can avoid this gotcha by using the time stamps of the clinical notes and information about when the
patient was treated and discharged.

6In the absence of (R1), we direct readers to work that adjusts via measurement error estimates or assumptions
that U is “missing at random” Wood-Doughty et al. (2018).
7In Appendix B we show how proxies could be inferred using a mix of pre- and post-treatment text while
satisfying (P1-P3). However, we advocate for the the pre-treatment rule due to its simplicity.

5


---Page Break---
Gotcha #3: Predicting both proxies from the same instance of text.
After filtering to only
pre-treatment text, Tpre, for each individual, the intuitive next step is to use Tpre to infer W and Z.

Proposition 3. If W and Z are inferred via zero-shot models on the same instance of pre-treatment
text, the resulting proxies violate (P1).

Proof. Consider the causal DAG with proxies W and Z in Fig 3(b). By d-separation we have
W ̸⊥⊥Z | U, C due to the path Z
Tpre
W.

In our synthetic experiments in Section 5, we find inferring proxies from the same instance of text
results in biased estimates; see Table 1. To avoid Gotcha #3, we select two distinct instances of
pre-treatment text data for each unit of analysis, Tpre
1
and Tpre
2 , such that Tpre
1
⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C8.
For example, in the clinical setting we use metadata to select two separate categories of notes for
each individual patient, e.g., nursing notes and echocardiogram notes. We hypothesize this satisfies
Tpre
1
⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C since different providers will likely write reports that differ in content and style.
Although the availability of distinct instances is domain-dependent, we hypothesize this type of data
exists in other domains as well; for example, one could select distinct social media posts written by
the same individual or multiple speeches given by the same politician.

Gotcha #4: Using a single zero-shot model.
After splitting text into Tpre
1
and Tpre
2 , should we
apply the same zero-shot model to these two instances of text to infer the proxies W and Z, as in
Figure 3(c), or should we apply two separate zero-shot models as in Figure 3(d)? We find different
answers in theory and practice. Proposition 4 shows that, in theory, both are valid as long as
Tpre
1
⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C. However, we later describe how our semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate
the need for two different models in practice in Section 5. We first establish the theoretical validity of
both strategies.

Proposition 4. If W and Z are inferred using zero-shot classification on two unique instances of
pre-treatment text such that Tpre
1
⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C, then these proxies satisfy (P1-P3). Additionally, if
the proxies are predictive of U, i.e., Z ̸⊥⊥U | C and W ̸⊥⊥U | C, then (P4) holds.

Proof. Suppose we apply zero-shot classification models to two splits of pre-treatment text in a way
that results in causal DAGs shown in Figure 3(c) or (d) depending on whether we use one or two
models, respectively. Applying d-separation confirms that the conditions (P1-P3) hold in both cases.

Let |XV | denote the number of categories of a variable V . Kuroki and Pearl (2014); Tchetgen Tch-
etgen et al. (2020) state that when W and Z are predictive of U (as stated in the proposition), a
sufficient condition for (P4) is min(|XZ|, |XW |) ≥|XU|. Since U is binary under (S1) and since
W and Z are discrete variables because they are inferred from classifiers, this condition is satisfied.
Hence, (P4) is satisfied.

Our Final Design Procedure
Figure 1 and the causal DAG in Figure 3(d) summarize our final
design procedure—obtain two distinct instances of pre-treatment text for each individual and apply
two distinct zero-shot models to obtain W and Z.

In Proposition 4, we formalized how this procedure can be used to design proxies that satisfy the
proximal conditions (P1-P4). However, this result relied on two important pre-conditions: (1) the
conditional independence of the two instances of text, and (2) W and Z being (at least weakly)
predictive of U. Yet, both of these conditions are untestable in general; this motivates the next section.

4
Falsification: Odds Ratio Heuristic

In practice, a major challenge for our procedure—and indeed all causal methods—are its assumptions.
Sometimes, causal models imply testable restrictions on the observed data that can be used in
falsification or confirmation tests of model assumptions, see Wang et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2023);
Bhattacharya and Nabi (2022) for tests of some popular models. In our case, the proximal model

8Note this independence condition does not imply the two pieces of text are completely uncorrelated. Since
the text is written based on observations of the same individual, we certainly expect Tpre
1 ̸⊥⊥Tpre
2 ; we simply
require that the two pieces are correlated only due to C and U.

Algorithm 1 for inferring two text-based proxies

2: Select two distinct instances of pre-treatment text Tpre
1 and Tpre
2 from T
3: Infer Z ←M1(Tpre
1 ) and W ←M2(Tpre
2 )
4: Compute the confidence interval (CI) for γW Z.C, (γCI low
W Z.C, γCI high
W Z.C)

5: if 1 < γCI low
W Z.C and γCI high
W Z.C < γhigh then return W and Z
6: else return “stop”

implies no testable restrictions (Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020), so the best we can do is provide
a falsification heuristic that allows analysts to detect serious violations of (P1-P4) when using the
inferred proxies and stop analysis. Our heuristic is based on the odds ratio function described below.

Given arbitrary reference values w0 and z0, the conditional odds ratio function for W and Z given
covariates X is defined as Chen (2007), OR(w, z | x) =
p(w|z,x)
p(w0|z,x) × p(w0|z0,x)

p(w|z0,x) . This function is
important because W ⊥⊥Z | X if and only if OR(w, z | x) = 1 for all values w, z, x. We summarize
this odds ratio as a single free parameter, γW Z.X, and, for the simplicity of our pipeline, we estimate
it under a parametric model for p(W|Z, X)9.

Now, we describe our proximal conditions in terms of odds ratio parameters. If (P1-P3) are satisfied,
then W ⊥⊥Z | U, C and γW Z.UC = 1. Further, if the zero-shot models are truly predictive of U,
then (P4) is satisfied and W ̸⊥⊥Z | C, which means that γW Z.C ̸= 1. Ideally, we would want
to estimate both of these odds ratio parameters to confirm (P1-P4) empirically; however, γW Z.UC
cannot be computed from observed data alone due to (R1).

Using a parameter we can estimate from observed data, γW Z.C, we propose an odds ratio falsification
heuristic in lines 3-6 of Algorithm 1. Now, we explain why, if this heuristic holds, an analyst can be
reasonably confident in using their inferred text-based proxies for estimation.

First, we examine a lower bound on γW Z.C. Based on our previous discussion, if γW Z.C is close
to 1, then we should suspect that one or both of our zero-shot models failed to return informative
predictions for U. Next, let us treat γW Z.C as an imperfect approximation of γW Z.UC. Let W, Z, U
be binary with reference values w0 = z0 = u0 = 0. VanderWeele (2008) proposed the following
three conditions under which an odds ratio γW Z.C that fails to adjust for an unmeasured confounder
U is an overestimate of the true odds ratio γW Z.UC: (i) {U} ∪C satisfies the backdoor criterion with
respect to W and Z; (ii) U is univariate or consists of independent components conditional on C; (iii)
E[W|u, z, c] is non-decreasing in U for all z and c and E[Z|u, c] is non-decreasing in U for all c.

Condition (i) is satisfied from Graph 3(d), and condition (ii) is satisfied by assumption (S1). Finally,
condition (iii) is satisfied when our zero-shot models are reasonable predictors of the unmeasured
confounder U by the following argument. Notice that E[W|u, z, c] = E[W|u, c] = p(W = 1|u, c),
where the first equality follows from d-separation in Graph 3(d) and the second equality follows from
the definition of expectation for binary variable W. Then we should expect, if the zero-shot models
are reasonably accurate, that p(W = 1|U = 1, c) > p(W = 1|U = 0, c). Therefore, the first part of
condition (iii) is satisfied. Similar logic holds for E[Z|u, c].

Hence, we have shown that under ideal conditions that satisfy (P1-P4), we should expect γW Z.C >
γW Z.UC = 1, and we should reject proxies W and Z when we observe an odds ratio γW Z.C ≤1.
Next, we examine the upper bound on γW Z.C. Consider the extreme case where γW Z.C = ∞. This
corresponds to a situation where W = Z, so (P1) is clearly not satisfied. In general, if γW Z.C is
higher than some threshold γhigh, corresponding to the maximum association that one could reasonably
explain by a single open path through U, we should suspect that perhaps the proxies W and Z are
associated with each other due to additional paths through other unmeasured variables that make it so
that the two instances of text are not independent of each other, i.e., Tpre
1
̸⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C.

Following standard practice in sensitivity analysis, e.g., Liu et al. (2013); Leppälä (2023), we leave
it to the analyst to specify the upper bound γhigh based on domain knowledge. In our experiments
in Section 5, we found that, when the proximal conditions are not satisfied, γW Z.C far exceeds

9More generally, the odds ratio can be treated as a finite p-dimensional parameter vector γ and estimated
under semi-parametric restrictions on p(W|Z, X) and p(Z|W, X) (Chen, 2007; Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2010).

any reasonable setting of γhigh. Hence, our heuristic works quite well in practice even with a
generous suggestion for an upper bound. We describe our full design procedure with the diagnostic in
Algorithm 1 and calculate 95% confidence intervals for γW Z.C via the bootstrap percentile method
(Wasserman, 2004). We now evaluate its effectiveness for downstream causal inference.

Empirical Experiments and Results

RQs
In this section, we explore the following empirical research questions (RQs): How does
Algorithm 1 compare to other alternatives in terms of bias and confidence interval coverage of the
estimated causal effects? Does our odds ratio heuristic effectively flag when to stop or proceed?

In causal inference, empirical evaluation is difficult because it requires ground-truth labels for
counterfactual outcomes of an individual under multiple versions of the treatment, data that is
generally impossible to obtain (Holland, 1986). Thus, we turn to synthetic data and semi-synthetic
data so we have access to the true ACE and U to evaluate methods. Semi-synthetic experiments—
which use real data for part of the DGP and then specify synthetic relationships for the remainder of
the DGP—have been used extensively for other empirical evaluation of causal estimation methods;
see Shimoni et al. (2018); Dorie et al. (2019); Veitch et al. (2020).10 We describe the experimental
set-ups, the causal estimation procedure used by all experiments, and finally, the results to our RQs.

10Gentzel et al. (2019) and Keith et al. (2023) describe methods for evaluation that are more realistic than
semi-synthetic evaluation by downsampling an RCT dataset to create an observational (confounded) dataset.
However, for the proximal setting we investigated in this paper, we could not find a suitable existing RCT.

Fully Synthetic Experiments
We create our fully synthetic DGP based on the DAG in Figure 3(d);
see Appendix C for full details. To summarize, A and U are binary, and Y and C are continuous.
We generate (very simple) synthetic text data with four continuous variables, X1, X2, X3, X4, as
functions of U and C. For training, we generate two realizations of these variables, which we call
Xtrain
1
and Xtrain
2
, and likewise two realizations for inference time, Xinf
1 and Xinf
2 .

At inference time, we explore using one or two zero-shot models, which we refer to as Proximal 1-
Model (P1M) and Proximal 2-Model (P2M), respectively. For one zero-shot model, we train a logistic
regression classifier to predict the true U from an aggregated variable eXtrain = (Xtrain
1
+ Xtrain
2
)/2
as Pθ(U = 1| eXtrain)11. For the other zero-shot model, we use the following heuristic: predict 1
if X1 > 1.1 else 0. P1M uses only the logistic regression model, and P2M uses both the logistic
regression and heuristic models. Next, we vary whether Gotcha #3 holds at inference time for both
P1M and P2M, i.e. whether the models infer Z and W from only Xinf
1 or both Xinf
1 and Xinf
2 .

Semi-Synthetic Experiments
For our semi-synthetic experiments, we use MIMIC-III, a de-
identified dataset of patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital (Johnson
et al., 2016). See Appendices D and G for detailed pre-processing steps, variables, and DGP. To
summarize, we use the following real data from MIMIC-III in our DGP: ICD-9 code diagnoses,
demographic information, and unstructured text notes. We choose the four diagnoses for oracle U that
had the best F1 scores for a supervised bag-of-words logistic regression classifier (see Appendix E for
full results): atrial fibrillation (Afib), congestive heart failure (Heart), coronary atherosclerosis of the
native coronary artery (A-Sis), and hypertension (Hypertension). To avoid Gotcha #2, we explicitly
exclude discharge summaries, which are post-treatment. In each experiment, we choose two out of the
following four note categories as Tpre
1 and Tpre
2 : electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (Echo),
Radiology, and Nursing notes. We hypothesize that notes written about different aspects of clinical
care and by different providers will likely satisfy Tpre
1
⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C since each individual will write
a conditionally independent realization of the patient’s status. In Appendix I, we find distinct unigram
vocabularies between the note sets that pass our falsification heuristic, lending preliminary evidence
to this assumption of conditional independence. Consistent with the DAG in Figure 3(d), we then
synthetically generate binary A and continuous Y .

For our zero-shot models, we use FLAN-T5 XXL (Flan) Chung et al. (2024) and OLMo-7B-
Instruct (OLMo) Groeneveld et al. (2024), both “open” instruction-tuned large language models. In
Appendix F, we elaborate on our choice of these models. Following Ziems et al. (2024), we use the
prompt template ‘Context: {Tpre} \nIs it likely the patient has {U}?\nConstraint: Even if you are
uncertain, you must pick either “Yes” or “No” without using any other words.’ We assign 1 when the
output from Flan or OLMo contains ‘Yes’ and 0 otherwise. P1M uses Flan for both proxies W and Z
while P2M uses Flan for W and OLMo for Z. We compare P1M and P2M to a baseline that uses the
inferred proxy W from Flan directly in a backdoor adjustment formula, corresponding to Gotcha #1.

Estimation of Proximal g-formula
For all experiments, we estimate the ACE by using the
inferred W and Z in a two-stage linear regression estimator for the proximal g-formula provided
by Tchetgen Tchetgen et al.. Although the linearity assumption is restrictive, it allows us to focus
on evaluating the efficacy of our proposed method for inferring text-based proxies as opposed to
complications with non-linear proximal estimation (Mastouri et al., 2021). Briefly, we first fit a linear
regression E[W|A, Z, C]. Next, we infer c
W, continuous probabilistic predictions for W, using the
fitted model. For the second stage, we fit a linear model for E[Y |A, c
W, C]. The coefficient for A in
this second linear model is the estimated ACE. We calculate 95% confidence intervals for the ACE via
the bootstrap percentile method (Wasserman, 2004). See Appendix F for additional implementation
details (e.g., addressing class imbalance and sample splitting).

Results
Table 1 has synthetic results, and Tables 2 and Figure 4 have selected results for the
semi-synthetic experiments. See Appendices E, H, and J for additional results. In short, our empirical
results corroborate preference for Algorithm 1 over the baseline.

First, we discuss the “gotcha” methods we showed to be theoretically incorrect in Section 3. Regarding
Gotcha #1, Figure 4 shows that, across all settings of U, using the inferred W directly in the backdoor

11Of course, having access to the true U may not qualify as “zero-shot” in the strict sense of the term, but we
complement this idealized scenario with the difficult true zero-shot scenario in our semi-synthetic experiments.

adjustment formula results in estimates with large bias. Regarding Gotcha #3 in the fully synthetic
experiments, using the same realization Xinf
1 results in high bias—0.130 and 0.107 for P1M and
P2M, respectively, in Table 1—and CIs that do not cover the true ACE. Regarding Gotcha #4, as in
Proposition 4, using a single zero-shot model (P1M) results in low bias in the idealized setting of the
synthetic DGP (Table 1; first row). However, using real clinical notes and Flan, the second columns
of Figure 4 show that P1M produces estimates with higher bias compared to P2M across all three
settings. We hypothesize this could be due to Flan over-relying on its pre-training and thus making
similar predictions regardless of the clinical note.

For all experiments we set γhigh = 2. With this setting, we find low bias and good CI coverage for
the two settings that pass our heuristic (P2M for U = A-Sis with Echo and Radiology notes and
P2M for U = Heart with Echo and Nursing notes) and biased estimates in other cases. Although the
confidence intervals sometimes cover the true ACE in settings that fail the heuristic, the interval is
skewed and appears will asymptotically converge to a biased value. This gives us confidence that
Algorithm 1 appropriately flags when to stop or proceed.

Understanding why the odds ratio heuristic fails for a specific application requires oracle data.
However, it may be helpful for analysts to reason about scenarios that influence this failure, such
as when C and U are not a sufficient backdoor adjustment set; Tpre
1
̸⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C; or Z and W
are poorly predictive of U. Using oracle data, we examined these scenarios for a few settings of
our semi-synthetic experiments. For example, Figure 4 (right-most panel) shows that U=A-Sis with
nursing and radiology notes fails the odds ratio heuristic. We qualitatively examined samples of
the clinical notes and found some had unmeasured confounding, e.g., a patient had lung cancer—a
variable that was not in our C or U—that influenced descriptions in both Tpre
1
and Tpre
2 . Figure 9
(bottom right-most panel) shows that for U=hypertension with echocardiogram (echo) and nursing
notes also fails the odds ratio heuristic. However, we hypothesize this is due not to text dependence
(see Table 4), but rather that the proxies W and Z have accuracies of 0.49 and 0.52 respectively (when
evaluated against oracle U), which is lower accuracy than predicting the majority class (Table 21).
We leave to future work disaggregating the odds ratio heuristic into tests for these specific scenarios.

Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work

In this work we proposed a novel causal inference method for estimating causal effects in observational
studies when a confounding variable is completely unobserved but unstructured text data is available
to infer potential proxies. Our method uses distinct instances of pre-treatment text data, infers two
proxies using two zero-shot models on the instances, and applies these proxies in the proximal
g-formula. We have shown why one should prefer our method to alternatives, both in theory and in
the empirical results of synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments.

If the conditions we present hold, the estimates will be unbiased. Further, as the underlying predictive
accuracy of Z and W improve, the confidence interval width will narrow. Thus, we see promise in
work improving the zero-shot performance of LLMs. Future work could possibly combine proxies
from a greater number of zero shot models, i.e. inspired by work in Yang et al. (2024).

Although we are careful to infer valid proxies by design, it is generally impossible to empirically
test whether conditions for proximal causal inference are fulfilled. To address this, we proposed an
odds ratio falsification heuristic test, but acceptable values of γhigh depend on the domain. If these
are set incorrectly, our method could result in false positives (a setting for which the CI does not
cover the true parameter and the estimated ACE is biased). In addition, our approach depends on the
availability of pre-treatment text data and metadata to split text into independent pieces, which are
not available across all applied settings.

Although we use a clinical setting as our running example, our method is applicable to many
other domains where it is infeasible to obtain ground-truth U labels due to privacy constraints or
annotation costs, e.g., social media or education studies with private messaging data or sensitive
student coursework. Other directions for future work include incorporating non-linear proximal
estimators (including ones that use alternative assumptions to the completeness condition in (P4)
(Kallus et al., 2021)), expanding beyond text to proxies learned from other modalities (see Knox et al.
(2022)), providing more guidance for setting γhigh in our odds ratio heuristic, extending our method
to incorporate categorical U, W, Z, and using soft probabilistic outputs from the zero-shot classifiers.

Elaboration on Problem Restriction

Restriction (R1) is clearly present in settings for which we need to adjust for a confouding variable
that is impossible or difficult to measure—for example, atrial fibrillation can go undiagnosed for
years. A logical first attempt to mitigate this constraint is to train a supervised classifier on a subset
of the data to create proxies for the rest of the dataset, as explored in Wood-Doughty et al. (2018).
This, however, requires humans to hand-label large amounts of text data. If labeling takes place
on a crowd-sourcing platform, e.g., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, crowd-sourcing costs can quickly
sky-rocket and often exceed tens of thousands of dollars, even for small datasets. Furthermore, many
datasets—particularly those in clinical settings—require domain expertise (e.g., trained medical
doctors) which will likely increase costs significantly and limit the availability of labelers.

Cost and expertise of labelers aside, the possibility of supervised learning is further restricted by
patient privacy legislation. We typically cannot transport sensitive data regarding patients’ personal
data to platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for labeling due to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)12 in the United States. In addition, legal acts such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)13 in the European Union and the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA)14 restrict the movement and repurposing of user data across platforms. Our
proposed method overcomes restriction (R1) by using zero-shot learners that do not require previously
labeled examples.

B
Using Post-Treatment or Actionable Text Data

Here, we first describe a scenario for which we may infer valid proxies using both post-treatment
and pre-treatment text. In Figure 5, Tpost is post-treatment text whereas Tpre is pre-treatment text.
Through simple d-separation arguments, we can see that each of (P1-P3) are fulfilled. Hence, it is still
possible to use post-treatment text to generate valid proxies as long as we use pre-treatment text to
generate one proxy and post-treatment text to generate the other. However, requiring both instances
of text data to be pre-treatment is simpler to implement and validate, so we recommend this rule in
our final method.

Figure 6 further illustrates an example where we can use actionable text to generate valid proxies.
Suppose Tact is an instance of text data that influences a health practitioner’s decision to assign
different treatments to a patient, and Tpre is an instance of pre-treatment text that is not actionable.
Then, Tact has a direct edge to the treatment A. Despite the addition of this edge, we can apply
d-separation again to verify that (P1-P3) are still fulfilled. Therefore, our proposed method is still
valid in a more relaxed setting where clinicians use one instance of the text data to make treatment
decisions as long as the other instance of text data is both pre-treatment and not actionable.

The DAG representing the fully synthetic data-generating process is shown in Figure 7. We simulate
U, a binary variable, as follows

U ∼Bernoulli(0.48)

Next, we simulate baseline confounders and synthetic “text” X1, X2, X3, X4 as follows:

C ∼N(0, 1)
X1 ∼N(0, 1) + 1.95 ∗U + 3 ∗C
X2 ∼N(0, 1) + exp(X1) + U + 3 ∗C
X3 ∼N(0, 1) + 1.25 ∗U + 3 ∗C

X4 ∼N(0, 1) + X3
2 + 0.5 ∗X3
3

+ U + 3 ∗C

Finally, the treatment and outcome variables are generated via

p(A = 1) = expit(0.8 ∗U + C −0.3)
A ∼Bernoulli(p(A = 1))
Y ∼N(0, 1) + 1.3 ∗A + 0.8 ∗U + C

In the fully synthetic data-generating process, increasing the coefficient for the variable C decreases
the odds ratio conditional on observed confounders γW Z.C while decreasing the coefficient for the
variable C increases γW Z.C.

MIMIC-III Pre-Processing Steps

In the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), data is organized into multiple tables. Patients are
anonymized and each have a unique identifier. In addition, each unique hospital admission is assigned
a hospital admission identification number (HAID). Each patient can have multiple HAIDs, and each
HAID can have multiple notes (e.g., an ECG note and a nursing note). Our pre-processing steps are
outlined in the following steps:

16


---Page Break---
1. We start with the table in MIMIC-III containing the clinicians’ notes for all patients and
drop rows of data where the HAID has a missing value. We refer to this main table we are
working with as our reference table.
2. Next, for each unique patient in the reference table, we select one HAID by choosing the
HAID with the earliest “chart date,” the day on which the clinician’s note was recorded. We
limit each patient to only one hospital admission to better fit the assumption of i.i.d. data
(which would be violated if there were multiple hospital admissions for a single patient
since these multiple admissions would be dependent).
3. We drop all clinicians’ notes that have the category label “Discharge summary” because
such notes would be considered post-treatment text that violate (P2) as we have shown in
Section 3. For each HAID, we combine separate notes of the same category into one string.
4. We now move on to the table in MIMIC-III that contains information on which patients
were given which medical diagnoses for each HAID. For each HAID in the reference table,
we select all the diagnoses (ICD-9 codes) assigned to the patient in that hospital visit.
5. The 10 most common diagnoses for the patients in our reference table are, in order, hyper-
tension, coronary atherosclerosis of the native coronary artery, atrial fibrillation, congestive
heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, acute kidney failure, need for vaccination
against viral hepatitis, suspected newborn infection, and acute respiratory failure. In our
reference table, we add a column for each of these 10 diagnoses and record a 0 or a 1 that
indicates whether each patient was assigned a diagnosis for each condition on a particular
hospital admission.
6. From the table containing baseline information for each patient, we append onto the refer-
ence table the gender and age of each patient. We infer each patient’s age by subtracting
the “chart date” of the patient’s clinician’s note by the patient’s date of birth. We drop from
the reference table all patients with an age less than 18 or greater than 100. We drop the
diagnosis suspected newborn infection from the reference table because we have eliminated
all patients younger than 18. At this stage in the preprocessing pipeline, the total number of
HAIDs, or rows of data, in the reference table is 990,172.
7. In the final step, we evaluate which pairs of note categories are the most often simultaneously
recorded for patients on the same hospital admission in the reference table. The top 5
simultaneously recorded note category pairs are Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Radiology
with 27,963 HAIDs, Nursing and ECG with 18,505 HAIDs, Nursing and Radiology with
18,302 HAIDs, ECG and Echocardiogram (Echo) with 17,291 HAIDs, and Echo and
Radiology with 15,558 HAIDs. We consider these 5 pairs of note categories for downstream
proximal causal inference.

E
Diagnosing Signal With Oracle Text Classifiers

To ensure that the text contains predictive signal for the diagnoses (a precondition necessary to use our
zero-shot classifiers later on in our analysis), we train supervised classifiers to predict the diagnoses,
Y , separately using text data from each note category, X, with a bag-of-words representation.

Our procedure is as follows. We first truncate all of the clinicians’ notes data to 470 tokens (due to the
context window of Flan-T5 which we use later in our pipeline). We ignore oracles and note categories
combinations where positivity rates are 0 or 1 after subsetting on the note category in question. We
then use the scikit-learn library’s CountVectorizer to convert the text data to bag of words features
with vocabulary size 5, 000 and train a linear logistic regression with the hyperparameter penalty
set to “None”. We further calculate the F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall with the scikit-learn
library Pedregosa et al. (2011). The results are summarized in Table 3.

We choose oracles with at least two note categories that achieve F1 scores greater than 0.7 for
downstream inference with zero-shot classifiers. Such oracles and note categories are:

1. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with ECG, Echo, and Nursing notes.
2. Congestive heart failure (Heart) with Echo and Nursing notes.
3. Coronary atherosclerosis of the native coronary artery (A-sis) with Echo, Nursing, and
Radiology notes.

Table 3: Descending order of F1 scores (as well as accuracy, precision and recall) from bag of
words linear logistic regressions predicting various medical diagnoses from the MIMIC-III dataset
using different medical note categories as input. We set 0.7 as our F1 score cutoff for choosing the
diagnoses to use in downstream analysis with zero-shot classifiers (dashed horizontal line). We bold
the diagnoses that passed this threshold and also have at least two note categories. We used these
(bolded) diagnoses in the final oracle U in downstream analyses.

F
LLM and Estimation Details

Choosing LLMs: FLAN and OLMo
We used the large language models FLAN-T5 XXL and
OLMo-7B-Instruct for inferring the oracle diagnoses from text data Chung et al. (2024); Groeneveld
et al. (2024). These are both fully “open” models in that we have full knowledge of their pre-training
data, training objectives, and training details, and can be downloaded and updated on a local machine,
all of which are important for reproducible science (Palmer et al., 2024). We chose these two models
because they have been fine-tuned for zero-shot classification and because they have been trained
on different text corpora. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Flan will perform well on clinical notes
because, according to Dodge et al. (2021)’s analysis, C4 (the pre-training data in Flan-T5) has
among its top 25 domains patents.google.com, journals.plos.org, link.springer.com,
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, all of which likely contain medical text.

Creating inferences from FLAN and OLMo
We use the following string as the prompt for both
models: ‘Context: {Tpre} \nIs it likely the patient has {U}?\nConstraint: Even if you are uncertain,
you must pick either “Yes” or “No” without using any other words.’ We consider only the first five
tokens of output for both models and assign a value of 1 for the proxy if the output string converted
to all lowercase characters contains the word ‘yes’ and 0 otherwise.

Odds ratio confidence interval estimation
We calculate a point estimate for the odds ratio γW Z.C
using the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2011) by first training a linear logistic regression with
W as the target outcome and {Z} ∪C as the features. Whenever the positivity rate of W is less
than 0.2 or greater than 0.8, i.e. there is a class imbalance, we set the hyperparameter class_weight
to “balanced”. This uses the values of W to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional
to class frequencies in the dataset. Regardless of whether we adjust for class imbalance, we set the
hyperparameter penalty to None to turn off regularization. Finally, we calculate the natural exponent
of the coefficient of Z as the point estimate for the odds ratio γW Z.C.

We calculate the confidence interval for the odds ratio by drawing 200 bootstrap samples and repeating
the steps above for each bootstrap sample to create a bootstrap distribution. We then take the 0.025th
and 0.975th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution as γCI low
W Z.C and γCI low
W Z.C, respectively.

Two-stage linear proximal causal inference estimator for the ACE
Following sample splitting
from the causal inference literature Hansen (2000), we start by splitting the semi-synthetic dataset into
two splits—split 1 and split 2—where both splits are 50% of the original dataset. We then train a linear
logistic regression using split 1 with W as the target outcome and {A, Z} ∪C as the features. Like in
the estimation procedure for the odds ratio, we set the hyperparameter class_weight to “balanced”
whenever there is a class imbalance in the target outcome W and always set the hyperparameter
penalty to None. Next, we make probabilistic predictions c
W for W with the previously trained
linear logistic regression model using split 2. Finally, we train a linear regression using split 2 of
the data with Y as the target outcome and {A, c
W} ∪C as the features. The coefficient of A in the
trained linear regression model is the estimate for the ACE.

We calculate the confidence interval for the ACE by drawing 200 bootstrap samples and repeating the
steps above for each bootstrap sample to create a bootstrap distribution. We then take the 0.025th
and 0.975th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution as the lower and upper bound of the confidence
interval for the ACE, respectively.

G
Semi-Synthetic Data Generating Process

The DAG representing the semi-synthetic data-generating process is shown in Figure 8. The variable
U represents atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, coronary atherosclerosis
of the native coronary artery, or hypertension, depending on the setting. We use the
reference table created in the pre-processing steps described in Section D of the Appendix and start
by normalizing the variable Age with the formula

Agei = Agei −¯XAge

σAge
.

We then simulate draws of the binary variable A via

p(A = 1) = expit(U + 0.9 ∗Gender
+ 0.9 ∗Age)
A ∼Bernoulli(p(A = 1))

Next, we simulate draws of the continuous variable Y from:

Y ∼N(0, 1) + 1.3 ∗A + U
+ 0.9 ∗Gender + 0.9 ∗Age

When estimating the ACE using the two-stage linear regression described in Section 5, we condition
on the baseline covariates Age and Gender as well the other diagnoses not being used as U.

H
Additional P2M Experiments

In Figure 9, we report additional experimental results from P1M using Flan to infer proxies from
both note categories and P2M using Flan and OLMo to infer proxies from one note category each.
As expected, using one inferred proxy from an LLM directly in backdoor adjustment produces biased
estimates for the ACE. When using P1M and P2M, the odds ratio falsification heuristic successfully

flags invalid estimates of the ACE. In the two cases where the inferred proxies pass the odds ratio
falsification heuristic, we observe valid estimates for the ACE.

A notable example of when the odds ratio heuristic correctly failed is for Echo and Nursing notes
on the diagnosis hypertension. As shown in Figure 9, the estimates for the ACE for both P1M and
P2M are far from the true ACE of 1.3. This is explained by Table 21 where the oracle odds ratios
between both proxies W and Z and the oracle U are nearly 1, suggesting that the zero-shot classifiers
were not able to accurately predict the oracle. As expected in such a scenario, the estimates for the
ACE are biased, and our odds ratio heuristic successfully detects the violation of Assumption (P4) for
proximal causal inference.

I
Examining Text Conditional Independence

Recall, our procedure requires us to split text such that Tpre
1
̸⊥⊥Tpre
2
| U, C. This condition must
hold at inference time when practioners are using our procedure and it must hold in the “real” part
of our semi-synthetic experiments in Section 5. Thus, for our semi-synthetic experiments with
real-world clinical notes, we aim to investigate when this condition does or does not hold. To the
best of our knowledge, it is an open problem on how to perform (conditional) independence tests on
high-dimensional, compositional language data. Instead, we turn to an approximation that can lend
us some preliminary evidence and examine the probabilities of top unigram features for each pairing
of text categories. We show the results in Tables 4 and 5 below.

After tokenization into unigrams, we select the top five features via tf-idf scores. The tf-idf scores are
created under two settings: (1) fitting tf-idf on both note categories combined, or (2) fitting tf-idf
separately on each note category. Unique features (unigrams) must occur in a minimum of 10% of
the documents and a maximum of 90% of the documents to be considered. Note, when we look at
combinations of note pairings we subset to patients that have both notes, so subsets of documents
are overlapping but not the exact same, resulting in different top features for the same category in
different note pairs.

J
Key Metrics from Semi-Synthetic Simulations

We report key metrics, mostly requiring access to the oracle U, for the semi-synthetic simulations in
the tables below. Although these metrics will typically not be available to practitioners at inference
time, they are helpful in understanding the relationship between the inferred proxies W and Z under
various conditions. The odds ratio values between the proxies and the oracle, γW U.C and γZU.C,
show how correlated the proxies are with the oracle, an important indicator for (P4). The difference
between 1 and the positivity rate of the oracle describes the minimum accuracy threshold for which
the inferred proxy must perform to be more accurate than simply predicting the majority class.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly state the claims and contributions made in the abstract and Section 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations of our work in Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

29


---Page Break---
Justification: We number all propositions and provide proofs in the main body of the paper.
More specifically, our assumptions are described in Section 2, and propositions and proofs
are described in Sections 3 and 4 of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We disclose all information needed to reproduce the fully synthetic and semi-
synthetic experiments in Sections C, D, E, F, and G of the Appendix. We also provide a link
to accompanying code in Section 1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide a link to all accompanying code for pre-processing the MIMIC-III
dataset and running our fully synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments in Section 1. To
reproduce our semi-synthetic results, one must also have access to the MIMIC-III dataset.
Once this dataset is acquired, we provide the scripts to process this data. Furthermore, Flan
and OLMo are publicly accessible from the Hugging Face library at https://huggingface.
co/.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Since our experiments use zero-shot classifiers, we only have inference data.
We explain which results use the oracle versus non-oracle. We provide precise details on
data splits and hyperparameters during odds ratio and average causal effect estimation using
the scikit-learn library in Appendix F.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide bootstrap confidence intervals in Figure 4 and 9 as well as in
Tables 1 and 2.

31


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide details of the compute resources in Section K of the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have reviewed the code of ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

32


---Page Break---
Justification: We discuss broader impacts in Section 6 of the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We credit the original creators of the datasets and models we use and mention
the licenses.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

33


---Page Break---
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The link to the accompanying code contains proper documentation and instruc-
tions for reproducing the results and figures shown in this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

34


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
