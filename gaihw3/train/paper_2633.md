Abstract

Recent advances in diffusion-based Large Restoration Models (LRMs) have sig-
nificantly improved photo-realistic image restoration by leveraging the internal
knowledge embedded within model weights. However, existing LRMs often suf-
fer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures
when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited
internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the
Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorpo-
rates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of
existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we
first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality
images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify
existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks
to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucina-
tion challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results.
Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.

Introduction

Restoring a high-quality image (HQ) from its low-quality counterpart (LQ) is a well-known ill-posed
problem and has been studied over the years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Previous efforts attempt to
handle this problem through employing various neural network architectures, including CNNs, GANs
and Transformers. Recently, diffusion models [10, 11] have emerged as a promising alternative,
delivering noteworthy results in real-world image restoration [12, 13, 14]. In particular, some
works [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] have successfully leveraged the powerful generative prior of pre-trained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for scaling up, to obtain the Large Restoration Model (LRM)
with billions of parameters, bringing significant progress in restoring photo-realistic images.

Although scaling up restoration models has achieved remarkable success, existing LRMs may not
always produce results that are faithful to the original scene, particularly when faced with heavily
degraded images that surpass the LRMs’ capabilities (see Fig. 1). This issue is similar to the
hallucination problem observed in large language models (LLMs) [21, 22], e.g. ChatGPT might
generate nonsense responses when highly specialized questions exceed its knowledge boundary.
Similarly, if one LRM has never seen a specific scene, it will struggle to restore corresponding images
faithfully. By analogizing LLM to LRM, we define the phenomenon where LRMs generate textures
inconsistent with the original scene when facing hard samples as the hallucination of LRMs.

To address the hallucination problem in LRMs, simply expanding the internal knowledge through
additional training data and parameters might seem straightforward, but it can significantly increase

computational and storage costs. Instead, this work considers another orthogonal strategy that
enhances the external knowledge of LRMs without adding parameter counts. Drawing inspiration
from the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) used in LLMs [23, 24, 25], we aim to use the
retrieved high-quality content-relevant images as external knowledge to alleviate the hallucination
of LRMs. However, applying RAG to image restoration poses specific challenges. Specifically, in
natural language, simply feeding the retrieved documents along with the original user query to LLMs
can allow it to produce grounded responses. However, in the context of image restoration, allowing
low-quality images to attend to retrieved images during their restoration process is non-trivial, which
motivates us to develop novel techniques to enable LRMs to utilize external knowledge in restoration.

To this end, we delve deep into the working mechanisms of LRMs for insightful observations. Details
of the experimental setup are described in Sec. 3. Our key findings indicate that the workflow of
LRMs can be divided into two distinct stages: the Denoising Structure Reconstruction stage, during
which the self-attention in the ControlNet [26] reconstructs a clear overall structure from the noised
representation. After that, in the Detail Texture Restoration stage, the self-attention in the UNet [27]
decoder fills scene-specific textures based on the denoised structure map. Based on these findings,
a natural solution emerged: we can transfer high-quality, scene-specific textures from the retrieved
images to the low-quality images during the detail texture restoration stage. In this way, the restored
image is allowed a consistent texture with the retrieved image, thus mitigating the hallucination.

Inspired by the above observation, in this work, we propose the Retrieval-augmented Framework
for Image Restoration, dubbed ReFIR, to offer a simple but effective way to expand the knowledge
boundary of LRMs using the external knowledge from the retrieved images. Specifically, we first
construct the retriever which employs the nearest neighbor lookup in the semantic embedding space
to retrieve content-relevant reference images in the high-quality image database. After that, we
develop the cross image injection which modifies the self-attention layer of original LRMs to enable
the queries from the low-quality denoising chain to attend to the keys and values from the denoising
chain of retrieved reference. To avoid the domain preference problem during injection, we propose
separate attention to perform intra-chain and inter-chain attention, respectively. Given the spatial
misalignment between the LQ and the retrieved HQ, we further adopt spatial adaptive gating to mask
meaningless pixels during injection. At last, we employ the distribution alignment to narrow the
domain gap between LQ and retrieved images. Thanks to the proposed ReFIR, the restoration of the
LQ image can make full use of the external knowledge from the reference to generate high-fidelity
images. Notably, the proposed pipeline is training-free and can be applied to multiple LRMs.

The contribution of this paper can be summarized as: (i) We introduce retrieval-augmented restoration,
a novel concept to mitigate the hallucination problems in existing LRMs. (ii) We conduct an in-
depth analysis of the working mechanisms of LRMs, based on which we propose a training-free
framework to utilize the retrieved images. (iii) Extensive experiments validate that our proposed
method effectively mitigates hallucination and is applicable to a broad spectrum of existing LRMs.

2.1
Diffusion Model for Image Restoration

Diffusion models have recently achieved significant advancements across various computer vision
tasks [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. In the realm of image restoration, early explorations
often involved training diffusion models from scratch to obtain the restoration tailored models [38,
39, 40, 41]. While these models are capable of producing high-fidelity results, they usually fall
short of generating perceptually pleasing images. To leverage the powerful generative capabilities
of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion [38], recent attempts [15,
16, 17, 42, 18, 19] have focused on using the ControlNet [43] with a LQ image as the condition to
generate HQ images. Benefiting from the scaling law [44], these large restoration models with billions
of parameters have shown impressive restoration results with photo-realistic textures and details.
However, similar to the large language models, when the user query, i.e., the LQ image in this setting,
exceeds the knowledge boundary of the large models, the models often fail to generate meaningful or
correct responses, which is unacceptable for image restoration tasks that pursue high-fidelity.

2.2
Reference-based Image Super-resolution

Compared with single image super-resolution [1, 4, 2, 3], Reference-based Image Super-Resolution
(RefSR) can achieve enhanced performance by employing content-similar reference images as the
additional input, and has attracted great research interests in the past few years [45, 46, 47]. For
instance, C2-Matching [47] introduces a teacher-student correlation distillation and a dynamic DCN
aggregation module for more precise alignment between low-quality and reference images. Following
this, DATSR [48] employs reciprocal learning and SwinTransformer to further boost performance.
Additionally, MRefSR [49] introduces a simple baseline to facilitate RefSR with multiple reference
images. It is worth mentioning that despite both using additional images as references, our proposed
retrieval augmented restoration pipeline differs from previous RefSR methods in several key aspects.
Firstly, current RefSR models are typically small-scale due to limited training data, leading to
performance degradation under challenging real-world conditions. Secondly, most RefSR methods
can only use one single reference image and even fail to work in the absence of reference images.
Thirdly, different from RefSR models that require training, our method can inject image-specific
external knowledge into LRMs in a training-free manner. We give a detailed discussion about the
difference in Appendix B.

2.3
Retrieval Augmented Generation

In the domain of natural language processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages
the strengths of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with knowledge retrieved
from an external document database to enhance the quality of generated content [21, 22]. Typically,
a RAG system initially retrieves documents relevant to the user’s query from the knowledge base
and then integrates the retrieved document along with the original user query into the LLMs without
any tuning to generate a response. Even when no relevant document is available, this system can
still operate by using the internal knowledge embedded in the LLMs’ parameters. The integration of
RAG allows LLMs to produce outputs that are not only contextually rich but also factually accurate,
effectively mitigating the hallucination problem in knowledge-intensive tasks [23, 24, 25]. In this

to alleviate the hallucination issues in LRMs. By utilizing external textures embedded in the retrieved
reference images, our tuning-free framework significantly facilitates faithful restoration results.

Probing Large Restoration Models

In order to manipulate the LRM so that it can utilize the retrieved reference images as external
knowledge, we first delve into the underlying mechanism of existing LRMs to find useful insights.
We choose the current popular LRM method SUPIR [19] as a representative. Inspired by previous
image editing efforts [50, 31, 30, 29], which show that the self-attention layer of diffusion models
contains important spatial correlation of an image, we thus follow this clue and employ the PCA
to visualize the principal components of the latent from self-attention layers of SUPIR. We further
utilize the Fourier analysis [51] to allow for quantitative results. The results are shown in Fig. 2.

It can be seen that the ControlNet of the LRM can denoise the latent as the layers deepen, facilitating
the reconstruction of a clear overall structure. However, this process is accompanied by a reduction
in the high-frequency meaningful texture of the original image. This qualitative visualization can be
also verified by the frequency characteristic plots, with high-frequency components decaying as layer
number increases. On the other hand, the role of the UNet decoder is significantly different. Based
on the previous clear structural map, the decoder restores the high-frequency details and textures
with the help of skip connections, which is also shown through the strengthening high-frequency
component in the decoder’s frequency curve.

Considering the above observations, we can divide the image restoration process of the LRM into
two phases: the Denosing Structure Reconstruction phase in the ControlNet, and the Detail Texture
Restoration phase in the UNet decoder. Inspired by these probing experiments, in this work, we
employ the detail texture restoration nature in the self-attention layer of the decoder to inject the
high-fidelity textures of retrieved images into the restoration process of the low-quality image.

Methodology

This work considers using retrieved reference images as an explicit part of the model. In contrast to
the existing restoration pipeline, our ReFIR is parameterized by not only the internal knowledge from
the network weights but also the external knowledge retrieved from suitable data representations.
Fig. 3 gives an overview of our ReFIR. In the following part, we will first give the technical details of
the retriever for reference image retrieval in Sec. 4.1, followed by the cross image injection to inject
the external data knowledge into the restoration process of LRMs in Sec. 4.2.

4.1
Nearest Neighbor Lookup for Reference Image Retrieval

Our reference image retrieval system can be represented as a binary set {D, R}, where D is a fixed
database containing a large number of HQ images, and R denotes a non-parametric retriever to
obtain the retrieved image set IR which consists of k elements and is a subset of D given a query LQ
image ILQ ∈R3×H×W , i.e., R : ILQ, D 7→IR, where IR ⊆D and |IR| = k. Ideally, R has to be

designed such that it provides the model with beneficial data representations from D to help restore
images containing details faithful to the original scenes.

In this work, we implement a conceptually simple solution of R, which uses the query image ILQ to
retrieve its k nearest neighbor in D using cosine similarity in the compact feature space derived from
any feature extractors, such as VGG [52], ResNet [53] or CLIP [54]. Since the D is fixed, in practice,
we can pre-extract and store the compact feature before training. Given a sufficiently large database
D, this strategy ensures that the set of neighbors IR shares sufficient semantic consistency with ILQ
and thus provides useful visual information for the restoration. Although this scheme seems simple,
we show that it is efficient and effective, please see Sec. 5.3 for discussion.

4.2
Cross Image Injection for High-fidelity Image Restoration

Given the retrieved reference images IR = R(ILQ, D), we further propose the cross image injection
to allow the original LRMs to use the external knowledge from IR. As shown in Fig. 4, we first
construct two parallel denoising chains: the target restoration chain CT which is used to restore
ILQ, and the source reference chain CS which unfolds IR into denoising time steps. After that, we
introduce separate attention to separately perform attention within and between chains, followed by
spatial adaptive gating to filter out irrelevant pixels. At last, we use the distribution alignment to
mitigate the domain gap between chains. More details are given below.

Separate attention. To allow the CT to learn the knowledge from the CS, an effective interaction
between the latents is crucial. Inspired by the observation in Sec. 3, we aim to transfer the knowledge
embedded in the self-attention layer of CS’s decoder to the counterpart of CT . To this end, we modify
the original self-attention in CT to our proposed separate attention. The core idea of our separate
attention is to add “inter-chain cross-attention” to the original “intra-chain self-attention” so that CT
can attend high-quality texture knowledge from CS while preserving its original features. As shown
in Fig. 4(a), formally, denote QT , KT , VT as the query, key and value from the CT , and KS, VS as
the key and value from the CS, the intra-chain self-attention preserves the original attention of CT to
obtain the output Ointra, and the inter-chain cross-attention uses the QT to query the KS and VS to
facilitate CT utilizing the knowledge from CS to get the result Ointer. In short, the proposed separate
attention can be formalized as follows:

Ointra = Attention(QT , KT , VT ),
Ointer = Attention(QT , KS, VS).
(1)

It is worth mentioning that directly using QT to query the concatenate results of KT and KS can
only yield sub-optimal results due to the domain preference issue, i.e., QT will prefer latent from the
same domain CT even though CS is more helpful for reconstruction. By using the proposed separate
attention, the QT is separated to attend KT and KS, thus effectively mitigating this problem. We
give more discussion in Sec. 5.3.

Spatial adaptive gating. We then consider fusing the separate attention results Ointra and Ointer.
The main challenge is the spatial misalignment between ILQ and IR. For instance, the same objects

5


---Page Break---
may appear in different locations in ILQ and IR, or some objects in ILQ may not present in IR and
vice versa. As a result, some pixels in QT may not find the corresponding reference in KS, resulting
in some pixels in Ointer meaningless.

To address this spatial misalignment, we propose the spatial adaptive gating to selectively fuse Ointra
and Ointer without introducing additional parameters (Fig. 4(b)). Specifically, given latents at specific
denoising blocks from CT and CS, respectively, we first flatten them along the spatial dimension
to obtain hT, hS ∈RC×HW . Next, we compute their pixel-wise cosine similarity to obtain the
similarity matrix sim ∈RHW ×HW . Since the i-th row of sim represents the similarity of the i-th
pixel in hT to all the pixels in hS, therefore, a large sum of the i-th row indicates a large impact of
hS in restoring the i-th pixel of hT. Following this idea, we summation over the i-th row of the sim
to approximate the utility of hS to the i-th pixel of hT. Finally, we reshape this summation results
back to 2D shape and use min-max normalization to restrict the range to [0, 1], to get the pixel-wise
mask M for adaptive gated fusion:
Ofuse = (1 −sM) ⊗Ointra + sM ⊗Ointer,
(2)
where s is a user-defined scalar to control the degree to which the restored image attends the retrieved
images, ⊗denotes the Hardamard product, and 1 is an all one tensor with the same shape as M.

Distribution alignment. Using the Ofuse to replace the original intra-chain self-attention results
Ointra seems to be a promising way to integrate useful external knowledge from CS. However, it
should be noticed that there is a domain gap between CT and CS due to the image quality and content
differences, and thus a direct insertion of Ointra into CT will result in a distribution shift of the
original denoising chain in CT .

To this end, we propose the distribution alignment as a complementary to calibrate the distribution
shift. Specifically, considering the latent in the diffusion chain is a Gaussian, we propose to use
the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) [55] to align the mean and variance of Ofuse to the
original statistics of Ointra:
O′
fuse = AdaIN(Ofuse, Ointra),
(3)
where AdaIN(u, v) denotes replacing the mean and variance of u with the corresponding part of v.
Finally, we replace the original self-attention result in CT with the well-aligned O′
fuse to finish the
cross image injection process.

Experiments

5.1
Experiments Setup

Datasets and metrics. In this work, we include experiments with two difficulty levels for performance
evaluation. The first setup considers restoration with manually provided ideal reference images,
which share a high content similarity with the LQ image, to evaluate the ability to utilize the
reference knowledge. The datasets for this setting employ the widely used RefSR dataset including
CUFED5 [56, 57] and WR-SR [47], in which the reference images are already provided. Since
these datasets only contain HQ images, we thus use the second-order degradation model from
Real-ESRGAN [8] with ×4 down-sampling scale to generate the real-world degraded images. The
second setup turns to more challenging practice where the reference images have to be retrieved
using the retriever, and we use the RealPhoto60 [19] which contains 60 real-world degraded images
without ground truth for evaluation. And we use DIV2K [58] as the high-quality image database for
retrieval and employ the image encoder of VGG16 [52] as the feature extractor. As for the evaluation
metrics, we use both the fidelity metrics containing PSNR and SSIM, as well as the perceptual
metrics including LPIPS [59], NIQE [60], FID [61], MUISQ [62], and CLIPIQA [63], to assess the
performance of the different methods.

Implementation details. For a fair comparison, we use one reference image if not specified.
Experiments with multiple reference images are given in Appendix A. Following the common practice
of existing LRMs [19, 17, 18, 16], the ILQ is up-sampled to the desired size using Bicubic before
going through the LRMs. We use reflective padding to ensure the input size of CT and CS are the
same. We use fixed random seeds for results reproducibility in all experiments. The hyperparameters
of different baselines follow their original settings. We apply the proposed retrieval augmented
restoration framework to two popular LRMs, namely SeeSR [18] and SUPIR [19], and denoted the
models augmented with our ReFIR as “SeeSR+ReFIR” and “SUPIR+ReFIR”, respectively.

Comparison to State-of-the-Arts

Restoration with ideal reference. We first compare on the RefSR dataset with real-world degradation.
The compared methods includes state-of-the-art RefSR methods [47, 48, 49], GAN-based methods [9,
8], and recent Diffusion-based methods [16, 19, 18, 17, 15]. Tab. 1 gives the results. It can be seen
that our method brings significant gains in all metrics on both fidelity (PSNR, SSIM) and perceptual
quality (LPIPS, NIQE, FID) for the LRMs. Taking SUPIR as an example, our method brings a
FID improvement of even 19.57 on the CUFED5 dataset. Moreover, similar performance gains
can also be observed in SeeSR. For instance, equipping our ReFIR to SeeSR can lead to 0.38dB
PSNR improvement, demonstrating the generalization of our ReFIR. It is noteworthy that the above
superiority is obtained without any training or fine-tuning. Moreover, we also give visual comparisons
in Fig. 5, and it can be seen that our method can generate details that are faithful to the original scene
with the help of external knowledge from retrieved reference images.

Restoration in the wild. The above experiments on RefSR datasets focus on utilizing the already
provided reference images from the dataset, which applies when the user has relevant HQ images. In
this section, we turn to more challenging scenarios in which the reference image has to be obtained
by retrieval. Since the ground truth of RealPhoto datasets is unavailable, we use non-reference image
quality assessment metrics, i.e. NIQE, MUSIQ, and CLIPIQA for evaluation. As shown in Tab. 2, our
approach continues to produce significant gains over its non-ReFIR counterparts. For instance, our
SeeSR+ReFIR surpasses the original SeeSR by 0.2866 NIQE and 1.59 MUSIQ. Since the retrieved
image can not serve as an ideal reference, the above favorable results demonstrate the robustness of
our ReFIR in the face of real-world retrieved images. We also give quantitative results in Fig. 6. Even
under severe real-world degradation, our method maintains good perceptual quality.

Complexity analysis. Tab. 3 gives the comparison of the computational complexity, including the
number of parameters, GPU cost, and the inference latency. We also give the restoration performance
for a more comprehensive comparison. As for the parameters, our ReFIR can facilitate both fidelity
and realistic image restoration using the same #param as the original base LRMs. For the GPU
memory, since our ReFIR uses two images as input, i.e., one LQ image, and one reference image, the
GPU cost will become larger than the original one. For instance, it rises 1.38 times the increase of
SUPIR+ReFIR than the original SUPIR model. Moreover, the inference time also increases due to
more inputs as well as the additional interaction between two chains. In the future, we will delve
deep into the effective utilization of retrieved images while maintaining efficiency.

Ablation Studies

Effectiveness of the reference retriever. In order to obtain content-relevant retrieved images, we
present a simple but inference-efficient retriever R that uses the high-level semantic vectors from
the pre-trained deep models for similarity matching in the high-quality image dataset D. Despite the
simple design, we here demonstrate its effectiveness in Fig. 7. Since semantically consistent images
usually contain similar textures, e.g., the texture in the first elephant image can help in the restoration
of the LQ elephant image, and thus the proposed retriever can yield satisfactory retrieval results.
Although texture-based retrieval may be a better choice for image restoration, it usually necessitates
additional training of new retrieval models. For simplicity, we adopt semantic-based retrieval and
leave the exploration of more advanced reference retrievers for future work.

Ablation on cross image injection. In the proposed cross image injection, we use separate at-
tention (SA), spatial adaptive gating (SG), and distribution alignment (DA) for effective external
knowledge injection. Here, we ablate to validate the effectiveness of different components. We
use SUPIR+ReFIR as a representative on the CUFED5 dataset and use the scalar weighted sum
when SG is removed. The results are shown in Tab. 4. One can see that using fixed scalar weights
instead of spatial adaptive gating results in a 0.18 NIQE drop. This is because not all pixels of
the reference image are useful, and thus fine-grain gated mask is needed. Moreover, removing the
distribution alignment also impairs performance, e.g., 4.36 FID drop, since the distribution of raw
fusion results Ofuse does not match CT , and directly inject Ofuse to the denoising chain of CT can
cause sub-optimal results.

Domain preference problem.
The motivation behind the
proposed separate attention is to address the domain preference
problem, i.e., the attention in CT will prefer to use latent from
the same chain even though the latent from CS is more help-
ful for reconstruction. To verify the existence of the domain
preference, we use the ground truth IHR as the input of CS and
compute the normalized attention scores between QT and KT ,
QT and KS. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that even using the spatially
strictly aligned IHQ as the reference, QT still has significantly
high attention for the latent from the same chain, indicating
that the domain preference problem interferes with the CT ’s
utilization of external knowledge in CS. By contrast, the proposed separate attention can effectively
mitigate this problem by forcing the QT to separately attend KT and KS.

Other choices on injection position. In Sec. 3, we find the diffusion decoder is responsible for
restoring textures. Based on this observation we propose to apply cross-image injection on the UNet
decoder. Here, we ablate to analyze the impact of different cross-image injection positions. The
results are shown in Tab. 5. It can be seen that performing cross-image injection only on the encoder
will cause 19.57 FID drops. This is because the encoder focuses on the structure reconstruction, thus
transferring the structure of CS will destroy the layout of the CT . Moreover, performing injection
only in the decoder achieves the best results since it can transfer the high-quality textures from the
CS. Due to the page limit, more ablation experiments can be seen in Appendix C.

Discussions

What is the impact of the control scale? The scale s in Eq. (2) can control the extent to which the
LRMs use external knowledge from the retrieved reference image for restoration. Here, we conduct
an ablation study to explore the effect of s. The results are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that
when s takes smaller values, the model mainly uses the internal knowledge embedded in its own
parameters, which can make the model hallucinate when the degradation is severe. For example,
the model produces incorrect textures when s = 0. As s increases, the model starts to use external
knowledge from the retrieved reference image, from which the model’s hallucination problem can be
alleviated. We also provide quantitative ablation experiments on s in Appendix C.

How much do the reference images affect performance? In the proposed framework, the retrieved
images IR is crucial in alleviating hallucinations. Here, we try to answer the role of IR during
restoration process, by manually controlling different types of retrieved images. As shown in Tab. 6,

we find that using the exact ground truth IHQ as the IR can further improve the performance, which
can be seen as an ideal up-bound. Interestingly, using ILQ itself as its own retrieved image instead
brings a slight improvement compared with no retrieval, which we attribute to the regularization
effect from the distribution alignment strategy. Finally, randomly selecting a high-quality reference
image even resulted in a huge performance degradation, suggesting that the content correlation is
more important than the image quality for a favorable retrieved reference image.

How does the proposed ReFIR work? Extensive experiments have shown the state-of-the-art
performance of our ReFIR. However, it seems not straightforward to understand how the retrieved
reference images influence the image restoration process of the original LRMs. Here, we give an
intuitive explanation. As shown in Fig. 10, for the latent at the t-th time step on the latent manifold,
there are two forces in different directions pulling it to produce the latent at the next t −1-th time
step. One force is from the internal knowledge of frozen weights in LRMs, and the other is the
external knowledge from the retrieved reference image through the proposed cross image injection
mechanism. These two forces ultimately determine the latent of the next time step. Therefore, a
restored image from our ReFIR can utilize both the internal knowledge in the original LRMs as well
as the external knowledge in the retrieved image, thus alleviating the hallucination of the LRMs.

Conclusion

This paper presents ReFIR, a training-free and generic framework that can alleviate the halluci-
nation of LRMs to facilitate high-fidelity and photo-realistic restoration results through retrieval
augmentation. We introduce the nearest neighbor lookup as a simple retriever to obtain relevant
high-quality images and further propose the cross-image injection which employs separate attention
to transfer knowledge while avoiding the domain preference problem, the spatial adaptive gating to
address the spatial misalignment, and the distribution alignment to mitigate the domain gap during
injection. Through expanding the knowledge boundary using the additional external knowledge
from retrieved images, our ReFIR exhibits significant improvements on both fidelity and perceptual
quality, as demonstrated through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, with
its training-free and generic nature, our ReFIR can be easily applied to multiple LRMs.

A
Adaptive Multi-reference Injection

Technical details. In the main paper, we mainly focus on the case of one single retrieved image.
However, in practice, there may be multiple available reference images at hand, and using multi-
ple reference images for resemblance could intuitively gain better performance. To this end, we
extend the original cross-image injection to allow to incorporation of multiple reference images for
reconstruction. Our key idea is to modify the scale factor s in Eq. (2) from a scalar into a vector:
s = {s1, s2, · · · , sk}, where P sn = 1. Each sn can be obtained by computing the cosine similarity
between ILQ and the corresponding n-th retrieved image in IR followed by Softmax normalization.
Then we can modify the original single-reference cross-image injection of Eq. (2) to the following
multi-reference version:

Ofuse = (1 −

k
X

n=1
snMn) ⊗Ointer + (

k
X

n=1
snMn) ⊗Ointra,
(4)

where Mn denotes the gated mask of the n-th reference image.

Experiments with multiple reference images. For experiments with multiple reference images,
we use SUPIR+ReFIR as a representative. Since the CUFED5 dataset contains multiple reference
images, we directly use the provided images as the retrieved reference for reproducibility. Tab. 8
gives the results. It can be seen that using multiple reference images produces better results than
one single reference image, e.g. the 2.08 improvement in FID. However, it is worth noting that the
marginal gain from adding reference images is diminishing, accompanied by a notable increase in
computational cost. Therefore, in practice, we use one single reference image to balance the model
performance and inference efficiency.

More Discussions

Difference from the other methods. Our ReFIR uses retrieved images as the reference for high-
fidelity restoration. Despite both RefSR methods and ours appears the reference image, we would
like to clarify the difference between our ReFIR and previous RefSR methods. Firstly, current RefSR
models [47, 48, 49] are typically small-scale (#param <50M) and use simple Bicubic degradation,
while our ReFIR focuses on the recent diffusion-based large-scale restoration model (#param >1B)
for more challenging real-world SR. Secondly, most RefSR methods can only use one reference
image and even fail to work in the absence of reference images, by contrast, our ReFIR can flexibly
use 0 ∼k images. Thirdly, different from RefSR models that require training, our method can be
applied in various LRMs in a training-free manner.

Performance under extreme conditions. Since our Re-
FIR relies on the retrieved images, it is interesting to ex-
plore extreme situations when highly relevant and high-
quality reference images are scarce or even unavailable. To
this end, we introduce the fallback strategies to handle this
situation. Specifically, since our method does not modify
the parameters of LRMs, we can directly use the original
inference pipeline of the LRM without using reference
images. We denote this as origin_lrm. In addition, we
also use the BLIP model to caption the LR image to obtain
the text prompt, which will then be fed into the StableDiffusion2.0 model to generate semantic-similar
high-quality images as the reference. We denote this as gen_ref. We use SeeSR [18] as a represen-
tative, on the real-world degradation dataset RealPhoto60 [19]. We first give the results in which
all LR images adopt the fallback strategies in Tab. 7. It can be seen that using the SD2.0 generated
images as the fallback image can bring slightly improvement compared with noReference. After
that, we further develop task-oriented adaptive strategies to enhance the performance of ReFIR in
real-world scenarios. In detial, we respectively use the retrieved images and the gen_ref to generate
the results. And then we select the one with a larger task score as the final result. We denote it
as ada_gen_ref. From Tab. 7, it can be seen that the task-oriented strategy achieves a significant

performance improvement against previous ReFIR baselines, e.g., 0.0183 CLIPIQA improvements,
due to the fact that it works in the output end. However, this setup is accompanied by a larger
inference time, and further acceleration on this fallback strategies can be an promising future work.

Computational overhead from retrieval and attention modification. Since we employ additional
Ref images as input and modify the attention layers, we adiscuss the impact of these trchnuques on the
inferenve efficiency. First, in order to reduce the computational overhead of the retrieval process, we
pre-calculated the feature vectors of all images in the retrieval database before inference. Furthermore,
the cosine similarity between the LR image vectors and all retrieval vectors is computed in parallel.
These strategy results in an almost negligible (less than 3% inference time) cost of computational
overhead. Second, the modification of self-attention layers only happens in the last 20 timestep in
the decoder layers, i.e., only 12% attention layers are modified while the left is kept intact. These
analysis is also supported by practice, in which we find these two process only take up <5% inference
time, with most computational cost coming from the original LRM. Future LRM acceleration (e.g.
pruning, quantization, one-step diffusion) will benefit our ReFIR, and we will explore more efficient
implementation in the future.

Why use the self-attention as the external knowledge? In the proposed cross-image injection, we
use the features of the self-attention layer of the CS’s decoder as external knowledge to guide CT to
produce textures faithful to the original scene. Here, we give the reason behind this. Firstly, previous
image-to-image efforts [29, 31, 30, 50], e.g., image editing, has demonstrated through extensive
experiments that the self-attention layer of the diffusion model contains important spatial correlations
in images, which inspired us to follow this clue to utilize this prior. Secondly, leveraging the attention
mechanism allows CT to query features in CS without any training, whereas using features from other
parts of CS may require introducing additional training.

What about the quality of cross-image attention? In the proposed cross-image injection, the
inter-chain attention is used to perform attention between QT and KS. Considering the domain
gap between CT and CS due to the input quality difference, one may ask whether the results of the
inter-chain attention are meaningful. Here, We visualize the attention map to validate the effectiveness
of the inter-chain attention (see Fig. 13). It can be seen that for a given query pixel query in CT ,

16

the inter-chain attention can effectively overcome the spatial misalignment, and find relevant pixel
features in CS for reference.

C
More Ablation Results

Quantitative ablation on the control scale.
We also provide quantitative ablation results on
the control scale s in Fig. 11. It can be seen that when s is too small, the LRM will mainly use
the knowledge contained within its parameters to restore high-quality images, which can lead to
performance degradation due to the hallucination problem. On the other hand, when s is too large,
the LRM will overuse the content in the retrieved reference image, thus producing patterns that are
not present in the original LQ image. In practice, we adopt a moderate s = 0.5 to trade off the
hallucination and the overuse of the reference image.

Other choices for cross image injection. The proposed
cross image injection mitigates the domain preference
problem by using separate attention to promote latent in
CT to attend CS. Here, we conduct ablation to study the
impact of different design choices of cross image injection.
As shown in Tab. 9, directly replacing the original self-
attention results from Ointra in CT with corresponding
latent in CS causes severe performance degradation, due
to the significant loss of original knowledge in CT . In
addition, using QT to query the concatenation results of KT and KS also causes a performance drop,
which further confirms that the domain preference problem, i.e., QT prefers to use latent from the
same chain CT , even though CS is more helpful for reconstruction.

D
Statistical Significance on Performance

In Tab. 1 of the main paper, we give the performance gains of incorporating the proposed ReFIR into
the existing LRMs. Considering the randomness of the generative models, we give the performance
fluctuations of ReFIR under multiple trials with exactly the same experimental setting and random
seed. The results are given in Tab. 10. It can be seen that the randomness of the diffusion-based
generative model is very small when using a fixed seed, reducing the disturbance from noise errors
for evaluation. In addition, we further use hypothesis testing to verify the significance of performance
gains, and the test results reject the original hypothesis H0 at 95% confidence level on all metrics and
datasets, indicating that the performance gains from the proposed method are statistically significant.

E
Extension to Specific Restoration Scenarios

An important application of our method is in scenarios with high fidelity demands, such as scene
text images with a specific stylistic structure, or face images with identity preservation, and here we
preliminarily explore the application of the proposed ReFIR to real-world face image restoration. The
results are given in Fig. 15. It can be seen that by using a high quality image of a specific person’s
identity as a reference, the resulting restoration results can better preserve the person’s attributes.
However, it should be noted that this experiment is just a preliminary attempt, and we will leave the
further improvement of our ReFIR for specific downstream restoration tasks for future work.

F
Limitation and Future Works

Although the proposed ReFIR can effectively mitigate the hallucination of LRMs by introducing
external knowledge from retrieved reference images, the proposed framework can be further improved
in the following aspects. First, since the computational complexity of the current LRMs is costly, the
computational complexity will be further increased when using the proposed method, which may
hinder the use of resource-constrained mobile devices. With the advent of accelerated diffusion-based
image restoration methods in the future, we believe that the proposed method can further improve
its efficiency. In addition, this paper proposes a simple retriever based on semantic vector matching
for presentation. With the development of image retrieval techniques [64, 65], designing specialized

retrievers, e.g., using textures as key matching cues, will further improve the performance. Finally,
for some slightly degraded images, which can already be handled well by only using the internal
knowledge of the LRMs, designing hyper-networks to adaptively decide whether to use retrieval
augmentation or not is also promising. We leave the above considerations for future work.

G
Broader Impact

The development of our ReFIR offers significant positive societal impacts, including advancements
in medical imaging, historical preservation, and media restoration by enhancing the fidelity and
realism of image restoration. However, it also poses potential negative societal impacts, such as the
misuse of improved restoration capabilities for generating disinformation, deepfakes, and surveillance,
raising ethical concerns about privacy, security, and fairness. To mitigate these risks, implementing
safeguards like gated releases of models, monitoring mechanisms, and transparency in model training
and deployment is crucial. Continuous ethical evaluation and adherence to strict guidelines are
essential to prevent potential harms.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have clearly outlined the main contributions of this paper in the abstract
and introduction sections.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed in detail the limitation of this work in Appendix F.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: All assumptions in the paper are either derived from the conclusions of previous
research or validated through extensive experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided a detailed description of our algorithm’s process and
implementation specifics in the paper, and we will release our code after review.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

24


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We will release our code after review, but we have already provided a detailed
explanation of how to implement our algorithm and the specific implementation details in
the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided detailed experimental details in both the paper and the
appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the performance fluctuation under different random seeds
in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provided the computational resources we used for experiments in the ??.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have checked in every respect that this work conform with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided detailed discussion on possible both positive and negative
societal impact in Appendix G.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

26


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the creators and original owners of assets used in this paper are prop-
erly credited, and the license and terms of use are explicitly mentioned and respected, as
evidenced by thorough citations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
