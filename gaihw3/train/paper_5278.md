Abstract

This paper introduces a novel prior called Diversiﬁed Block Sparse Prior to charac-
terize the widespread block sparsity phenomenon in real-world data. By allowing
diversiﬁcation on intra-block variance and inter-block correlation matrices, we
effectively address the sensitivity issue of existing block sparse learning methods
to pre-deﬁned block information, which enables adaptive block estimation while
mitigating the risk of overﬁtting. Based on this, a diversiﬁed block sparse Bayesian
learning method (DivSBL) is proposed, utilizing EM algorithm and dual ascent
method for hyperparameter estimation. Moreover, we establish the global and local
optimality theory of our model. Experiments validate the advantages of DivSBL
over existing algorithms.

Introduction

Sparse recovery through Compressed Sensing (CS), with its powerful theoretical foundation and
broad practical applications, has received much attention [1]. The basic model is considered as
y = Φx,
(1)

where y ∈RM×1 is the measurement (or response) vector and Φ ∈RM×N is a known design matrix,
satisfying the Unique Representation Property (URP) condition [2]. x ∈RN×1(N ≫M) is the
sparse vector to be recovered. In practice, x often exhibits transform sparsity, becoming sparse in a
transform domain such as Wavelet, Fourier, etc. Once the signal is compressible in a linear basis Ψ,
in other words, x = Ψw where w exhibits sparsity, and ΦΨ satisﬁes Restricted Isometry Constants
(RIP) [3], then we can simply replace x by Ψw in (1) and solve it in the same way. Classic algorithms
for compressive sensing and sparse regression include Lasso [4], Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL)
[5], Basis Pursuit (BP) [6], Orthogonal Matching Pursuit(OMP) [7], etc. Recently, there have been
approaches that involve solving CS problems through deep learning [8; 9; 10].

However, deeper research into sparse learning has shown that relying solely on the sparsity of x is
insufﬁcient, especially with limited samples [11; 12]. Widely encountered real-world data, such as
image and audio, often exhibit clustered sparsity in transformed domains [13]. This phenomenon,
known as block sparsity, means the sparse non-zero entries of x appear in blocks [11]. Recent
years, block sparse models have gained attention in machine learning, including sparse training [14],
adversarial learning [15], image restoration [16; 14], (audio) signal processing [17; 18] and many
other areas. Generally, the block structure of x with g blocks is deﬁned by

x = [x1 . . . xd1

{z

xT

xd1+1 . . . xd1+d2

· · · xN−dg+1 . . . xN

(2)

where di(i = 1...g) represent the size of each block, which are not necessarily identical. Suppose
only k(k ≪g) blocks are non-zero, indicating that x is block sparse. Up to now, several methods
have been proposed to recover block sparse signals. They are mainly divided into two categories.

Block-based
Classical algorithms for processing block sparse scenarios include Group-Lasso
[19; 20; 21], Group Basis Pursuit [22], Block-OMP [11]. Blocks are assumed to be static with a ﬁxed
preset size. Furthermore, Temporally-SBL (TSBL) [23] and Block-SBL (BSBL) [24; 25], based on
Bayesian models, provide reﬁned estimation of correlation matrices within blocks. However, they
assume elements within one block tend to be either zero or non-zero simultaneously. Although they
can estimate intra-block correlation with high accuracy in block-level recovery, they require preset
choices of suitable block sizes and patterns, which are too rigid for many practical applications.

Pattern-based
StructOMP [26] is a pattern-based greedy algorithm allowing structures, which is
a generalization of group sparsity. Another classic model named Pattern-Coupled SBL (PC-SBL)
[27; 28], does not have a predeﬁned requirement for block size as well. It utilizes a Bayesian model to
couple the signal variances. Building upon PC-SBL, Burst PC-SBL, proposed in [29], is employed for
the estimation of mMIMO channels. While pattern-based algorithms address the issue of explicitly
specifying block patterns in block-based algorithms, these models provide a coarse characterization
of the intra-block correlation, leading to a loss of structural information within the blocks.

In this paper, we introduce a diversiﬁed block sparse Bayesian framework that incorporates diversity
in both variance within the same block and intra-block correlation among different blocks. Our model
not only inherits the advantages of block-based methods on block-level estimation, but also addresses
the longstanding issues associated with such algorithms: the diversiﬁed scheme reduces sensitivity to
a predeﬁned block size or speciﬁed block location, hence accommodates general block sparse data.
Based on this model, we develop the DivSBL algorithm, and also analyze both the global minimum
and local minima of the constrained cost function (likelihood). The subsequent experiments illustrate
the superiority of proposed diversiﬁed scheme when applied to real-life block sparse data.

Diversiﬁed block sparse Bayesian model

We consider the block sparse signal recovery, or compressive sensing question in the noisy case

y = Φx + n,
(3)

where n ∼N(0, β−1I) represents the measurement noise, and β is the precise scalar. Other symbols
have the same interpretations as (1). The signal x exhibits block-sparse structure in (2), yet the block
partition is unknown. For clarity in description, we assume that all blocks have equal size L, with the
total dimension denoted as N = gL. Henceforth, we presume that the signal x follows the structure:

x = [x11 . . . x1L
|
{z
}
xT
1

x21 . . . x2L
|
{z
}
xT
2

· · · xg1 . . . xgL
|
{z
}
xT
g

]T .

In Sections 2.1.1 and 5.2, we clarify that this assumption is made without loss of generality. In fact,
our algorithm can automatically adjust L to an appropriate size, expanding or contracting as needed.

2.1
Diversiﬁed block sparse prior
The Diversiﬁed Block Sparse prior is proposed in the following scheme. Each block xi ∈RL×1 is
assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian prior

p (xi; {Gi, Bi}) = N (0, GiBiGi) , ∀i = 1, · · · , g,
(5)

in which, Gi represents the Diversiﬁed Variance matrix, and Bi represents the Diversiﬁed Correlation
matrix, with detailed formulations in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. Therefore, the prior distribution of the
entire signal x is denoted as

p (x; {Gi, Bi}g
i=1) = N (0, Σ0) ,
(6)

where Σ0 = diag {G1B1G1, G2B2G2, · · · , GgBgGg}. The dependency in this hierarchical
model is shown in Figure.1.

2.1.1
Diversiﬁed intra-block variance
We ﬁrst execute diversiﬁcation on variance. In (5), Gi is deﬁned as

Gi ≜diag{√γi1, · · · , √γiL},
(7)

and Bi ∈RL×L is a positive deﬁnite matrix capturing the correlation within the i-th block. According
to the deﬁnition of Pearson correlation, the covariance term GiBiGi in (5) can be speciﬁed as

where ρi

ements in correlation matrix Bi, serv-
ing as a visualization of covariance
with displayed structural information.

Now it is evident why assuming equal block sizes L is insensitive. For the sake of clarity, we denote
the true size of the i-th block xi as Li
T . As illustrated in Figure 2, when the true block falls within
the preset block, the variances γi· corresponding to the non-zero positions in xi will be learned as
non-zero values through posterior inference, while the variances at zero positions will automatically
be learned as zero. When the true block is positioned across the preset block, several blocks of the
predeﬁned size L covered by the actual block will be updated together, and likewise, variances will
be learned as either zero or non-zero. In this way, both of the size and location of the blocks will be
automatically learned through posterior inference on the variances.

2.1.2
Diversiﬁed inter-block correlation
Due to limited data and excessive parameters in intra-block correlation matrices Bi(∀i), previous
works correct their estimation by imposing strong correlated constraints Bi = B(∀i) to overcome
overﬁtting [24]. Recognizing that correlation matrices among different blocks should be diverse yet
still exhibit some correlation, we apply a weak-correlated constraint to diversify Bi in the model.

Here we introduce novel weak constraints on Bi, speciﬁcally,

ψ (Bi) = ψ (B)
∀i = 1, · · · , g,
(8)

where ψ : RL2 →R is the weak constraint function and B is obtained from the strong constraints
Bi = B(∀i), as detailed in Section 3.2. Weak constraints (8) not only capture the distinct correlation
structure but also avoid overﬁtting issue arising from the complete independence among different Bi.

Furthermore, the constraints imposed here not only maintain the global minimum property of our
algorithm, as substantiated in Section 4, but also effectively enhance the convergence rate of the
algorithm. There are actually gL(L+1)/2 constraints in the strong correlated constraints Bi = B(∀i),
while with (8), the number of constraints signiﬁcantly decreases to g, yielding acceleration on the
convergence rate. The experimental result is shown in Appendix A.

In summary, the prior based on (5), (6), (7) and (8) is deﬁned as diversiﬁed block sparse prior.

2.1.3
Connections to classical models
Note that the classical Sparse Bayesian Learning models, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [5] and
Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) [23], are special cases of our model.

---Page Break---
Connection to RVM
Taking Bi as identity matrix, diversiﬁed block sparse prior (6) immediately
degenerates to RVM model

p (xi; γi) = N (0, γi) , ∀i = 1, · · · , N,
(9)

which means ignoring the correlation structure.

Connection to BSBL
When Gi is scalar matrix √γiI, the formulation (5) becomes

p (xi; {γi, Bi}) = N (0, γiBi) , ∀i = 1, · · · , g,
(10)

which is exactly BSBL model. In this case, all elements within a block share common variance γi.

2.2
Posterior estimation
By observation model (3), the Gaussian likelihood is

p(y | x; β) = N(Φx, β−1I).
(11)

With prior (6) and likelihood (11), the diversiﬁed block sparse posterior distribution of x can be
derived based on Bayes’ theorem as

p (x | y; {Gi, Bi}g
i=1 , β) = N (µ, Σ) ,
(12)

where

µ = βΣΦT y,
(13)

Σ =

Σ−1

(14)

After estimating all hyperparameters in (12), i.e, ˆΘ =
n
{ ˆGi}g
i=1, { ˆBi}g
i=1, ˆβ
o
, as described in
Section 3, the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation of x is formulated as

ˆxMAP = ˆµ.
(15)

Bayesian inference: DivSBL algorithm

3.1
EM formulation

To estimate Θ = {{Gi}g
i=1, {Bi}g
i=1, β}, either Type-II Maximum Likelihood [30] or Expectation-
Maximization (EM) formulation [31] can be employed. Following EM procedure, our goal is to
maximize p(y; Θ), or equivalently log p(y; Θ). Deﬁning objective function as L(Θ), the problem
can be expressed as
max
Θ
L(Θ) = −yT Σ−1
y y −log det Σy,
(16)

where Σy = β−1I + ΦΣ0ΦT . Then, treating x as hidden variable in E-step, we have Q function as

Q(Θ) =Ex|y;Θt−1[log p(y, x; Θ)]

=Ex|y;Θt−1[log p(y | x; β)] + Ex|y;Θt−1 [log p (x; {Gi}g
i=1, {Bi}g
i=1)]

≜Q(β) + Q({Gi}g
i=1, {Bi}g
i=1),
(17)

where Θt−1 denotes the parameter estimated in the latest iteration. As indicated in (17), we have
divided Q function into two parts: Q(β) ≜Ex|y;Θt−1[log p(y | x; β)] depends solely on β, and
Q({Gi}g
i=1, {Bi}g
i=1) ≜Ex|y;Θt−1 [log p (x; {Gi}g
i=1, {Bi}g
i=1)] only on {Gi}g
i=1 and {Bi}g
i=1.
Therefore, the parameters of these two Q functions can be updated separately.

In M-step, we need to maximize the above Q functions to obtain the estimation of Θ. As shown in
Appendix B, the updating formula for γij, Bi can be obtained as follows2:

γij =

Diversiﬁed correlation matrices by dual ascent
Now we propose the algorithm for solving the correlation matrix estimation problem satisfying (8).
As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, previous studies have employed strong constraints Bi = B(∀i), i.e.,

In diversiﬁed scheme, we apply weak-correlated constraints (8) to diversify Bi. Therefore, the
problem of maximizing the Q function with respect to Bi becomes

s. t.
ψ (Bi) = ψ (B)
∀i = 1, · · · , g,
(P)

where B is already derived in (21). Therefore, by solving (P) , we will obtain diversiﬁed solution
for correlation matrices Bi, ∀i. The constraint function ψ can be further categorized into two cases:
explicit constraints and hidden constraints.

Explicit constraints with complete dual ascent
Explicit functions such as the Frobenius norm, the
logarithm of the determinant, etc., are good choices for ψ. An efﬁcient way to solve this constrained
optimization is to solve its dual problem (mostly refers to Lagrange dual [32]). Choosing ψ(·) as
log det(·), the detailed solution process is outlined in Appendix C. And the update formulas for Bi
and multiplier λi (dual variable) are given by

i (log det Bk
i −log det B),
(24)

in which αk
i represents the step size in the k-th iteration for updating the multiplier λi (i = 1, · · · , g).
Convergence is only guaranteed if the step size satisﬁes P∞
k=1 αk
i = ∞and P∞
k=1(αk
i )2 < ∞[32].
In our experiment, we choose a diminishing step size 1/k to ensure the convergence of the algorithm.
The procedure, using dual ascent to diversify Bi, is summarized in Algorithm 2 in Appendix C.

Hidden constraints with one-step dual ascent
The weak correlated function ψ can also be chosen
as hidden constraint without an explicit expression. Speciﬁcally, the solution to sub-problem (22)
equipped with hidden constraints ψ corresponds exactly to one-step dual ascent in (23)(24). We
summarize the proposition as follows:

Proposition 3.1. Deﬁne an explicit weak constraint function ζ : Rn2 →R. For the constrained
optimization problem:
min
Bi
Q({Bi}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1)

s. t.

satisﬁes:
∇BiQ({Bk+1
i
}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1) −λk
i ∇ζ(Bk+1
i
) = 0.

Then there exists a constrained optimization problem with hidden weak constraint ψ : Rn2 →R:

min
Bi
Q({Bi}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1)

s. t.
ψ(Bi) = ψ(B),
∀i = 1, · · · , g,

such that ({Bk+1
i
}g
i=1, {λk
i }g
i=1) is a KKT pair of the above optimization problem.

Compared to explicit formulation, hidden weak constraints, while ensuring diversiﬁcation on correla-
tion, signiﬁcantly accelerate the algorithm’s speed by requiring only one-step dual ascent for updating.
Here, we set ζ(·) as log det(·), actually solving the optimization problem under corresponding hidden
constraint ψ. The comparison of computation time between explicit and hidden constraints, proof of
Proposition 3.1 and further explanations on hidden constraints are provided in Appendix D.

Considering that it’s sufﬁcient to model elements of a block as a ﬁrst order Auto-Regression
(AR) process [24] in which the intra-block correlation matrix is a Toeplitz matrix, we employ
this strategy for Bi. After estimating Bi by dual ascent, we then apply Toeplitz correction to Bi as

Global minimum and local minima

For the sake of simplicity, we denote the true signal as xtrue, which is the sparsest among all feasible
solutions. The block sparsity of the true signal is denoted as K0, indicating the presence of K0 blocks.
Let ˜G ≜diag
 √γ11, · · · , √γgL

, ˜B ≜diag (B1, · · · , Bg), thus Σ0 = ˜G ˜B ˜G. Additionally, we
assume that the measurement matrix Φ satisﬁes the URP condition [2]. We employed various
techniques to overcome highly non-linear structure of γ in diversiﬁed block sparse prior (5), resulting
in following global and local optimality theorems.

4.1
Analysis of global minimum
By introducing a negative sign to the cost function (16), we have the following result on the property
of global minimum and the threshold for block sparsity K0.

3The necessity of each step for updating Bi in line 9-11 of Algorithm 1 is detailed in Appendix A.

Theorem 4.1. As β →∞and K0 < (M +1)/2L, the unique global minimum bγ ≜(bγ11, . . . , bγgL)T

yields a recovery ˆx by (13) that is equal to xtrue, regardless of the estimated bBi (∀i).

The proof draws inspiration from [23] and is detailed in Appendix E. Theorem 4.1 shows that, in
noiseless case, achieving the global minimum of variance enables exact recovery of the true signal,
provided the block sparsity of the signal adheres to the given upper bound.

, and u is a vector satisfying yT u = C.

It’s clear that P is a full row rank matrix, i.e, r(P) = M. Given the above lemmas, we arrive at the
following result, which is proven in Appendix H.

Theorem 4.4. Every local minimum of the cost function (16) with respect to γ satisﬁes ||ˆγ||0 ≤
√

M,
irrespective of the estimated bBi (∀i) and β.

Theorem 4.4 establishes an upper bound on the sparsity level of any local minimum for the cost
function in terms of the parameter γ. Therefore, together with Theorem 4.1, these results ensure the
sparsity of the ﬁnal solution obtained.

Experiments

In this section, we compare DivSBL with the following six algorithms:4 1. Block-based algorithms:
(1) BSBL, (2) Group Lasso, (3) Group BPDN. 2. Pattern-based algorithms: (4) PC-SBL, (5)
StructOMP. 3. Sparse learning (without structural information): (6) SBL. Results are averaged
over 100 or 500 random runs (based on computational scale), with SNR ranging from 15-25 dB

except the test for varied noise levels. ‘Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE)’, deﬁned as

2, and ‘Correlation (Corr)’ (cosine similarity) are used to compare algorithms. 5

5.1
Synthetic signal data

We initially test on synthetic signal data, including homoscedastic (provided by [24]) and heteroscedas-
tic data, where block size, location, non-zero quantity, and signal variance are randomly generated,
mimicking real-world data patterns. The reconstruction results are provide in Appendix I.1. Table 1
shows that DivSBL achieves the lowest NMSE and the highest Correlation on both scenarios. To
more intuitively demonstrate the statistically signiﬁcant improvements of the conclusion, we provide
box plots of the experimental results on both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data in Figure 3 .

Unlike many frequentist approaches that require more complex debiasing methods to construct
conﬁdence intervals, the Bayesian approach offers a straightforward way to obtain credible intervals
for point estimates. For more results related to Bayesian methods, please refer to Appendix I.2.

5.2
The robustness of pre-deﬁned block sizes

As mentioned in Section 1, block-based algorithms require presetting block sizes, and their perfor-
mance is sensitive to these parameters, posing challenges in practice. This experiment assesses the
robustness of block-based algorithms with predeﬁned block sizes. The test setup is shown in Figure
4. We vary preset block sizes and conduct 100 experiments for all algorithms. Conﬁdence intervals
in Figure 4 depict reconstruction error for statistical signiﬁcance.

Figure 4: NMSE variation with changing preset block sizes.

Resolves the longstanding sensitivity issue of block-based algorithms.
DivSBL demonstrates
strong robustness to the preset block sizes, effectively addressing the sensitivity issue that block-based
algorithms commonly encounter with respect to block sizes.

Figure 5 visualizes the posterior variance learning on the signal to demonstrate DivSBL’s ability to
adaptively identify the true blocks. The algorithms are tested with preset block sizes of 20 (small), 50
(medium), and 125 (large), respectively, to show how each algorithm learns the blocks when block
structure is misspeciﬁed. As expected in Section 2.1 and Figure 2 , DivSBL is able to adaptively ﬁnd
the true block through diversiﬁcation learning and remains robust to the preset block size.

Exhibits enhanced recovery capability in challenging scenarios.
The optimal block size for
DivSBL is around 20-50, which is more consistent with the true block sizes. This indicates that when
true block sizes are large and varied, DivSBL can effectively capture richer information within each
block by setting larger block sizes, thereby signiﬁcantly improving the recovery performance. In
contrast, other algorithms do not perform as well as DivSBL, even at their optimal block sizes.

5NMSE quantiﬁes the numerical closeness of two vectors, while correlation measures the accuracy of
estimating a target support set and the level of recovery similarity within that set (also utilized in [33]). Therefore,
employing both metrics together can more comprehensively reﬂect the structural sparse recovery of the target.

1D audioSet

As shown in Figure 14, audio signals exhibit block sparse structures in discrete cosine transform
(DCT) basis, which is well-suited for assessing block sparse algorithms. In this subsection, we
carry out experiments on real-world audios, which are randomly chosen in AudioSet [34]. The
reconstruction results are present in Appendix J. In the main text, we focus on analyzing DivSBL’s
sensitivity to sample rate, evaluating its performance across different noise levels, and investigating
its phase transition properties.

The sensitivity of sample rate
The algorithms are tested on audio sets to investigate the sensitivity
of sample rate (M/N) varied from 0.25 to 0.55. The result is visualized in Figure 16. Notably,
DivSBL emerges as the top performer across diverse sampling rates, showing a consistent 1 dB
enhancement in NMSE compared to the best-performing algorithm among others.

The performance under various noise levels
We assess each algorithm as Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) varied from 10 to 50 and include the standard deviation from 100 random experiments on
audio sets. Here, we present the performance under the minimum sampling rate 0.25 tested before,
which represents a challenging recovery scenario. As shown in Table 2, the performance of all
algorithms improves with higher SNR. Notably, DivSBL consistently leads across all SNR levels.

Phase Transition
This audio data contains approximately 90 non-zero elements in DCT domain
(K = 90), which constitutes about 20% of the total dimensionality (N = 480). Therefore, we start
the test with a sampling rate of a same 20%. In this scenario, M/K is roughly 1 and increases with
the sampling rate. Concurrently, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies gradually from 10 to 50.

The phase transition diagram in Figure 6 shows that DivSBL performs well at more extreme sampling
rates and is better suited for lower SNR conditions.

2D image reconstruction

In 2D image experiments, we utilize a standard set of grayscale images compiled from two sources 6.
As depicted in Figure 17, the images exhibit block sparsity in discrete wavelet domain. In Section
5.3, we’ve shown DivSBL’s leading performance across diverse sampling rates. Here, we use a 0.5
sample rate and the reconstruction errors are in Table 3 and Appendix K. DivSBL’s reconstructions
surpass others, with an average improvement of 9.8% on various images.

Figure 7: Reconstruction results for Parrot, Monarch and House images.

In Figure 7, we display the ﬁnal reconstructions of Parrot, Monarch and House images as examples.
DivSBL is capable of preserving the ﬁner features of the parrot, such as cheek, eye, etc., and
recovering the background smoothly with minimal error stripes. As for Monarch and House images,
nearly every reconstruction introduces undesirable artifacts and stripes, while images restored by
DivSBL show the least amount of noise patterns, demonstrating the most effective restoration.

Conclusions

This paper established a new Bayesian learning model by introducing diversiﬁed block sparse prior,
to effectively capture the prevalent block sparsity observed in real-world data. The novel Bayesian
model effectively solved the sensitivity issue in existing block sparse learning methods, allowing
for adaptive block estimation and reducing the risk of overﬁtting. The proposed algorithm DivSBL,
based on this model, enjoyed solid theoretical guarantees on both convergence and sparsity theory.
Experimental results demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance on multimodal data. Future works
include exploration on more effective weak constraints for correlation matrices, and applications on
supervised learning tasks such as regression and classiﬁcation.

Experimental result of diversifying correlation matrices

(a) A complete iteration record
(b) The ﬁrst 60 iterations

Figure 8: NMSE with iteration number.

Below, we will explain the necessity of the three steps for updating B in DivSBL:

(1) Firstly, the purpose of the ﬁrst step, estimating B under a strong constraint, is to avoid overﬁtting.
As shown by the green line (Diff-BSBL) in Figure 8 , algorithm without strong constraints tend to
worsen NMSE after several iterations due to overﬁtting.

(2) Since the strong constraint in (1) forces all blocks to have the same correlation, it leads to the
loss of speciﬁcity in correlation matrices within different blocks. Therefore, the motivation for the
second step, applying weak constraints, is to make the correlations within blocks similar to some
extent while preserving their individual speciﬁcities. As the black line in Figure 8 (DivSBL-without
diversiﬁed correlation) shows, DivSBL without weak constraints fails to capture the speciﬁcity within
blocks, resulting in a loss of accuracy and slower speed compare to DivSBL.

(3) The third step, Toeplitzization, inherits the advantages of BSBL, allowing the correlation matrices
to have a reasonable structure.

Overall, while BSBL utilizes a single variance and a shared correlation matrix within each block,
DivSBL incorporates diversiﬁcation into both variance and correlation matrix modeling, making it
more ﬂexible and enhancing its performance.

Hence, Σ0 is split into two components in (27), with the second term of the summation only
depending on Gi and Bi, and the ﬁrst part D−i being entirely unrelated to them. Then, we can
update each Bi and Gi independently, allowing us to learn diverse Bi and Gi for different blocks.

The procedure for solving the constrained optimization problem

To clarify the dual problem of (P), we ﬁrstly express (P)’s Lagrange function as

L({Bi}g
i=1; {λi}g
i=1) =1

2 log det Σ0 + 1


Σ−1
0 (Σ + µµT )


X

i=1
λi(log det Bi −log det B).

(31)
Since the constraints in (P) are equalities, we do not impose any requirements on the multipliers
{λi}g
i=1. The primal and dual problems in terms of L are given by

min
{Bi}g
i=1

{λi}g

L({Bi}g

{λi}g
i=1
min
{Bi}g
i=1
L({Bi}g
i=1; {λi}g
i=1),
(D)

respectively. Although the objective here is non-convex, dual ascent method takes advantage of the
fact that the dual problem is always convex [32], and we can get a lower bound of (P) by solving (D).
Speciﬁcally, dual ascent method employs gradient ascent on the dual variables. As long as the step
sizes are chosen properly, the algorithm would converge to a local maximum. We will demonstrate
how to choose the step sizes in the following paragraph.

According to this framework, we ﬁrst solve the inner minimization problem of the dual problem (D).
Keeping the multipliers {λi}g
i=1 ﬁxed, the inner problem is

Bk+1
i
∈arg min
Bi L({Bi}g
i=1; {λk
i }g
i=1) = arg min
Bi L(Bi; λk
i ),
(32)

where the superscript k implies the k-th iteration. According to the ﬁrst-order optimality condition,
the primal solution for (32) is as follows:

Bk+1
i
=
G−1
i

Σi + µi  
µiT 
G−1
i
1 + 2λk
i
.
(33)

Subsequently, the outer maximization problem for the multiplier λi (dual variable) can be addressed
using the gradient ascent method. The update formulation is obtained by

λk+1
i
= λk
i + αk
i ∇λiL({Bk
i }g
i=1; {λi}g
i=1)

= λk
i + αk
i ∇λiL(Bk
i ; λi)

= λk
i + αk
i (log det Bk
i −log det B),
(34)

in which, αk
i represents the step size in the k-th iteration for updating the multiplier λi (i = 1...g).
Convergence is only guaranteed if the step size satisﬁes P∞
k=1 αk
i = ∞and P∞
k=1(αk
i )2 < ∞[32].
Therefore, we choose a diminishing step size 1/k to ensure the convergence. The procedure, using
dual ascent method to diversify Bi, is summarized in Algorithm 2 as follows:

Algorithm 2 Diversifying Bi

1: Input: Initialized λ0

The computing time and the explanation of one-step dual ascent

Computing time
As our algorithm is based on Bayesian learning and involves covariance structures

---Page Break---
(group Lasso, group BPDN). Here, we provide curves of NMSE versus CPU time for DivSBL,
DivSBL (with complete dual ascent), and BSBL to better visualize the speed of the algorithms. In
Figure 9, DivSBL shows larger NMSE reductions at each time step compared to both BSBL and fully
iterative DivSBL.

One-step dual ascent
It has been observed that imposing strong constraints Bi = B leads to slow
convergence, while not applying any constraints results in overﬁtting [24].

Figure 9: Comparison of Computation Time

Therefore, by establishing weak constraints and
employing dual ascent to solve the constrained
optimization problem (P), we achieve diversiﬁ-
cation on intra-block correlation matrices, which
are more aligned with real-life modeling. Since
the convergence speed of dual ascent is fastest in
the initial few steps and sub-problems are unnec-
essary to be solved accurately, our initial moti-
vation was to consider allowing it to iterate only
once, which yielded promising experimental re-
sults, as shown in the Figure 9.

We consider providing further theoretical and intuitive explanations. From another perspective, the
tuple (Bk+1
i
, λk
i ) satisfying the update formula (23)(24) in the text is, in fact, a KKT pair of a certain
constrained optimization problem, which is summarized in Proposition 3.1.

Proof of Proposition 3.1

Proof. Construct a weak constraint function ψ : Rn2 →R such that:

∇ψ(Bk+1
i
) = ∇ζ(Bk+1
i
)

ψ(Bk+1
i
) = ψ(B)

Such a function ψ always exists. In fact, we can always construct a polynomial function ψ that
satisﬁes the given conditions (Hermitte interpolation polynomial). The ﬁnite conditions of function
values and derivatives correspond to a system of linear equations for the coefﬁcients of the polynomial
function. Since the degree of the polynomial function is arbitrary, we can always ensure that the
system of linear equations has a solution by increasing the degree.

Since ∇BiQ({Bk+1
i
}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1) −λk
i ∇ζ(Bk+1
i
) = 0, we have:

∇BiQ({Bk+1
i
}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1) −λk
i ∇ψ(Bk+1
i
) = 0

ψ(Bk+1
i
) = ψ(B)

Thus, ({Bk+1
i
}g
i=1, {λk
i }g
i=1) forms a KKT pair of the above optimization problem.

From the proposition above, it can be observed that the tuple (Bk+1
i
, λk
i ) satisfying equation (23)(24)
is, in fact, a KKT point of a certain weakly constrained optimization problem. Therefore, although
we do not precisely solve the constrained optimization problem under the weak constraint ζ(·) (i.e.,
log det(·) in the main text), we accurately solve the constrained optimization problem under the
weak constraint ψ(·). Even though this weak constraint ψ(·) is unknown, it certainly exists and
may be better than the original weak constraint ζ(·). This perspective aligns with the concept of
inverse optimization [35]. Interestingly, the technique here provides an application case for inverse
optimization. From this viewpoint, we are still optimizing Q function with the weak constraint
ψ(·), and the subproblems under the weak constraint ψ(·) are accurately solved. Therefore, similar
to the constrained EM algorithm, it can still generate a sequence of solutions, which explains the
experimental results mentioned above.

Meanwhile, the above method can also be viewed as a regularized EM algorithm [36]. The update
formula (23) corresponds to the exact solution of the regularized Q function Q({Bi}g
i=1, {Gi}g
i=1)−

g(x) = O(1) + [M −min(M, KL)] log β−1,

where K represents the estimated number of blocks and β−1 →0 (noiseless). Therefore, when g(x)
achieves its minimum value by (36), K will achieve its minimum value simultaneously.

The results in [38] demonstrate that if K0 < M+1

2L , then no other solution exists such that y = Φx
with K < M+1

2L . Therefore, we have K ≥K0, and when K reaches its minimum value K0, the

The LHS ωT Zω is linear with respect to Z. And for the RHS, ωT ΦΣ0ΦT ω + β−1ωT ω =
qT Σ0q + β−1ωT ω, where q = ΦT ω, and Σ0 can bu reformulated as

γ ⪰0,

(38)

where Σy = β−1I + ΦΣ0ΦT , P and b are already deﬁned in Lemma 4.3. In order to analyze
the property of the minimization problem (38), we introduce a symmetric matrix Z ∈RM×M here.
Therefore, the problem with respect to Z and γ becomes

It is evident that problem (38) and problem (a) are equivalent. Denote the solution of (a) as (Z∗, γ∗),
so γ∗here is also the solution of (38). Thus, we will analysis the minimization problem (a) instead in
the following paragraph.

We ﬁrst demonstrate the concavity of (a). Obviously, with respect to Z and
 √γ ⊗√γ

, the objective
function log det Z is concave, and (a.3) is convex. According to Lemma 4.2, (a.2) is convex as well.
Hence, we only need to show the convexity of (a.4) with respect to Z and

As mentioned in Section 2.1.3, homoscedasticity can be seen as a special case of our model. Therefore,
we test our algorithm on homoscedastic data provided in [24]. In this dataset, each block shares the
same size L = 6, and the amplitudes within each block follow a homoscedastic normal distribution.

The reconstructed results are shown in Figure 10, Figure 3 and the ﬁrst part of Table 1. DivSBL

The sensitivity to initialization

According to our algorithm, given the variance γij, the prior covariance matrix can be obtained
as Σ0 = diag(√γ11, · · · , √γgL) ˜Bdiag(√γ11, · · · , √γgL). In the absence of any structural infor-

mation, the initial correlation matrix ˜B is set to the identity matrix. Consequently, the mean and
covariance matrix for the ﬁrst iteration can also be determined. Since other variables are derived from
the variance, we only need to test the sensitivity to the initial values of variances γ.

We test the sensitivity of DivSBL to initialization on the heteroscedastic signal from Section 5.1.
Initial variances are set to γ = η · ones(gL, 1) and γ = η · rand(gL, 1) with the scale parameter η
ranging from 1 × 10−1 to 1 × 104. The result in Figure 26 shows that while initialization could affect
the convergence speed to some extent, the algorithm’s overall convergence is assured.

(a) γ = η · ones(gL, 1)
(b) γ = η · rand(gL, 1)

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The main claims present in abstract and introduction (Section 1) have reﬂected
the paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: In Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.4, we conclude the proof under a noiseless
assumption. And we conjecture that similar conclusion hold even in the noise case. In
Section 5.3, we evaluate the algorithm’s robustness at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
The experimental results consistently show leading performance of the proposed algorithm
across various noise environments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

24


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: All the theorems and assumptions are clearly stated in Section 4. Appendix
E–H present the proof of them.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: For reproducibility, experiment details are provided in each subsection of
Section 5. Additionally, the code is available in the Supplementary Material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: For reproducibility, experiment code is available in Supplementary Material.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The full details are provided with code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropriate
information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The results are accompanied by conﬁdence intervals, as shown in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁ-
dence intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

26


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The paper have provided compute time in Section 5 and Appendix D. Details
on compute worker are provided in code (README.md).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The research conducted in the paper adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: There is no societal impact of the work performed. The paper aims to explore
new technical methods or algorithms without delving into topics related to societal impact.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

27


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety ﬁlters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The data and code used in the paper have all been properly credited , and
citations are provided in the text.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

28


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

29


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary signiﬁcantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
