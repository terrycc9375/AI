Abstract
Surface parameterization plays an essential role in numerous computer graphics
and geometry processing applications. Traditional parameterization approaches are
designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers,
thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D
data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple
topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part
segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything
Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary
surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on
the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the
2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously
construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of
surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled
into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods,
our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity
information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality

and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is
fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex
topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and
UV boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority,

Introduction

Surface parameterization intuitively refers to the process of flattening a 3D geometric surface onto a
2D plane, which is typically called the parameter domain. For any 3D spatial point (x, y, z) lying on
the underlying surface, we explicitly map it to a 2D planar coordinate (u, v) while satisfying certain
continuity and distortion constraints. Building such point-to-point mappings is also known as UV
unwrapping, which serves as an indispensable component in modern graphics rendering pipelines for
texture mapping and is also widely used in many downstream geometry processing applications, such
as remeshing, mesh completion/compression, detail transfer, surface fitting, and editing, etc.

Theoretically, for any two geometric surfaces with identical/similar topological structures, there exists
a bijective mapping between them. Nevertheless, when the topology of the target 3D surface becomes
complicated (e.g., with high genus), one must pre-open the original mesh to a sufficiently-developable
disk along appropriate cutting seams. Consequently, the current industrial practice for implementing
UV unwrapping is typically composed of two stages: (1) manually specifying some necessary cutting
seams on the original mesh; (2) applying mature disk-topology-oriented parameterization algorithms
(e.g., LSCM [15], ABF [31, 33]) which have been well integrated into popular 3D modeling software
(e.g., Blender, Unity, 3Ds Max) to produce per-vertex 2D UV coordinates. In practice, such stage-wise
UV unwrapping pipeline still shows the following limitations and inconveniences:

1) Commonly-used surface parameterization algorithms are designed for well-behaved meshes, which
are typically produced by specialized 3D modelers and technical artists. However, with the advent of
user-generated content (UGC) fueled by the rapidly growing 3D sensing, reconstruction [24, 14], and
generation [26, 28, 18, 34] techniques, there emerges an urgent need for dealing with ordinary 3D
data possibly with unruly anomalies, inferior triangulations, and non-ideal geometries.

2) Despite the existence of a few early attempts at heuristic seam generation [32, 8], the process of
finding high-quality cutting seams in practical applications still relies on manual efforts and personal
experience. Hence, the entire workflow remains subjective and semi-automated, leading to reduced
reliability and efficiency, especially when dealing with complex 3D models that users are unfamiliar
with. Besides, since cutting is actually achieved via edge selection, one may need to repeatedly adjust
the distribution of mesh edges to allow the cutting seams to walk through.

3) The procedures of cutting the original mesh into a disk and then flattening the resulting disk onto
the parameter domain should have been mutually influenced and jointly optimized; otherwise, the
overall surface parameterization results could be sub-optimal.

In recent years, there has emerged a new family of neural parameterization approaches targeted at
learning parameterized 3D geometric representations via neural network architectures. The pioneering
works of FoldingNet [39] and AtlasNet [11] are among the best two representatives, which can build
point-wise mappings via deforming a pre-defined 2D lattice grid to reconstruct the target 3D shape.
RegGeoNet [41] and Flattening-Net [42] tend to achieve fixed-boundary rectangular structurization
of irregular 3D point clouds through geometry image [12, 21] representations. However, these two
approaches cannot be regarded as real-sense surface parameterization due to their lack of mapping
constraints. DiffSR [2] and Nuvo [36] focus on the local parameterization of the original 3D surface
but with explicit and stronger constraints on the learned neural mapping process. Their difference
lies in that DiffSR aggregates multi-patch parameterizations to reconstruct the original geometric
surface, while Nuvo adaptively assigns surface points to different charts in a probabilistic manner.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate neural surface parameterization featured by both
global mapping and free boundary. We introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), a universal and
fully-automated UV unwrapping approach to build point-to-point mappings between 3D points lying
on the target geometric surface and 2D UV coordinates within the adaptively-deformed parameter
domain. In general, FAM is designed as an unsupervised learning pipeline (i.e., no ground-truth UV

maps are collected), running in a per-model overfitting manner. To mimic the actual physical process,
we ingeniously design a series of geometrically-meaningful sub-networks with specific functionalities
of surface cutting, UV deforming, 3D-to-2D unwrapping, and 2D-to-3D wrapping, which are further
assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. By optimizing a combination of different
loss functions and auxiliary differential geometric constraints, FAM is able to find reasonable 3D
cutting seams and 2D UV boundaries, leading to superior parameterization quality when dealing with
different degrees of geometric and topological complexities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the advantages of our approach over traditional state-of-the-art approaches. Conclusively, our FAM
shows the following several major aspects of characteristics and superiorities:

• Compared with traditional mesh parameterization approaches [15, 33, 29], FAM directly operates
on discrete surface points and jointly learns surface cutting, which can be insensitive to mesh
triangulations and is able to deal with non-ideal geometries and arbitrarily-complex topologies.
Besides, such a pure neural learning architecture can naturally exploit the powerful parallelism
of GPUs and is much easier for implementing, tuning, and further extension.
• Another distinct advantage lies in the smoothness of parameterization. Since mesh parameteriza-
tion computes parameters solely for existing vertices, for any point on the mesh that is not a
vertex, these approaches resort to interpolation within its encompassing triangle to determine the
corresponding UV coordinate. Such practice fails to guarantee smoothness, particularly across
edges, and this issue is further exacerbated in low-resolution meshes. By contrast, FAM exploits
the inherent smooth property [30] of neural networks to learn arbitrary point-to-point mappings,
thereby ensuring smoothness for all points on the target surface.
• Different from previous multi-patch local parameterization frameworks [11, 2, 36], FAM focuses
on global parameterization, a more valuable yet much harder problem setting.
• Different from previous fixed-boundary structurization frameworks [41, 42], FAM deforms the
2D UV parameter domain adaptively and regularizes the learned neural mapping explicitly, thus
significantly reducing discontinuities and distortions.

2.1
Traditional Parameterization Approaches

Early approaches formulate mesh parameterization as a Laplacian problem, where boundary points are
anchored to a pre-determined convex 2D curve [7, 9], tackled by sparse linear system solvers. Such a
linear strategy is appreciated for its simplicity, efficiency, and the guarantee of bijectivity. However,
the rigidity of fixing boundary points in the parameter domain usually leads to significant distortions.
In response to these issues, free-boundary parameterization algorithms [33, 19] have been proposed,
offering a more flexible setting by relaxing boundary constraints. Although these approaches bring
certain improvements, they often struggle to maintain global bijectivity. More recent state-of-the-art
approaches [29, 35] shift towards minimizing simpler proxy energies by alternating between local
and global optimization phases, which not only accelerate convergence but also enhance the overall
parameterization quality. OptCuts [16] explores joint optimization of surface cutting and mapping
distortion. Despite the continuous advancements, the working mechanisms of all these approaches
fundamentally rely on the connectivity information inherent in mesh structures, casting doubt on their
applicability to unstructured point clouds. Moreover, mesh-oriented parameterization approaches
typically assume that the inputs are well-behaved meshes possessing relatively regular triangulations.
When faced with input meshes of inferior quality characterized by irregular triangulations and
anomalies, remeshing becomes an indispensable procedure. Additionally, how to deal with non-
ideal geometries and complex topologies (e.g., non-manifolds, multiply-connected components, thin
structures) has always been highly challenging.

Unlike surface meshes, unstructured point clouds lack information regarding the connectivity between
points, and thus are much more difficult to parameterize. Hence, only a relatively limited amount
of prior works [43] have focused on the parameterization of surface point clouds. Early studies
investigate various specialized parameterization strategies for disk-type [10, 1, 40], genus-0 [44,
17], genus-1 [37], well-sampled [13] or low-quality [22] point clouds. Later approaches achieve
fixed-boundary spherical/rectangular parameterization through approximating the Laplace-Beltrami
operators [5] or Teichmüller extremal mappings [23]. More recently, FBCP-PC [4] further pursues
free-boundary conformal parameterization, in which a new point cloud Laplacian approximation
scheme is proposed for handling boundary non-convexity.

Neural Parameterization Approaches

Driven by the remarkable success of deep learning, there is a family of recent works applying neural
networks to learn parameterized 3D geometric representations. FoldingNet [39] proposes to deform a
uniform 2D grid to reconstruct the target 3D point cloud for unsupervised geometric feature learning.
AtlasNet [11] applies multi-grid deformation to learn locally parameterized representations. Subse-
quently, a series of follow-up researches inherit such a “folding-style” parameterization paradigm as
pioneered by [39, 11] and investigate different aspects of modifications. GTIF [3] introduces graph
topology inference and filtering mechanisms, empowering the decoder to preserve more representative
geometric features in the latent space. EleStruc [6] proposes to perform shape reconstruction from
learnable 3D elementary structures, rather than a pre-defined 2D lattice. Similarly, TearingNet [27]
adaptively breaks the edges of an initial primitive graph for emulating the topology of the target
3D point cloud, which can effectively deal with higher-genus or multi-object inputs. In fact, the
ultimate goal of the above line of approaches is to learn expressive shape codewords by means of
deformation-driven 3D surface reconstruction. The characteristics of surface parameterization, i.e.,
the mapping process between 3D surfaces and 2D parameter domains, are barely considered.

In contrast to the extensive research in the fields of deep learning-based 3D geometric reconstruction
and feature learning, there only exist a few studies that particularly focus on neural surface param-
eterization. DiffSR [2] adopts the basic multi-patch reconstruction framework [11] and explicitly
regularizes multiple differential surface properties. NSM [25] explores neural encoding of surface
maps by overfitting a neural network to an existing UV parameterization pre-computed via standard
mesh parameterization algorithms [38, 29]. DA-Wand [20] constructs a parameterization-oriented
mesh segmentation framework. Around a specified triangle, it learns to select a local sub-region,
which is supposed to be sufficiently developable to produce low-distortion parameterization. Inherit-
ing the geometry image (GI) [12] representation paradigm, RegGeoNet [41] and Flattening-Net [42]
propose to learn deep regular representations of unstructured 3D point clouds. However, these two
approaches lack explicit constraints on the parameterization distortions, and their local-to-global
assembling procedures are hard to control. More recently, Nuvo [36] proposes a neural UV mapping
framework that operates on oriented 3D points sampled from arbitrary 3D representations, liberating
from the stringent quality demands of mesh triangulation. This approach assigns the original surface
to multiple charts and ignores the packing procedure, thus essentially differing from our targeted
global parameterization setting.

Proposed Method

Our FAM operates on discrete spatial points lying on the target 3D geometric surface for achieving
global free-boundary parameterization in an unsupervised learning manner. Denote by P ∈RN×3 a
set of unstructured points without any connectivity information, we aim at point-wisely parameterizing
(i.e., row-wisely mapping) P onto the planar domain to produce UV coordinates Q ∈RN×2.

Technical Motivation. The most straightforward way of learning such a surface flattening process is
to directly impose certain appropriate regularizers over the resulting 2D UV coordinates Q. However,
due to the missing of ground-truths, it is impossible to explicitly supervise the generation of Q, and it
empirically turns out that designing and minimizing such regularizers cannot produce satisfactory
results. Alternatively, another feasible scheme is to choose an opposite mapping direction to wrap the
adaptively-deformed and potentially-optimal 2D UV coordinates ˆQ ∈RN×2 onto the target surface
by generating a new set of unstructured points ˆP ∈RN×3, which should approximate the input P by
minimizing certain point set similarity metrics. Under ideal situations where ˆP and P are losslessly
matched, we can equivalently deduce the desired UV coordinate of each point in P (i.e., for a certain
3D point pi ∈P perfectly matched with a generated 3D point ˆpj ∈ˆP, which is row-wisely mapped
from ˆqj ∈ˆQ, then we know the UV coordinate of pi should be ˆqj). However, due to the practical
difficulty of reconstructing point sets with high-precision point-wise matching, the generated ˆP is
only able to coarsely recover the target surface, thereby ˆQ cannot be treated as the resulting 2D UV
coordinates of the input P. Still, despite the inaccuracy of such inverse 2D-to-3D wrapping process,
it provides valuable cues indicating how the target 3D surface is roughly transformed from the 2D
parameter domain, which naturally motivates us to combine the two opposite mapping processes
into a bi-directional joint learning architecture. To build associations between the unwrapping and
wrapping processes and promote mapping bijectivity, we further introduce cycle mapping mechanisms

and impose consistency constraints. Thus, our FAM is designed as a bi-directional cycle mapping
workflow, in which all sub-networks are parameter-sharing and jointly-optimized.

3.1
Bi-directional Cycle Mapping

As illustrated in Figure 2, there are two parallel learning branches comprising a series of geometrically-
meaningful sub-networks built upon point-wisely shared multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs):

• The deforming network Md (Deform-Net) takes a uniform 2D lattice as input, and deforms the
initial grid points to potentially-optimal UV coordinates.
• The wrapping network Mw (Wrap-Net) wraps the potentially-optimal 2D UV coordinates onto
the target 3D geometric surface.
• The surface cutting network Mc (Cut-Net) finds appropriate cutting seams for transforming the
original 3D geometric structure to an open and highly-developable surface manifold.
• The unwrapping network Mu (Unwrap-Net) assumes that its input surface has already been
pre-opened, and flattens the 3D points onto the 2D parameter domain.

3.1.1
2D→3D→2D Cycle Mapping

The upper learning branch begins with a pre-defined 2D lattice with N grid points uniformly sampled
within [−1, 1]2, denoted as G ∈RN×2. To perform adaptive UV space deformation, we employ an
offset-based coordinate updating strategy by feeding G into the Deform-Net to produce another set
of 2D UV coordinates ˆQ ∈RN×2, which can be formulated as:
ˆQ = Md(G) = ξ′′
d([ξ′
d(G); G]) + G,
(1)

where [∗; ∗] denotes channel concatenation, ξ′
d : R2 →Rh and ξ′′
d : R(h+2) →R2 are stacked MLPs.
Intuitively, the initial 2D grid points are first embedded through ξ′
d into the h-dimensional latent
space, concatenated with itself, and then mapped onto the 2D planar domain through ξ′′
d. The learned
offsets are point-wisely added to the initial grid points to produce the resulting ˆQ.

After that, we perform 2D-to-3D wrapping by feeding the generated ˆQ into the Wrap-Net to produce
ˆP ∈RN×3, which is expected to roughly approximate the target 3D geometric structure represented
by the input 3D point set P. In the meantime, we use three more output channels to produce normals
ˆPn ∈RN×3. The whole network behavior can be described as:

[ˆP; ˆPn] = Mw(ˆQ) = ξ′′
w([ξ′
w(ˆQ); ˆQ]),
(2)

where ξ′
w : R2 →Rh and ξ′′
w : R(h+2) →R6 are stacked MLPs, and the resulting 6 output channels
are respectively split into ˆP and ˆPn.

---Page Break---
In order to construct cycle mapping, we further apply the Cut-Net on the reconstructed ˆP, which is
transformed into an open 3D surface manifold ˆPcut ∈RN×3, as given by:
ˆPcut = Mc(ˆP) = ξ′′
c ([ξ′
c(ˆP); ˆP]) + ˆP,
(3)

where ξ′
c : R3 →Rh and ξ′′
c : R(h+3) →R3 are stacked MLPs.

Once we obtain the highly-developable 3D surface manifold ˆPcut, it is straightforward to perform
3D-to-2D flattening through the Unwrap-Net, which can be formulated as:
ˆQcycle = Mu(ˆPcut) = ξu(ˆPcut),
(4)

where ξu : R3 →R2 is simply implemented as stacked MLPs, and the resulting ˆQcycle ∈RN×2 is
expected to be row-wisely equal to ˆQ.

3.1.2
3D→2D→3D Cycle Mapping

The bottom learning branch directly starts by feeding the input 3D point set P into the Cut-Net to
produce an open 3D surface manifold Pcut, which can be formulated as:
Pcut = Mc(P) = ξ′′
c ([ξ′
c(P); P]) + P.
(5)

After that, we apply the Unwrap-Net on the generated Pcut to produce the desired 2D UV coordinates
Q, as given by:
Q = Mu(Pcut) = ξu(Pcut).
(6)

In order to construct cycle mapping, we further apply the Wrap-Net on the generated Q for recovering
the target 3D geometric structure, which can be formulated as:
[Pcycle; Pn
cycle] = Mw(Q) = ξ′′
w([ξ′
w(Q); Q]),
(7)
where Pcycle is expected to be row-wisely equal to P. When the input surface points are accompanied
by normals Pn ∈RN×3, we also expect that the normal directions of Pn and the generated Pn
cycle
should be row-wisely consistent.

Remark. Throughout the overall bi-directional cycle mapping framework, only Q is regarded as the
desired 2D UV coordinates that are row-wisely mapped from the input 3D surface points P, all the
others (e.g., ˆQ and ˆQcycle) just serve as intermediate results. Morevoer, it is also worth emphasizing
that, when the training is finished, any arbitrary surface-sampled 3D points can be fed into our FAM
to obtain point-wise UV coordinates.

Extraction of Cutting Seams. The extraction of points located on the learned cutting seams, which
we denote as E = {ei ∈P}, can be conveniently achieved by comparing the mapping relationships
between the input P and the parameterized Q.

Specifically, since P and Q are mapped in a row-wise manner, for each input 3D point pi ∈P and
its K-nearest neighbors {p(k)
i
}Kcut
k=1 within P, we can directly know their 2D UV coordinates, denoted
as qi ∈Q and {q(k)
i
}Kcut
k=1 . The maximum distance value ηi between qi and its neighboring points
can be computed as:
ηi = max({∥qi −q(k)
i
∥2}Kcut
k=1 ).
(8)
Then, pi will be determined to locate on the cutting seam if ηi is larger than a certain threshold Tcut.
Collecting all such points within P can deduce a set of seam points E, and it is observed that in this
way no seam points would be identified if cutting the original 3D surface is actually unnecessary.

3.2
Training Objectives

As an unsupervised learning framework, FAM is trained by minimizing a series of carefully-designed
objective functions and constraints, whose formulations and functionalities are introduced below.

Unwrapping Loss. The most fundamental requirement for Q is that any two parameterized coor-
dinates cannot overlap. Hence, for each 2D UV coordinate qi, we search its K-nearest-neighbors
{q(k)
i
}Ku
k=1, and penalize neighboring points that are too close, as given by:

ℓunwrap =

N
X

i=1

Ku
X

k=1
max(0, ϵ −∥qi −q(k)
i
∥2),
(9)

6


---Page Break---
where the minimum distance value allowed between neighboring points is controlled by a threshold ϵ.

Wrapping Loss. The major supervision of the upper learning branch is that the generated point set
ˆP should roughly approximate the original 3D geometric structure represented by P. Since ˆP and P
are not row-wisely corresponded, we use the commonly-used Chamfer distance CD(∗; ∗) to measure
point set similarity, as given by:
ℓwrap = CD(ˆP; P).
(10)

Here, there is no need to impose the unwrapping loss over ˆP, since we empirically find that optimizing
the CD loss naturally suppresses clustered point distribution. Besides, we do not optimize CD( ˆQ; Q),
since we observe degraded performances, possibly because in earlier training iterations ˆQ and Q are
far from optimal and thus can interfere with each other.

Cycle Consistency Loss. Our bi-directional cycle mapping framework aims to promote consistencies
within both 3D and 2D domains, which are natural to learn thanks to our symmetric designs of the
functionalities of sub-networks. Thus, the cycle consistency loss is formulated as:

ℓcycle = ∥P −Pcycle∥1 + ∥ˆQ −ˆQcycle∥1 + CS(Pn; Pn
cycle),
(11)

where CS(∗; ∗) computes point-wise cosine similarity between Pn
cycle and ground-truth normals Pn,
which can be removed when ground-truth normals are not provided or hard to compute.

Mapping Distortion Constraint. We regularize the distortion of the learned neural mapping function
by exploiting differential surface properties, which can be conveniently deduced via the automatic
differentiation mechanisms in common deep learning programming frameworks.

Throughout the bi-directional cycle mapping framework, 2D UV coordinates Q and ˆQ are respectively
mapped to 3D surface points Pcycle and ˆP. For convenience, here we denote the two neural mapping
functions as f : R2 →R3 and g : R2 →R3. We compute the derivatives of f and g with respect to
Q and ˆQ at each 2D UV point (u, v) to obtain the Jacobian matrices Jf ∈R3×2 and Jg ∈R3×2:

Jf = (fu fv), Jg = (gu gv)
(12)

where fu, fv, gu, gv are three-dimensional vectors of partial derivatives. Then we further deduce the
eigenvalues of JT
f Jf and JT
g Jg, which are denoted as (λ1
f, λ2
f) and (λ1
g, λ2
g). Thus, we can promote
conformal (i.e., angle-preserving) parameterizations by constraining the following regularizer:

ℓconf =
X

q∈Q
∥λ1
f −λ2
f∥1 +
X

ˆq∈ˆQ
∥λ1
g −λ2
g∥1.

Experiments

We collected a series of 3D surface models with different types and complexities of geometric and/or
topological structures for experimental evaluation. We made qualitative and quantitative comparisons
with SLIM [29], a state-of-the-art and widely-used mesh parameterization algorithm. Additionally, we
also compared our FAM with FBCP-PC [4] for unstructured and unoriented (i.e., without normals) 3D
point cloud parameterization. Finally, we conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed bi-directional cycle mapping framework and the necessity of Cut-Net, together
with different aspects of verifications for comprehensively understanding the characteristics of our
approach. Due to page limitations, detailed technical implementations and additional experimental
results are presented in our Appendix

Comparison with SLIM [29]. Considering that SLIM is only able to be applied on disk-topologies
or surfaces with open boundaries, we collected 8 such testing models for parameterization, using
its officially-released code. For the training of our FAM, we uniformly sample 10, 000 points from
the original mesh vertices at each optimization iteration. During testing, the whole vertex set is fed
into our FAM to produce per-vertex UV coordinates. Then, we can perform checker-map texture
mappings for qualitative evaluation. For quantitative evaluation, we computed conformality metrics
(the lower, the better) by measuring the average of the absolute angle differences between each
corresponding angle of the 3D triangles and the 2D parameterized triangles. As shown in Figure 3
and Table 1, our FAM outperforms SLIM both qualitatively and quantitatively on all testing models.

Parameterization with Different Geometric and Topological Complexities. We conducted more
comprehensive experimental evaluations, as displayed in Figure 4 and Table 2, showing the universal-
ity and robustness of our approach.

Comparison with FBCP-PC [4]. Since FAM operates on discrete surface-sampled points without
any dependence on connectivity information, applying our approach to parameterize unstructured
and unoriented 3D point clouds is straightforward and basically seamless. The only modification
is to remove the supervision of point-wise normals, i.e., the last term CS(Pn; Pn
cycle) in Eqn. (11).
As compared in Figure 5 and Table 3, our performances are not better than FBCP-PC. However, we
must point out that FBCP-PC requires manually specifying indices of boundary points (arranged in
order) as additional inputs. Hence, the comparisons are actually quite unfair to us.

Ablation Studies. We evaluated the necessity of our two-branch joint learning architecture. First, we
removed the upper 2D→3D→2D branch to show the resulting Q. Second, we removed the bottom
3D→2D→3D branch to show UV coordinates ˆQ by performing nearest-neighbor matching between
P and ˆP. As illustrated in Figure 6, removing any of the two branches will cause different degrees of
performance degradation. Furthermore, we verified the necessity of Cut-Net in the whole learning
pipeline. As shown in Figure. 7, removing Cut-Net does not lead to obvious performance degradation
for models that are simpler to open (e.g., human-face and mobius-strip), yet for the other complex
models the removal of Cut-Net causes highly-distorted surface flattening. Without learning offsets,
the inherent smoothness of neural works can impede “tearing” the originally-continuous areas on the
3D surface, thus hindering the creation of cutting seams.

In addition, we conducted quantitative evaluations of self-intersection. Given a triangular mesh, we
check if any pair of triangles overlaps in the UV space, and then measure the proportion of overlapped
pairs to the total amount of triangle pairs. As reported in Table 4, self-intersection are inevitable both
in FAM and SLIM, but the proportions of self-intersected triangles are very small. In practice, it is not
hard to apply post-processing refinement to slightly adjust the distribution of UV coordinates to further
relieve or even eliminate self-intersection issues. For point cloud parameterization, we evaluated our
robustness to noises in Figure 8, where we can observe that FAM shows stable performances to noisy
input conditions (with 1%, 2%, and 4% Gaussian noises for point position perturbation).

Finally, we performed stress tests on a Hilbert-space-filling-shaped cylinder model in Figure 9a.
It is observed that our FAM obtains the basically optimal solution. Still, as shown in Figure 9b,
processing the highly-complicated ShapeNet-style CAD model with rich interior structures and many
multi-layer issues shows inferior UV unwrapping quality. Although our learned cutting seams are
generally reasonable and texture mapping looks relatively regular from outside, it is hard to deal with
the complicated interior structures.

Conclusion

We proposed FAM, the first neural surface parameterization approach targeted at global free-boundary
parameterization. Our approach is universal for dealing with different geometric/topological complex-
ities regardless of mesh triangulation quality and even applicable to unstructured point clouds. More
importantly, our approach automatically learns appropriate cutting seams along the target 3D surface,
and adaptively deforms the 2D UV parameter domain. As an unsupervised learning framework, our
FAM shows significant potentials and practical values. The current technical implementations still
have several aspects of limitations. Our working mode of per-model overfitting cannot exploit existing
UV unwrapping results (despite their limited amounts) as ground-truths for training generalizable
neural models. Besides, a series of more advanced properties, such as shape symmetry, cutting seam
visibility, seamless parameterization, have not yet been considered.

Implementation Details

In our bi-directional cycle mapping framework, all sub-networks are architecturally built upon stacked
MLPs without batch normalization. We uniformly configured LeakyReLU non-linearities with the
negative slope of 0.01, except for the output layer. Within the Deform-Net, ξ′
d and ξ′′
d are four-layer
MLPs with channels [2, 512, 512, 512, 64] and [66, 512, 512, 512, 2]. Within the Wrap-Net, ξ′
w and
ξ′′
w are four-layer MLPs with channels [2, 512, 512, 512, 64] and [66, 512, 512, 512, 6]. Within the
Cut-Net, ξ′
c and ξ′′
c are three-layer MLPs with channels [3, 512, 512, 64] and [67, 512, 512, 3]. Within
the Unwrap-Net, ξu is implemented as three-layer MLPs with channels [3, 512, 512, 2]. In addition
to network structures, there is also a set of hyperparameters to be configured and tuned. As presented
in Eqn. (8) for cutting seam extraction, we chose Kcut = 3. Suppose that, at the current training
iteration, the side length of the square bounding box of 2D UV coordinates Q is denoted as L(Q).
Then we set the threshold Tcut to be 2% of L(Q). Besides, as presented in Eqn. (9) for computing the
unwrapping loss, we choose the threshold as ϵ = 0.2 · L(Q)/
√

N, and Ku = 8. When formulating
the overall training objective, the weights for ℓunwrap, ℓwrap, ℓcycle, and ℓconf are set as 0.01, 1.0,
0.01, and 0.01. All our experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.

Discussions about Global and Multi-Chart Surface Parameterization

Over the years, global surface parameterization has continuously been the mainstream direction of
research, since it potentially achieves smooth transitions and uniform distribution of mapping distor-
tion across the entire surface, while multi-chart parameterization typically introduces discontinuities
along patch boundaries, causing more obvious visual artifacts for texture mapping (perhaps the most
important application scenario in the graphics field) and bringing additional difficulties in many other
shape analysis tasks (e.g., remeshing, morphing, compression). For multi-chart parameterization, it
is worth emphasizing that only obtaining chart-wise UV maps is not the complete workflow. We
need to further perform chart packing to compose the multiple UV domains, without which the actual
usefulness can be largely weakened. However, packing is known as a highly non-trivial problem,
which is basically skipped in recent neural learning approaches, such as DiffSR and Nuvo. Still, local
parameterization does have its suitable application scenarios for processing highly-complicated sur-
faces such as typical ShapeNet-style CAD meshes with rich interior structures and severe multi-layer

issues, and per-chart distortion can be reduced since the geometry and topology of cropped surface
patches become simpler.

A.3
Comparison with SLIM on Non-Disk-Type Surfaces with Manually-Specified Cuts

In the main manuscript, our experimental comparisons with SLIM focus on 3D models with open
boundaries and/or disk topologies, on which SLIM can be applied. Here, we made additional efforts
to conduct comparisons with SLIM on the non-disk-type 3D surface model of nefertiti by manually
specifying an optimal cutting seam for SLIM to run. Note that this is a quite unfair experimental
setting, because finding optimal cuts is known to be a critical yet complicated task. As illustrated in
Figure 10, our approach still achieves highly competitive performances compared with SLIM even
under such an unfair comparison setup.

A.4
Running Efficiency

In addition to parameterization quality, we further compared the time costs of our FAM and SLIM for
training and optimization. Here, the official code of SLIM runs on the Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700
CPU. Table 5 lists the time costs for different testing models. Note that, since our FAM operates on
surface-sampled points and we uniformly used the same number of input points (i.e., N), the time
costs of our FAM basically maintain unchanged for different testing models. It turns out that our
approach achieves satisfactory learning efficiency.

A.5
Comparison with Nuvo [36]

We provided typical parameterization results of Nuvo using a third-party implementation available
at https://github.com/ruiqixu37/Nuvo, as presented in Figure 11. We can observe that its
chart assignment capability is still not stable. It often occurs that some spatially-disconnected surface
patches are assigned to the same chart. Moreover, the critical procedure of chart packing is actually
ignored in Nuvo. Directly merging the rectangular UV domains is not a valid packing. A real-sense
packing should adaptively adjust the positions, poses, and sizes of each UV domain via combinations
of translation, rotation, and scaling.

A.6
Comparison with OptCuts [16]

We provided typical parameterization results of OptCuts, as presented in Figure 12. Comparatively,
our neural parameterization paradigm still shows advantages in terms of flexibility (not limited to
well-behaved meshes; applicable to point clouds), convenience (exploiting GPU parallelism; much
easier for implementing and tuning), and parameterization smoothness (not limited to mesh vertices).
Although OptCuts is able to jointly obtain reasonable surface cuts and UV unwrapping results, its
performances are generally sub-optimal compared with ours.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract clearly indicates the contribution and advantages of our proposed
novel neural surface parameterization approach.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations of our current technical implementations are analyzed in the
end of Section 5. Efficiency is also compared in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

16


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper is not a theoretical work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The experimental setups and detailed technical implementations have been
presented in the main manuscript and the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

17


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Although the code is not uploaded for now, we have explicitly claimed in the
Abstract that our code will be publicly available.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have detailedly introduced our technical implementations in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Not applicable to our surface parameterization setup, which overfits for each
given 3D model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The specific types of GPU and CPU are reported in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We conform all the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There is no societal impact of our technical exploration of surface parameteri-
zation as a classic geometry processing task.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

19


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work has no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We did not use existing assets that need to be particularly credited/mentioned.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

20


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
