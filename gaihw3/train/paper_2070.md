Abstract

While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches
still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various
scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality
degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various
combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator
known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel
attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from
conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly
enhance the model’s robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we
evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple
models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the
instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the
above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and
real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete
with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit’s impressive performance
on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path
for future research within the fashion community.

Introduction

The dramatic success of e-commerce is steadily demanding a more convenient and personalized
customer shopping experience. Among them, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) (23; 47; 22) has
emerged as a promising topic in the research community and witnesses rapid advancements (15; 24;
18), whose task is to fit the target garment to the human body with various gestures. However, current
methodologies do not meet the high-fidelity and robustness required in real-world applications, often
resulting in artifacts or the mismatch of clothing details. Furthermore, the support for a variety of
try-on combinations of attire (10) remains an area of ongoing research.

Most prior methodologies (6; 14) utilize a separate warping module to align garments on the human
body, subsequently employing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (19) for their integration.
This explicit warping process typically yields overly smooth garment transformations and struggles
to cope with complex poses and occlusions. (50). While some diffusion-based methods (58; 50)
leverage pre-trained diffusion models (43), with structures akin to ReferenceNet (26) to preserve
fine-grained garment information; However, these methods encounter difficulties in producing vivid
fabric textures and photorealistic lighting and shadows. They also show artifacts in cross-category
try-ons, diminishing their inherent text-image capacity when applied to specialized tasks as depicted
in Fig. 4. In summary, existing methods still fall short in producing images of high fidelity that exhibit
clothing styles rendered with exceptional detail and true-to-life accuracy across scenes. Moreover,
these methods are designed solely for trying on individual items of clothing and do not support
multi-conditions, thereby failing to facilitate the free combination of tops and bottoms.

As discussed above, we believe that an ideal VTON workflow should exhibit the following properties:

• Scalability. The ultimate goal of the VTON model is to enable any free and customizable
virtual outfit combination of multiple garments (57). It should support multi-condition
injection, allowing for easy expansion to more applications, such as mixing and matching
tops and bottoms, layering inner and outer garments, etc.

• Robustness. Given the diverse scenarios encountered in e-commerce settings (13), the
VTON model should generate authentic fabric textures and natural lighting, reproducing the
details of the target clothing (e.g., logos, patterns, texts and strips) stably and accurately.

We present the following critical contributions to establish AnyFit as a novel VTON paradigm, which
adeptly addresses the challenge of any combination of attire across any conceivable scenario, in
Fig. 1. AnyFit mainly consists of two isomorphic U-Nets, namely HydraNet and MainNet. The
former is tasked with extracting fine-grained clothing features, while the latter is responsible for
generating try-ons. (1) Scalability: A hallmark of AnyFit is its innovative introduction of the
Hydra Encoding Block that only parallelizes attention matrices within a sharing HydraNet, enabling
effortless expansion to any quantity of conditions with only 8% increase in parameters for each
additional branch. The proposal of parallelizing these blocks is built on the insight that only the
self-attention layers are crucial for implicit warping (50), while the remaining components primarily
serve as generic feature extractors. We further invent Hydra Fusion Block to seamlessly integrate the
features of Hydra Encoding into MainNet, with positional embeddings to distinguish encodings from
different sources. It is important to note that ReferenceNet (26; 9) or GarmentNet (50) could be seen
as specific instances of HydraNet when limited to a single condition. (2) Robustness: Observations
indicate a noticeable reduction in the robustness and quality of images generated by existing Virtual
Try-On (VTON) works, in comparison to the original stable diffusion performances. Inspired by
discussions in the community (2), we present the Prior Model Evolution strategy. This innovative
approach involves merging parameter variations within a model family (e.g., a collection of fine-tuned
versions of SDXL (41)), enabling the independent evolution of multiple capabilities of the base model.
This strategy emerges as an intuitively logical and highly effective method for amplifying the model’s
innate potential prior to training. This is particularly relevant when contending with the significant
escalation in training costs associated with dual U-Nets—an aspect that is overlooked in previous
research. Furthermore, we introduce the Adaptive Mask Boost to further enhance the fit of the attire
as a bonus. It requires length augmentation of parsing-free mask regions during the training phase,
allowing the model to autonomously understand the overall shape of the clothing, which emancipates
the model from previous reliance on hints of masks derived from garments. During inference, we
adapt the shape of the mask area based on the aspect ratio of the target garment, thereby markedly
encouraging the generation of well-fitted try-ons, particularly for long garments (e.g., windbreaker).

To the best of our knowledge, AnyFit stands as a pioneering VTON method to fulfill scalability
and robustness requirements. Our innovative HydraNet and Prior Model Evolution strategies have
the potential to transform not just the domain of VTON, but to catalyze advancements across a
broader spectrum of conditional generation applications. Finally, we have carried out comprehensive
experiments on try-on benchmarks (12; 16) and engaged in challenging validation using in-the-wild
sets. These experiments demonstrate that our model shows exceptional performance that eclipses
current methods by a substantial margin, in terms of garment fidelity and robustness when addressing
street-captured scenarios. In addition, our method has realized a formidable capability for multi-
garment try-ons, culminating in results that exhibit strikingly harmonized upper and lower styles.

Related works

GAN-based virtual try-on. The virtual try-on task is concerned with synthesizing images of a person
donning the designated garment with appropriate fit (23), while retaining salient characteristics of the
original garment and person, given a pair of images depicting a person and a target garment. To execute
this task, numerous works (17; 30; 34; 6; 14; 22) have utilized Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) (19) with two-stage strategy (35; 18; 52): (1) warping the clothing to the desired shape (7; 36)
and (2) fusing the deformed clothing via try-on generator based on GAN. HR-VITON (35) conducts
both warping and segmentation concurrently to address issues related to body occlusion and misfit of
garments. GP-VTON (49) introduces localized warping along with global parsing to independently
simulate the deformation of different regions of clothing, aiming to achieve a more form-fitting
result. However, these existing approaches that rely on an explicit warping module are incapable of
supplementing the sides of the clothing and the natural lighting and shadows (50).

Diffusion-based virtual try-on. As significant progress in Text-to-Image diffusion models (25; 39;
27; 11) is witnessed in recent years, some works (10) have been motivated to incorporate pre-trained
diffusion models (43; 41) as priors into virtual try-on task. LADI-VTON (38) and DCI-VTON (20)
explicitly deform the clothing to achieve pixel-level alignment with the human body, followed by
a diffusion model to blend the clothing with the human body as refinement. StableVITON (31)
introduces an end-to-end approach that injects intermediate feature maps from a spatial encoder
into the U-Net decoder via a zero cross-attention block, akin to the ControlNet (55) structure. Most
recently, OOTDiffusion (50) and IDM (13) achieve garment feature extraction with a parallel U-
Net and feed them through self-attention for enhanced integration. Unfortunately, these methods
intrinsically lack support for try-ons that involve multiple garments. Moreover, they exhibit artifacts
and unstable garment fits for arbitrary images, which leads to a degradation of performance on
out-of-distribution images in complex backgrounds and poses.

Model overview
An overview of the AnyFit is presented in Fig. 2. The backbone of AnyFit employs the SDXL (43),
with the preliminary detailed in Appendix C.2. Given a human image xh ∈RH×W ×3 and a target
garment image xg ∈RH×W ×3, AnyFit is aimed to generate an authentic try-on image xtr. We
employ OpenPose (8; 53) to obtain clothing-agnostic mask xm and masked person image xag

---Page Break---
adjusting for the size of different garments, as detailed in Sec. 3.3. We treat VTON as a specific case
of image inpainting (51), endeavoring to fill the masked person xag with the cloth xg. The main
inpainting U-Net (MainNet) inputs 3 concatenated components with 9 channels: the noisy image zt,
the latent agnostic image E(xag) and the resized agnostic mask xm, where E(·) represents VAE (32)
encoding. A Pose Guider (26) with 4 convolution layers (4 × 4 kernels, 2 × 2 strides, 16, 32, 64, 128
channels) is incorporated to align the pose image E(xp) with noise zt.

Scalability: To preserve the fine details of the clothing, as well as to support both single and
multiple garment VTONs, we employ a HydraNet that mirrors the MainNet in encoding clothing
information. It shares the same weight initialization as the MainNet and innovatively parallelizes
attention metrics based on the number of conditions to create Hydra Encoding Blocks for different
conditional encodings. Robustness: During training, issues such as mask information leakage and
quality degradation were observed. To address these issues, we adopt Adaptive Mask Boost and Prior
Model Evolution, respectively, which significantly bolster the model’s robustness across different
scenarios cost-effectively and straightforwardly.

3.2
HydraNet for multi-condition VTON

HydraNet. Inspired by successful practice in human editing (26; 9), we introduce a garment encoding
network isomorphic to the main generative network (MainNet), that precisely preserves the details
of clothing. When dealing with multi-garment VTON, a direct method might involve replicating
multiple garment encoding nets to manage different conditions. This approach, however, would
lead to a significant increase in the number of parameters, rendering it computationally prohibitive.
Experimentally we discover that for conditions with similar content (such as different types of
clothing), the self-attention module plays a vital role in the latent warping of the garments, aligning
them with the locations requiring inpainting. Conversely, other network architectures, which typically
tasked with general feature extraction, can be shared across different condition encoding branches
without compromising the model’s performance. In view of this, we innovatively propose HydraNet
for multi-condition encoding. It operates based on a shared Unet structure, while parallelizing the
attention modules according to the number of input conditions, thereby constructing Hydra Encoding
Blocks. Specifically, we parallelize the self-attention matrices with identical initial weights, and feed
the multi-condition key and value features

zi
hk, zi
hv
	
into MainNet, which encode the fine-grained
details of the clothing. It’s notable that ReferenceNet (26; 9) or GarmentNet (50) could be seen as
specific instances of HydraNet limited to a single condition. HydraNet requires only one forward
pass (timestep t = 0) to encode clothing before the multiple denoising steps in MainNet, with the
additional temporal and parameter overheads being minimal for each added condition, in Tab. 2.

Hydra Fusion. We propose a highly efficient and easily scalable Hydra Fusion Block to replace the
self-attention layers in MainNet, accomplishing the feature injection from HydraNet to MainNet for
any length via concatenation. Specifically, given the key and value features

zi
hk, zi
hv
	
∈Rb×l×c
from the HydraNet, we introduce learnable position embeddings to distinguish features from different
source conditions. The superscript i denotes different input conditions. Subsequently, we concatenate
the key and value along the l dimension to obtain the final

zall
hk, zall
hv
	
∈Rb×Nl×c as:

zall
hk = (z1
hk + PE1(z1
hk)) ⊕(z2
hk + PE2(z2
hk)) ⊕· · · ⊕(zN
hk + PEN(zN
hk)),
(1)

where N denotes the total number of input conditions, PE represents positional encoding, and
⊕signifies concatenation. zall
hv follows a similar formulation. Facing the key and value features
{zmk, zmv} ∈Rb×l×c from the MainNet and concatenated HydraNet features

zall
hk, zall
hv
	
, we once
again concatenate the corresponding features along the l dimension into {zck, zcv} ∈Rb×(N+1)l×c,
which are then used in subsequent attention calculations with zmq. It is noteworthy that, with
the lightweight design leveraging parallelization and concatenation, HydraNet can be effortlessly
extended to perform injections with any number of conditions, thereby possessing a more expansive
application potential within the domain of generative models.

Model evolution and mask boost for robust VTON

Prior Model Evolution. A diminution in image generation performance with the SDXL-inpainting
model compared to the SDXL base model is noted (1). We attribute this degradation to the disruption
of previously well-aligned correspondences between text and images during the inpainting pre-
training phase. Drawing inspiration from the open-source community (2), we develop a Prior Model

Evolution strategy, which enhances the model’s strength and adaptability in generating outfit images
at a very low cost, even without training. Specifically, we meticulously amalgamate the weights from
three distinct, powerful models to evolve the initial weights for our model. These models comprise:
SDXL-base-1.0 (41), SDXL-inpainting-0.1 (4) with inpainting capabilities, and DreamshaperXL
alpha2 (3), which demonstrates superior performance in generating clothing and human figures. Their
weights are denoted by Wbase, Winp, Wds. The evolution formula is as follows:

Wnew = Wbase + α · (Winp −Wbase)
|

}
Inpainting Increment

+ β · (Wds −Wbase)
|

(2)

where α and β are the balancing coefficients that account for the capability enhancements from
SDXL-inpainting and DreamshaperXL. It is important to note that we directly copy the extra 5
channels in the conv in layer of the SDXL-inpainting into the merged model, multiplying them by α.

However, the optimal values of α and β are not apparent. We hope to determine the optimal α and β
to ensure that the initial weight Wnew achieve the best evaluation performance, i.e.

arg min
(α,β)∈[0,2]2 f(α, β) = Φ (Wbase + α · (Winp −Wbase) + β · (Wds −Wbase)) ,
(3)

where Φ is a non-differentiable evaluation function. Empirically, we assume that f exhibits monotonic
or convex properties with respect to the balancing coefficients (α, β) in most regions. Therefore,
we discretize the continuous domain [0, 2]2 into a grid with δ = 0.1 as the step size and design the
discrete greedy algorithm 1, to search for the optimal (α, β). In our algorithm, we selecte the CLIP
score (42) on 20 fixed inpainting image-text pairs as the evaluation function Φ. The optimal solution
obtained is (α, β) = (1.0, 1.1). Please refer to the Appendix C.1 for more explanations.

Adaptive Mask Boost. Previous works gen-
erally exhibit limited robustness in cross-
category try-on scenarios, resulting in inac-
curately rendered clothing styles as shown in
Fig. 6 and 10. This is largely due to a depen-
dence on agnostic masks derived from cloth-
ing parsing, which tends to leak the edges
of the clothing shape during training. This
leakage may cause the generated garments to
almost entirely cover the agnostic mask re-
gion. In response to these limitations, we em-
ploy an intuitive and effective approach that
significantly enhances the model’s robustness
about cross-category try-on, i.e., the Adaptive
Mask Boost strategy, which primarily com-
prises mask augmentation during training and

5


---Page Break---
adaptive elongation during inference. Specifically, during training, the agnostic mask is extracted
solely using OpenPose body joint detections without leveraging human parsing. We perform random
elongation of the mask by a factor f ∼Uniform(1.2, 1.5) with a probability of P = 0.5. This training
setting forces the model to autonomously determine the optimal cloth length. During inference, we
assess the aspect ratio σ of the bounding box of the laid-out garment. If σ > 1.2, we proportionally
extend the agnostic area to match σ, creating an adaptive agnostic mask that conforms to the garment’s
style. Experiments have validated that AnyFit with Adaptive Mask Boost autonomously determines
the appropriate garment length, yielding robust try-on results across different clothing categories.

Experimental setup

Datasets. Our experiments are carried out on two publicly available datasets, VITON-HD (12)
(11647 training pairs) and DressCode (16) (48392 training pairs) using the official splits for training
and testing, as well as an additional proprietary e-commerce dataset. This proprietary dataset contains
50602 training pairs and 2500 testing pairs of mainly upper-body person and upper garment images,
featuring complex patterns, backgrounds, and postures, alongside a rich variety of styles including
layered garment ensembles, which present a more challenging scenario. As for multi-garment try-on,
we utilized a HumanParsing model (28; 29) to extract clothing items from DressCode and constructed
triplets consisting of (upper-body garment, lower-body garment, model image). In these triplets, one
garment is an original laid-out image, while the other is a cropped image from the person’s image.
Finally, we construct 24314 publicly available upper-lower triplets by garment crop from the 15363
upper-body pairs and 8951 lower-body pairs in DressCode, called DressCode-multiple. A subset of
1800 triplets is reserved as the test set. Please refer to the Appendix B for more details.

Implementation details. We initialize the AnyFit with Prior Model Evolution strategy described in
Sec. 3.3, and fine-tune it using an AdamW optimizer (37) with a constant learning rate of 5e −5. We
train three variants of models on the VITON-HD, DressCode and proprietary dataset at a resolution
of 1024 × 768, independently. Subsequently, we extend the model trained on DressCode to enable
multi-garment try-ons by training on the DressCode-multiple dataset. All the models are trained for
150 epochs on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with DeepSpeed (5) ZeRO-2 to reduce memory usage, at
a batch size of 15. At inference time, we run AnyFit on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU for 30
sampling steps with the DDIM sampler (44). Outfitting dropout (50) is used with a guidance scale
sg = 1.3. The data augmentation follows the same protocol as in StableVTON (31). We also employ
pretrained IP-Adapter (54) for SDXL. Please refer to the Appendix D for more details.

Evaluation protocols. We measure reconstruction accuracy by LPIPS (56) and SSIM (48) in a paired
setting provided ground truth images, and authenticity of unpaired synthesized images by FID (40)
and KID (45) without ground truth. All evaluations are conducted at a resolution of 512 × 384.

Baselines. We compare our model on single try-on tasks on VITON-HD, DressCode and our
proprietary dataset with previous baselines including HR-VTON (35), LADI-VTON (38), DCI-
VTON (20), StableVITON (31), OOTDiffusion (50), and the state of the art IDM (13). We directly
utilize their released pre-trained models. As for multi-garment try-on, we developed a two-stage IDM
model as a strong baseline, referred to as IDM-2Stage, which dresses the upper and lower garments
sequentially. Inspired by (10), we concatenate the upper and lower garments on width spatially and
feed them to a single-conditional HydraNet for training as another baseline, termed VTON-concat.
Finally, we compared AnyFit with Paint by Example (51), IDM-2Stage, and VTON-concat.

Qualitative results

Single-garment try-on. Fig.3 and 4 provide a qualitative comparison between AnyFit and the
baselines on VITON-HD, the more challenging proprietary and in-the-wild data, covering open-
garment and layering rendering scenarios. For a fair comparison with the baselines, we include
results of AnyFit trained on VITON-HD. AnyFit excels in retaining intricate pattern details, owing
to the effective collaboration between HydraNet and the IP-Adapter. It also maintains the correct
silhouette of the clothing at a semantic level. This suggests that, through Mask Boost, AnyFit
enhances the recollection of the original shape of the clothing, while other models, influenced by
the mask, tend to generate incorrect appearances. The Prior Model Evolution further strengthens
the texture representation of the apparel. Notably, when trained on the proprietary dataset, AnyFit
automatically fills in inner garments or unzips clothing based on posture, a capability absent in the
version trained on VITON-HD due to the lack of such training data.

Multi-garment try-on. Fig. 5 offers a qualitative comparison for multi-garment try-ons using the
compiled DressCode-multiple dataset. Firstly, AnyFit demonstrates high-fidelity cloth preserva-
tion. Importantly, thanks to the distinct and individual Hydra-Blocks situated in different condition
branches, AnyFit accurately depicts the demarcation between the upper and lower garments, show-
casing a reasonable transition at the interconnection. In contrast, VTON-concat mishandles the
relative clothing sizes after concatenation, leading to garment distortion and blurring. Meanwhile,
IDM-2Stage faces artifacts at the juncture of the upper and lower garments, because it obscures parts
of one garment while trying on another. Remarkably, despite training with one garment presented
as a flat lay image and the other as a warped cloth cropped from a person image, AnyFit remains
strikingly robust when faced with both garments presented as flat lays during inference.

4.3
Quantitative results

As indicated in Tab. 1 2 3, extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD (12), DressCode (16), the
proprietary dataset, and DressCode-multiple consistently prove that AnyFit significantly surpasses all
baselines. This confirms AnyFit’s capability to deliver superior try-on quality in both single-garment
and multi-garment tasks across various scenes. Moreover, we note that AnyFit shows considerable
improvement in unpaired settings in terms of the FID and KID metrics, demonstrating our model’s
robustness for cross-category try-ons. For more results, please refer to the Appendix E.

Hydra Blocks. To validate our proposed Hydra Blocks, we directly employ a singular conditioned
HydraNet (which degenerates to ReferenceNet (26) actually) as the baseline "w/o Hydra Block" to
encode both the top and bottom garment conditions concurrently, and then concatenate them into
MainNet. As illustrated in Tab. 4, Fig. 8 and 11, a model lacking the Hydra Block tends to produce
artifacts at the junction of the top and bottom garments. Such models also frequently allow the
features of one garment to influence the other, leading to incorrect clothing styles. However, with the
introduction of the Hydra Block, AnyFit consistently exhibits more stable results.

Prior Model Evolution. We qualitatively demonstrate the effects of the Prior Model Evolution in
Fig. 13 and 6 (a). The SDXL-evolved model reduces artifacts and enhances robustness significantly,
while outputs without Prior Model Evolution typically feature oversaturated colors as well as lighting
and shadows that do not harmonize with the background. The gradual enhancement of model
capabilities is visualized in Fig. 6(c). We also empirically and quantitatively validate the effectiveness

of the Prior Model Evolution strategy after training on the Virtual Try-On (VTON) task in Fig. 8 and
Tab. 4. The Prior Model Evolution, by improving the model’s initial capabilities, lessens the difficulty
of learning and fosters a dramatic improvement in outfitting capacity and logo fidelity.

Adaptive Mask Boost. We illustratively showcase the issues of information leakage and mask
reliance found in previous methods in Fig. 6 (b) and Fig. 10. Additionally, we empirically and
quantitatively validate the effectiveness of the Adaptive Mask Boost strategy in Table 4 and Fig. 10.
This strategy significantly heightens the model’s robustness towards different categories of clothing,
enabling the autonomous determination of appropriate garment length rather than relying on masks.
Furthermore, we manually adjust the aspect ratios σ in Fig. 6 (d), which demonstrates the positive
impact of adaptive elongation during inference. More ablation studies are detailed in the Appendix A.

Conclusion

We introduce AnyFit, a novel and robust VTON pipeline suitable for any combination of attire across
any imaginable scenario, offering a revolutionary leap in realistic try-on effects. To support multi-
garment try-ons, AnyFit constructs HydraNet with lightweight and scalable parallelized attention that
facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments. Observing artifacts in real-world scenarios, we
evolve its potential by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask
region boost strategy. Comprehensive experiments on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world
data have demonstrated that AnyFit significantly surpasses all baselines by a large gap.

Broader impacts. With the ability to synthesize images, arises the risk that AnyFit might be used for
inappropriate purposes such as producing media that breaches intellectual property rights or privacy
norms. Because of these risks, we strongly advocate for the conscientious use of this technology.

Limitation and future work. Our approach exhibits excellent performance in single-garment and
multi-garment virtual try-on applications. However, it still faces some limitations. Firstly, it shares
the shortcomings of large text-image models, sometimes showing instability in generating hands with
complex structures. Secondly, our model offers initial but not yet fully mature text control capabilities
(for details, please refer to the Appendix A), providing opportunities for future enhancements.

Appendix

In Section A, we provide more ablation studies about the role of text prompts in AnyFit, Hydra
Block, Adaptive Mask Boost strategy and Prior Model Evolution. In Section B, we provide additional
details about the proprietary dataset and the multi-garment VTON dataset. In Section C, we provide
additional details about discrete greedy algorithm during Prior Model Evolution, and preliminary
knowledge about stable diffusion. In Section D, we provide additional details about experimental
setup, including data augmentation and outfitting dropout. Lastly, in Section E, we present a multitude
of AnyFit generated images, including single-garment visual try-ons and multi-garment virtual try-ons,
with additional results displayed in challenging scenarios.

More ablation study

A.1
The role of text prompt in AnyFit

In fact, we have discovered that text plays a certain role in controlling the overall try-on style. As show
in Fig. 9, by adjusting the prompt, AnyFit is able to achieve variations in Virtual Try-On (VTON)
apparel styles. However, this form of control is unstable, leaving space for further exploration.

A.2
More ablation study about Adaptive Mask Boost strategy

The Adaptive Mask Boost strategy primarily comprises mask augmentation during training and
adaptive elongation during inference. The role of adaptive elongation has been thoroughly illustrated
in Fig. 6 in the main body, where it addresses the challenge of try-ons for long garments. Here, we
predominantly discuss the function of parsing-free mask augmentation during training.

Specific to the implementation, during training, the agnostic mask is extracted solely using OpenPose
body joint detections to occlude the original clothing, without leveraging human parsing, and random
elongation of the mask is performed. Consequently, the shape of the mask is correlated only with
the human pose and not with the clothing. The significance of this procedure lies in eliminating
the possibility of the mask leaking clothing information, ensuring that the model cannot cheat
from the shape of the mask. From Fig. 10, we observe that previous models often suffer from
leakage of clothing information, where the models tend to generate garments that fill the entire mask
areas. In real-world inference scenarios, it is challenging to provide an entirely accurate mask region.

methods often suffer from leakage of clothing information, where the model tends to generate
garments that fill the entire mask area, while AnyFit autonomously determines the correct length of
the garments, producing attractive try-on results.

In contrast, our model is free from this predicament. Through mask augmentation during training,
AnyFit autonomously determines the correct length of the garments, producing attractive try-on
results.

employs a singular conditioned HydraNet (which, in this scenario, degenerates to ReferenceNet) to
encode both the top and bottom garment conditions concurrently, and then injects them into MainNet.

As illustrated in Fig. 11, model lacking the Hydra Block is more prone to producing artifacts at the
junction of the top and bottom garments. They also tend to allow the features of the bottom garment
to influence the top, resulting in incorrect clothing styles, such as overly long tops or erroneous stripe
patterns. After equipped with the Hydra Block, AnyFit noticeably exhibits more stable results.

A.4
More ablation study about Prior Model Evolution

In the main body of the paper, we have demonstrated the effects of Prior Model Evolution. However,
we also notice that the capabilities of large-scale text-to-image models are closely related to the value
of their classifier-free guidance (CFG). For simplicity, in the main body of the paper, all images are
generated using a CFG value of 3.0 in Fig. 6 when discussing the comparisons related to Prior Model
Evolution. Here, we provide a more granular comparison concerning the presence or absence of the
Prior Model Evolution strategy. The results presented here are all based on models directly initialized
with synthetic weights, without any training.

As depicted in Fig. 13, an increase in the CFG value leads to a generalized oversaturation in the
images. Within a reasonable range of CFG values, models incorporating Prior Model Evolution
exhibit more realistic fabric textures and more plausible inpainting results. In contrast, outputs
without Prior Model Evolution typically feature oversaturated colors and the absence of detailed
wrinkles, as well as lighting and shadows that do not harmonize with the background. This illustrates
the SDXL-inpainting-0.1 (41) model diminishes the exemplary text-to-image capabilities of the
original SDXL-BASE model, resulting in more mediocre outcomes. We attribute this degradation
to the disruption of the previously well-aligned correspondences between text and images during
the inpainting pre-training phase. However, our model with Prior Model Evolution, significantly
ameliorates this issue, enhancing its overall robustness. We actually find that after a minimal amount
of fine-tuning, the model’s synthetic outputs become substantially more powerful.

B
Datasets

In this section, we provide a detailed description of the proprietary dataset and the multi-garment
VTON dataset, i.e., DressCode-multiple, which is constructed based on the publicly available
DressCode (16) dataset.

B.1
The proprietary dataset

Our proprietary dataset comprises 50,602 training image pairs and 2,500 testing pairs. Each pair
consists of a flat-laid garment image and a frontal upper body model image, with most model images
featuring complex backgrounds. The proprietary dataset is collected from e-commerce websites, with
attention paid to achieving a balanced distribution of clothing categories. We gathered apparel from
12 different categories, including both menswear and womenswear, across various seasons such as
spring, summer, autumn, and winter. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the person images display diverse
backgrounds. We standardized the image resolution to 1024x768 and conducted preprocessing on this
basis to test different models. This preprocessing involved using Densepose (21) and OpenPose (8)
to extract human features, employing the SAM (33) model to extract the main garment body, and
constructing the gnostic mask images, etc.

B.2
The DressCode-multiple dataset

To facilitate research on multi-garment virtual try-on, we require a dataset composed of image
triplets, each containing an upper garment image, a lower garment image, and a model image wearing
the corresponding garments. However, obtaining such data with strict alignment is challenging.
Leveraging the DressCode dataset (16), which includes upper and lower garment data as well as
full-body model images, we set out to construct the DressCode-multiple dataset, consisting of triplets,
as illustrated in Fig. 14. Assuming we start with the upper garment data, where we already have a
flat lay upper garment image and a model image wearing the corresponding upper garment, we use
human parsing techniques (28; 29) to roughly segment the lower garment portion and extract it from
the model image to serve as the corresponding lower garment image. At this point, the triplet consists
of (flat lay upper, cropped lower, model image). Similarly, triplets derived from the lower garment
data result in a composition of (cropped upper, flat lay lower, model image). Using this approach,
we construct 24,314 publicly available upper-lower triplets by cropping garments from the 15,363
upper-body pairs and 8,951 lower-body pairs for training. For testing, we take the flat-laid garments
from the upper and lower garment test sets, shuffle them, and combine them randomly, pairing them

20


---Page Break---
with the test models from the upper garment data to create (flat lay upper, flat lay lower, model image)
configurations for unpaired, real-world multi-garment virtual try-on tests. The paired testing is not
conducted due to the lack of ground truth triplets.

It is worth mentioning that our model has not encountered triplets in the form of (flat lay upper
garment, flat lay lower garment, model image) during training. However, it has already learned the
correct way to wear upper and lower garments through training on cropped images and demonstrates
good robustness. We believe that if real triplets consisting of (flat lay upper garment, flat lay lower
garment, model image) were available for training, the model would exhibit even better performance.

Method supplement

C.1
Discrete greedy algorithm

Our objective is to determine the optimal balancing coefficients α and β to ensure that the initial
weight Wnew achieve the best evaluation performance, i.e.
arg min
(α,β)∈[0,2]2 f(α, β) = Φ (Wbase + α · (Winp −Wbase) + β · (Wds −Wbase))

Note that the function Φ is non-differentiable, which precludes the use of gradient-based optimization
algorithms to find the minimum point. Empirically, we find that the evaluation function f exhibits
monotonic or convex properties with respect to the balancing coefficients (α, β) in most regions.
Therefore, we discretize the continuous domain [0, 2]2 into a grid with δ as the step size and design
the following algorithm, inspired by the greedy method, to search for the optimal (α, β).

Algorithm 2 Discrete greedy algorithm
Require: Evaluation function f, step size δ.

1: Initialize (α, β) ←(0.5, 0.5)
2: while True do
3:
fcurrent ←f(α, β)
4:
N ←{(α + δ, β), (α −δ, β), (α, β + δ), (α, β −δ)}
5:
N ←{(α′, β′) ∈N | 0 ≤α′ ≤2 and 0 ≤β′ ≤2}
▷Filter out-of-bound neighbors
6:
FN ←{f(α′, β′) | (α′, β′) ∈N}
▷Compute f values for valid neighbors
7:
if min(FN) ≥fcurrent then
8:
break
9:
else
10:
(α, β) ←arg min(α′,β′)∈N f(α′, β′)
11:
end if
12: end while
13: return (α, β)

In this algorithm, we initialize (α, β) at (0.5, 0.5). During each iteration, we calculate the evaluation
value f at the current point and four adjacent points in the directions up, down, left, and right. The
algorithm then updates the current point to the one with the minimum evaluation value among these
adjacent points. The termination condition of the algorithm is met when the evaluation values of all
neighbors are greater than that of the current point. This method can be viewed as a discrete version
of gradient descent method. Please note that under the assumption that f is a convex or monotonic
function, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimal solution within the discrete
parameter space.

C.2
Preliminary

Stable Diffusion.
Our AnyFit is an extension of Stable Diffusion (43), which is one of the most
commonly used latent diffusion models. Stable Diffusion employs a variational autoencoder (32)
(VAE) that consists of an encoder E and a decoder D to enable image representations in the latent
space. And a UNet ϵθ is trained to denoise a Gaussian noise ϵ with a conditioning input encoded by a
CLIP text encoder (42) τθ. Given an image x and a text prompt y, the training of the denoising UNet
ϵθ is performed by minimizing the following loss function:
LLDM = EE(x),y,ϵ∼N(0,1),t

where t ∈{1, ..., T} denotes the time step of the forward diffusion process, and zt is the encoded
image E(x) with the added Gaussian noise ϵ ∼N(0, 1) (i.e., the noise latent). Note that the
conditioning input τθ(y) is correlated with the denoising UNet by the cross-attention mechanism (46).

Experimental details

Data augmentation.
We have implemented data augmentation techniques that could potentially
enhance the model’s generalization ability as well as its color accuracy performance. Specifically, the
data augmentation operations include (a) horizontal flipping of images, (b) resizing garments and
human figures through padding (up to 10% of the image size), (c) randomly adjusting the image’s hue
within a range of -5 to +5, and (d) randomly adjusting the image’s contrast within a specified range
(between 0.8 and 1.2 times the original contrast). Each of these operations occurs independently with
a 50% probability. Moreover, these operations are simultaneously applied to both the garment and
model images.

Outfitting dropout.
Following the OOTDiffusion approach, we applied Outfitting Dropout, which
essentially acts as a form of image-conditioned classifier-free guidance. It enhances the contrast
and sharpness of the generated images. Specifically, during the training process of our MainNet, we
randomly drop the input garment latent as E(g) = ∅, where ∅∈R4×h×w refers to an all-zero latent.
In this way, the denoising UNet is trained both conditionally and unconditionally. Then at inference
time, we simply use a guidance scale sg ≥1 to adjust the strength of conditional control over the
predicted noise:

ˆϵθ(zt, ωθ′(E(g))) = ϵθ(zt, ∅) + sg · (ϵθ(zt, ωθ′(E(g))) −ϵθ(zt, ∅)).
(5)

In practice, we empirically set the outfitting dropout ratio to 10% in training, and the guidance scale
sg to 1.2 as default. We exclusively employ Outfitting Dropout within the Hydra Fusion Block
that bridges HydraNet and MainNet. We have observed that applying outfitting dropout elsewhere
introduces pixel-level artifacts.

Full comparison on the proprietary dataset

Due to space constraints, we have not presented quantitative comparisons on the proprietary dataset
in a paired setting within the main body of the paper; they are additionally reported in Tab. 5.
Furthermore, we showcase additional results in Fig. 15, which include outcomes from state-of-the-art
baselines and AnyFit trained on both the proprietary dataset and VITON-HD. Our method exhibits a
considerable lead in performance.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the claims made. And the claims
match theoretical and experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the limitations part in the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

27


---Page Break---
Justification: All theoretical results are accompanied by appropriate proofs and proper
citations. Every claim is substantiated by empirical evidence or supported by referenced
literature.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our contribution is a novel model architecture along with associated model en-
hancement strategies. All parameters and operational steps are detailed in the Experimental
Section and the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We utilized two open-source datasets in addition to one proprietary dataset.
Should our paper be accepted, we plan to make efforts to release a portion of the proprietary
data to the public. While the code for the paper is not open-sourced, we have provided
comprehensive instructions necessary for replication.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided all the training and test details. Please refer to the "Experi-
mental Setup" part in the main paper and other related sections in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We adhered to the common evaluation practices established by prior work in
our field. Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive. We
believe that the metrics reported in main paper prove the efficacy of the model we proposed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

29


---Page Break---
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the sufficient information on the computer resources for each
experiment in "Experimental Setup" part.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper fully conforms to the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to the broader impacts part in the main paper.

30


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper poses no risks for misuse.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We follow the instructions by the creators of each asset. We also cite the
original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

31


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.

32


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
