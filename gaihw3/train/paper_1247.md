Abstract

Tokenization is widely used in large language models because it significantly
improves performance. However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such
as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-
level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these
disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel
byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level
and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level
Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle
of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these
larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically
denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and
inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures
and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.

Introduction

Most language models are trained using tokenization, which partitions text into tokens that typically
consist of words or subwords. Tokenization is useful because it significantly decreases the inference
and training computational costs of large language models. However, tokenization also imposes
several disadvantages, including performance penalties for languages that are priortizes less by the
tokenizer [1–3]; increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks [4]; and worse character-level modeling
performance [5, 6], and additional model complexity.1

Recently, MegaByte [7], MambaByte [6], and more [8–12] have been proposed as new byte-level
autoregressive language models that model bytes instead of tokens. (See [13–21] for encoder and
encoder-decoder byte-level modeling.) To address the longer context size resulting from modeling
bytes instead of tokens, MegaByte uses multiscale modeling [22–24], while MambaByte uses Mamba
blocks [25] instead of Transformer blocks. But although MegaByte and MambaByte have been
shown to perform better than a standard byte-level Transformer, to our knowledge, no byte-level
autoregressive large language model architecture has been shown to match the performance of
tokenized models when controlling for compute costs.

In this work, we study the performance of byte-level and subword-level autoregressive models
when trained using a fixed compute budget. We measure the performance in terms of the cross
entropy (measured in bits-per-byte), which has been shown to be a strong predictor of down-stream
performance [26]. In addition to controlling for training compute, we also control for inference
compute costs (measured in FLOPs). We find that byte-level Transformer and MegaByte models
can require roughly 10 times more training FLOPs to achieve the same performance as a subword-

Figure 1: An overview of the SpaceByte architecture. The embedding, local transformer blocks, and
de-embedding (i.e. a layer norm and linear) are the standard Transformer decoder layers. SpaceByte
modifies the standard transformer by applying “global” transformer blocks only after certain bytes,
such as space characters. The intuition is that the first character of a word is typically the hardest
to predict; thus this positioning of the global blocks should make the best use of the global blocks
(which use a larger model dimension).

level Transformer. To close this substantial performance gap, we propose a new byte-level decoder
architecture: SpaceByte.

SpaceByte also utilizes multiscale modeling to improve efficiency by grouping bytes into patches.
But unlike MegaByte, which uses a fixed patch size, SpaceByte uses a simple rule to dynamically
partition the bytes into patches that are aligned with word and other language boundaries. Our
compute-controlled experiments show that this simple modification is crucial for performance,
allowing SpaceByte to outperform other byte-level architectures and roughly match the performance
of subword Transformers across a variety of text modalities.

Our experiments are performed on datasets consisting of English books, LaTeX formatted arXiv
papers, and open-source code. For other data modalities, SpaceByte with our simple patching rule
might not be as effective.

SpaceByte

The SpaceByte architecture is summarized in Figure 1. In a nutshell, SpaceByte can be thought
of as a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra “global” transformer blocks (with a larger
model dimension) inserted in the middle, which are only applied a fraction of the time. While the
MegaByte architecture applies the global transformer blocks every P ∼8 bytes, we hypothesize that
this fixed spacing hinders performance. Our intuition is that the first character of a word is typically
significantly harder to predict than the following characters. We therefore expect that performance
can be improved by applying the global blocks primarily at word boundaries.

Global Block Insertion Rule In this work, we consider a very simple rule to dynamically decide
when to apply the global blocks. We assume that the text bytes are encoded using the UTF-8 encoding.
We define a byte to be spacelike if the byte does not encode a letter, number, or UTF-8 continuation
byte2. We apply the global blocks after any spacelike byte that is not preceded by another spacelike
byte (and after any BOS token). See Figure 2 for examples.

The most common spacelike byte is the space character. Thus, the global blocks are applied most
frequently to predict the first character of a word, which we expect is the hardest character to predict
[27] in a given word. With fixed patch size (e.g. as in MegaByte), the global blocks are typically
inserted in the middle a word, which we expect is inefficient because predicting the rest of the word
could likely be more efficiently accomplished using the local blocks. We define continuation bytes to
be spacelike so that languages that do not use spaces between words can still benefit from the global
blocks between multi-byte characters (e.g. Chinese characters consists of three bytes in UTF-8).

2UTF-8 uses a variable number of bytes to encode a character. English letters or numbers consist of a single
byte. Characters that are encoded using multiple bytes are encoded using a leading byte (which is spacelike by
our definition) followed by one or more continuation bytes (which are not spacelike).

Figure 2: Examples of patch boundaries from datasets that we study. Spacelike bytes are underlined
and colored blue. Patches boundaries are drawn above the text. Each patch ends after a spacelike
byte that is not preceded by another spacelike byte. Consequently, each patch begins with zero or
more spacelike bytes, followed by one or more non-spacelike bytes, and ends with a single spacelike
byte. The global blocks predict the first character of each patch. The downward arrow (↓) denotes a
newline byte. The left and right quotation characters, (“) and (”) in the PG-19 example, are encoded
using three bytes in UTF-8. The first of the three bytes is spacelike, while the later two bytes are
UTF-8 continuation bytes, which are not spacelike and are each denoted using a bullet point (•) above.

Although this very simple “spacelike” rule is likely not the optimal rule, we find that it works
surprisingly well in practice for English text, LaTeX formatted papers, and code. Nevertheless,
a critical future direction is to optimize [28, 14, 9] better rules using data rather than our simple
heuristic.

Important Details Since the global blocks are not applied as often as the local transformer blocks, it
is advantageous to use a larger model dimension for the global transformer blocks. To increase the
dimensions of an activation vector before the global blocks, we simply pad the activation vector with
zeros. To decrease the dimension, we truncate the activation vector.

In our experiments, we use a significantly larger context size than the model dimension Dlocal of the
local transformer blocks. To prevent the attention mechanism from dominating the compute costs for
the local model, we use an attention window [29–31] of length Dlocal for the local transformer blocks.
The global blocks use a global attention that attends to all other global blocks.

See Appendix C for pseudocode. Additional details specific to our experiments are provided in
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 and Appendix A.

Related Work

The most straight-forward consequence of modeling bytes instead of subword tokens is that the length
of a sequence typically increases by about a factor of four. This increased sequence length increases
the training and inference compute cost for modeling a given long sequence of text for a Transformer
due to the quadratic scaling of attention.

MegaByte The MegaByte architecture strives to use multiscale Transformer modeling to lessen these
performance issues. In particular, MegaByte groups bytes into patches of a fixed patch size P. Each
patch of bytes is vectorized and then fed into a “global” Transformer model. The output of the global
model is then fed into a “local” Transformer model that autoregressively outputs byte-level logits. [7]

For a context size of T bytes, MegaByte’s global Transformer model compresses the context into only
T/P patches, which can significantly decrease the compute cost for modeling long sequences. Similar
to Yu et al. [7], we also find that MegaByte outperforms a standard byte-level Transformer. However,
we find that MegaByte’s performance is remarkably close to a stronger byte-level Transformer
baseline that simply uses a sliding window attention mechanism [29–31] to increase the context size
without increasing the compute costs.

Yu et al. [7] do not compare MegaByte to subword-level Transformer in compute controlled
experiments.
In our compute controlled experiments, we find that MegaByte’s performance
significantly lags behind a subword-level Transformer.

Compared to MegaByte, SpaceByte makes the crucial change that patches are dynamically sized to be
commensurate with the text, e.g. with word boundaries. We also add an additional local model before
the global model (while MegaByte only utilizes a single local model after the global model) to help
the model deal with the dynamical patch sizes. We also use significantly longer attention windows
for our local models. We find that these changes allow SpaceByte to significantly improve upon the
performance of MegaByte and roughly match the performance of subword-level Transformers.

MambaByte The MambaByte architecture [6] takes an alternative approach to avoiding the quadratic
compute scaling of the attention mechanism by replacing the Transformer block with a Mamba block
[25]. Wang et al. [6] find that their byte-level MambaByte models outperform byte-level Transformer
and byte-level MegaByte models. They perform one controlled experiment with a subword model,
where they find that MambaByte slightly outperforms Mamba (using tokens) when controlling for the
amount of model parameters and training data (which was 14 epochs of the PG-19 dataset). But this
experiment was not controlled for compute as MambaByte was trained using roughly four times as
much compute than Mamba. We view the Mamba and MambaByte architectures as complementary
to our work, as the Mamba block could be integrated into SpaceByte (or MegaByte) in place of
Transformer blocks.

Layer Skipping SpaceByte could be though of as a Transformer that employs a novel kind of
text-dependent layer skipping [32–38] on the middle layers.

Word Boundary Prior works have shown utility in using word boundaries to partition patches
for autoregressive multi-scale byte-level modeling [9, 8, 11] (and also [18] for encoder-decoder
modeling). However, these works did not compare autoregressive byte-level models to subword-
level models, nor did they identity a patch partitioning rule that could generically be applied to
UTF-8 encoded text. Our primary contributions beyond these prior works is to show how to scale
word-boundary byte-level modeling to more diverse text modalities while roughly matching the
performance of subword-level models in compute-controlled experiments.

Nawrot et al. [9] and Fleshman and Van Durme [11] make use of the Hourglass Transformer
architecture [23]. The SpaceByte architecture is similar to the Hourglass Transformer, except
SpaceByte uses a simpler technique for shortening and upscaling the activations before and after the
global blocks, and SpaceByte uses a sliding window attention [29–31] in the local blocks to improve
performance for long context sizes.

Experiment Setup

Our experiments compare the performance of our byte-level SpaceByte architecture to subword-
level Transformer and byte-level Transformer and MegaByte architectures. To fairly compare the
performance between the byte and subword level models, we measure the cross-entropy of the test
dataset in terms of bits-per-byte.3 Given the substantial variation in inference compute costs across
the models we study, we also compare their inference compute costs to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation. We use FLOPs-per-byte as a simple software and hardware–independent proxy for
inference compute costs, which is the number of FLOPs (see Appendix A.1) required to model a byte
of text.4

Note that by controlling for both total training compute and FLOPs-per-byte, we are also controlling
for the amount of training data since (bytes trained) = (training FLOPs)/(training FLOPs-per-byte).
The FLOPs-per-byte during training is equal to three times the FLOPs-per-byte during inference (due
to the backwards pass during training).

3The bits-per-byte (BPB) is equal to BPB = XE Ntokens/(Nbytes ln 2), i.e. the cross entropy per token (XE)
times the number of tokens per byte (Ntokens/Nbytes) divided by ln 2 (to convert nats to bits). Ntokens and Nbytes
are the number of tokens and bytes in the dataset, respectively. For byte-level models, Ntokens = Nbytes since
bytes are used in place of tokens.
4We note that in order for memory bandwidth to not be a bottleneck during inference, the batch size must be
sufficiently large and e.g. grouped-query attention [39, 40] must be used.

We therefore study the Pareto frontier of lowest bits-per-byte and lowest FLOPs-per-byte. We train
all models using a compute-controlled setup, using either 1018 or 1019 FLOPs. In order to effectively
explore this Pareto frontier, we train models using a grid of different model dimensions and numbers
of layers, as specified in Appendix B.3.

Datasets Following the MegaByte [7] and MambaByte [6] experiments, we benchmark our models
on a diverse range of long-form datasets: PG-19 (English-language books written before 1919) [41];
arXiv (papers from ArXiv written in LaTeX, extracted from the arXiv component of The Pile [42]);
and Github (open-source code repositories, extracted from the Github component of The Pile [42]).

4.1
Models

The models we study tend to perform best when the compute cost is roughly evenly split between the
attention and feedforward layers. To ensure this, we fix the context size (or attention window) to be
equal to the model dimension for every layer. We detail our model setup below.

Notation For all models, we use T to denote the context length, and D to be the model dimension
(of the global model for SpaceByte and MegaByte).

For SpaceByte and MegaByte, Dlocal is the dimension of the local model, and Tglobal is the maximum
context size for the global model. The patch size P is the number of bytes between global blocks. If
the patch size is fixed (which is always the case for MegaByte), we naturally set the context size to be
T = PTglobal.

Below, we describe each of the model architectures that we compare in our experiments.

SpaceByte We fix the global context size and global model dimension to be equal, Tglobal = D, and
we set the local attention window Wlocal equal to the local model dimension, Wlocal = Dlocal. For
the PG-19 and arXiv datasets, the average patch size is roughly 6, so we take T = 6Tglobal for these
datasets; for the Github dataset, the average patch size is roughly 8, so we instead take T = 8Tglobal
for the Github dataset.

For simplicity, we fix the number of global transformer blocks Lglobal to be equal to the total number
of local blocks, L(1)
local + L(2)
local, and we evenly split the number of local blocks before (L(1)
local) and after
(L(2)
local) the global blocks, i.e. we fix L(1)
local = L(2)
local = 1

2Lglobal.

SpaceByte (fixed patches) To clearly demonstrate the utility of dynamically aligning patch
boundaries in SpaceByte, we also train a simplified version SpaceByte where the patches all have a
fixed size. In order to roughly match SpaceByte’s average patch size, we take the fixed patch size
to be P = 6 for all datasets except for the Github dataset, for which we use P = 8. We again use
Tglobal = D and T = PTglobal.

Byte-level Transformer For a simple baseline comparison (following Yu et al. [7]), we train byte-
level Transformer models. We take the context size to be equal to the model dimension, T = D.

Note that in our setup, a Transformer with model dimension D only sees a context size of D, which
is significantly smaller than the context size of PD for SpaceByte (and MegaByte) with patch size P.

Byte-level Transformer (Window Attention) Since a shorter context is a significant disadvantage
for long-form datasets, we also compare against a stronger Transformer baseline that uses a sliding
window attention [29–31] to efficiently increase the context size without increasing compute costs.
We train each window attention enhanced Transformer using a context size T = PD and a sliding
attention window size equal to D, with P = 6 for all datasets except for the Github dataset for which
P = 8.5

MegaByte We also compare to MegaByte [7]. Although MegaByte was originally trained using a
patch size of P = 8, we found that a patch size of P = 4 was often better in our setup. We thus
include both of these patch sizes (4 and 8) in our hyperparameter grid for MegaByte. For simplicity,
we fix the number of layers in the global and local blocks to be equal, Lglobal = Llocal, which is close

5We also tried a simplified Sparse Transformer [30] where the first attention layer uses a sliding attention
window of size D; the second attention layer uses a strided attention with stride P; and the remaining layers
continue to alternate between sliding and strided attention. However in our setup, we found this to perform
worse than just using a sliding window attention.

Subword Transformers Our most important baseline is the standard subword Transformer. We train
subword Transformers using two different tokenizers (both with a vocabulary size of 50,257): (1) the
GPT2 tokenizer [43], and (2) a SentencePiece [44] tokenizer using a byte-pair-encoding model [45]
that was separately trained for each dataset. As usual, we set the context size to be equal to the model
dimension, T = D.

4.2
More Details

We use fairly standard Pre-LN [46, 30, 47] Transformer [48] blocks with no bias terms. Since
MegaByte uses Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) [49], we also use RoPE for all models (which
slightly improves the loss). To prevent loss divergences during training, we use qk-layernorm [50–52]
(which we strongly recommend) for all models; i.e. we add an extra layer-normalization to the query
and key vectors in the self-attention layers.

All hyperparameters have been carefully tuned using grid and random searches. See Appendices A
and B for more details.6

Results

We now present our experimental data comparing the different model architectures in compute-
controlled settings. Figure 3 plots the Pareto frontier of lowest cross-entropy bits-per-byte and lowest
FLOPs-per-byte (i.e. inference compute cost) for each architecture and training compute budget.
We assume that the Pareto frontier is convex. Thus, for each architecture and compute budget, we
perform a grid search over model dimension and number of layers; we then draw a piecewise-linear
line connecting the best (i.e. minimal subset of) models such that all other models (not shown in
figure) lie above and to the right of the line. Table 1 summarizes the results for the lowest overall
bits-per-byte for each architecture.

Across all datasets, training compute budgets, and inference compute budgets (i.e. FLOPs-per-byte),
SpaceByte significantly outperforms all other byte-level architectures. SpaceByte also consistently
outperforms the subword Transformer when using GPT2 tokens, and by a wide margin on the
arXiv and Github datasets. SpaceByte roughly matches the performance of the most competitive
baseline, the subword Transformer using the SentencePiece tokenizer, with SpaceByte performing
slightly better on the arXiv and Github datasets. Figure 3 also suggests that SpaceByte’s performance
improves faster than the subword Transformer as the training compute budget increases.

Byte-level architectures other than SpaceByte perform significantly worse than SpaceByte or the
SentencePiece Transformer.
For example, for PG-19, the next best byte-level architecture is

MegaByte; however, MegaByte trained using 1019 FLOPs (thick green line in Figure 3a) performs
worse across nearly the entire Pareto frontier than the SentencePiece Transformer trained using only
10% as many training FLOPs (thin black line). Although the standard byte-level transformer (which
is the primary baseline used by Yu et al. [7], blue in Figure 3) performs significantly worse than
the other byte-level models, we note that by simply using a sliding window attention mechanism
to increase the context size to more closely match that of the other byte-level models, this stronger
baseline (purple) performs almost as well as MegaByte. Nevertheless, SpaceByte still significantly
outperforms this stronger baseline.

To verify the importance of dynamic patch sizes for SpaceByte’s performance, we compare SpaceByte
to a variant of SpaceByte with fixed patch sizes (orange in Figure 3). We observe that fixing the patch
size significantly degrades the performance of SpaceByte.

Note that on the arXiv and Github datasets, the subword Transformer performs significantly worse
when using GPT2 tokens (which were trained on WebText [43]) than SentencePiece tokens (which
were trained using the specific dataset). This exemplifies the bias that tokenization can introduce on
data distributions different from what the tokenizer was trained on.

Comparison with Other Works

We also compare SpaceByte performance to byte-level models trained in other works. Yu et al. [7]
trained Transformer, PerceiverAR, and MegaByte models, each using the same amount of compute,
FLOPs-per-byte, and data (80B bytes). Wang et al. [6] additionally trained a MambaByte model using
the same FLOPs-per-byte but only 30B bytes of data. We train SpaceByte-793M+184M (D = 1536,
Dlocal = 768, Llocal = 26, Lglobal = 28) using roughly the same inference FLOPs-per-byte (728M)
but also only 30B bytes of data (following Wang et al. [6]). Training these models thus requires
roughly 3 × 728M FLOPs-per-byte × 30B bytes ≈6.5 × 1019 FLOPS, where the factor of three
comes from converting inference FLOPs-per-byte to training FLOPs-per-byte (which additionally
requires a backwards pass). For this experiment, we set the context size of SpaceByte to 8192 bytes
to follow the prior works. See Appendix A for more details.

We also train subword Transformer-1B (D = 1536) models using the SentencePiece tokenizer (except
for the Stories dataset, for which we use the GPT2 tokenizer). The average number of bytes per token

for the PG-19, Stories, arXiv, and Github datasets are 4.05, 4.39, 3.73, and 3.31, respectively. To
match the FLOPs-per-byte of the subword Transformer-1B models to the byte-level models, we set
the number of layers to 40, 44, 37, or 31, for Transformer-1B on these four respective datasets.

Results are shown in Table 2. We show experiments for the PG-19 [41], Stories [53], arXiv (extracted
from The Pile [42]), and Github (extracted from The Pile [42]) datasets.7 Yu et al. [7] used proprietary
“arXiv” and “Code” datasets, which we do not have access to. Following Wang et al. [6], we compare
Yu et al. [7]’s results to the similar (but likely slightly different) arXiv and Github components of
The Pile [42]. However, Wang et al. [6] use their own test splits to evaluate MambaByte-353M on
Stories, arXiv, and Github. Due to the rather small test splits (∼100MB for the arXiv and Github
datasets), this difference can be significant. For example, the validation (and test) bits-per-byte for
SpaceByte-793M+184M on the Stories, arXiv, and Github datasets are 0.877 (0.833), 0.658 (0.663)
and 0.397 (0.411), which differ by +5%, −1%, and −3%, respectively. Given this variation, the
bits-per-byte of MambaByte-353M and SpaceByte-793M+184M are not statistically different on the
arXiv or Github datasets.

Overall, we find that SpaceByte outperforms the byte-level models trained in other works. SpaceByte
outperforms MegaByte, even though MegaByte was trained using 2.7 times as much compute and
data. Moreover, SpaceByte’s performance is competitive with the subword Transformer-1B.

Conclusion

We have proposed a new byte-level Transformer decoder architecture, SpaceByte. Our compute-
controlled experiments show that SpaceByte outperforms all other byte-level architectures and roughly
matches the performance of sub-word level Transformers.

Limitations SpaceByte uses a simple byte partitioning rule that relies on “spacelike” bytes, such
as spaces which typically denote word boundaries. As such, SpaceByte should not be expected
to perform well on arbitrary sequences of bytes, such as images or audio. Some languages, such
as Chinese, do not use spaces between words. SpaceByte is somewhat robust to these languages,
since e.g. Chinese characters are encoded using three bytes in UTF-8, which SpaceByte will
group together. However, our preliminary experiments suggest that SpaceByte performs worse than
subword transformers on Chinese text. It would therefore be desirable to improve upon and generalize
SpaceByte’s global block insertion rule.

The variable spacing between global blocks makes it more challenging to design and implement an
efficient batched inference sampling algorithm for SpaceByte.

Future Work SpaceByte uses multiscale modeling where the local model operates on bytes while the
global model typically operates on words. Another natural extension of our work is to try recursively
applying multiscale modeling at even longer scales, such as the sentence or paragraph level. It would
also be fruitful to investigate if Mamba blocks [25] could further improve SpaceByte’s performance.

Model Details

Hyperparameters for models shown in Table 1 and Table 2 are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4,
respectively. In Figure 4, we show another perspective of Figure 3 where we plot the bits-per-byte vs
the bytes trained divided by the number of model parameters.

For the subword models (but not the byte-level models), we tie the input embedding weights with
the output linear matrix weights [54]. In self-attention layers, we use a key dimension equal to 64.
Although we apply RoPE embeddings, we also included trained position embeddings.

SpaceByte For SpaceByte, we include trained position embeddings just before the first local
transformer block, and just before the first global transformer block.

Just like the other models, SpaceByte is trained using a fixed context size of T bytes. At the same
time, we also fix the maximum global context size of Tglobal patches. However, the number of patches
in a given context of T bytes is usually not exactly equal to Tglobal. To handle this mismatch during
training, if the number of patches from applying the patching rule (see e.g. Figure 2) to a context of T
bytes is greater Tglobal, then we simply ignore the bytes within these extra patches when calculating the
cross entropy. Alternatively, if the number of patches is less than Tglobal, then we pad the activations
for the global transformer blocks with zeroes and ignore the output of these global blocks. Thus,
the input activations to the global blocks is always a tensor of same shape for each iteration. This
discrepancy between the maximal global context size Tglobal and the actual number of patches results
in a small fracton of wasted compute during training, which we roughly minimize by roughly tuning
T/Tglobal. See Appendix C for pseudocode.

During inference, the model must stop predicting tokens before either the max number of bytes (T)
or the max number of patches (Tglobal) is reached.

A.1
FLOPs

The inference FLOPs-per-byte is the number of FLOPs required to output a byte of text during
inference. We calculate the FLOPs-per-byte as the FLOPs-per-token divided by the average number
of bytes per token (which is equal to 1 for byte-level models).

The FLOPs-per-token is the number of FLOPs required to output a token of text during inference (or
byte of text for byte-level models). The FLOPs-per-token for the various architectures is shown in
Table 6.

---Page Break---
Notation For all architectures, T is the context length; D is the model dimension (of the global model
for SpaceByte and MegaByte); eff = 4 is the model dimension expansion factor for feed-forward
layers; and V is the vocabulary size (which is 256 for byte-level models and 50257 for our subword
models). For the transformer architecture, L is the number of transformer blocks, and W is the
attention window size (which is equal to T if window attention is not used). For SpaceByte and
MegaByte, Dlocal is the dimension of the local model; Llocal is the number of local transformer blocks;
and Lglobal is the number of global transformer blocks. For SpaceByte, Tglobal is the maximum context
size for the global model, and Wlocal (which we set to Dlocal) is the attention window size for the local
blocks. For MegaByte, P is the patch size.

Training Details

B.1
Data

Each dataset prepared by downloaded it from Hugging Face8, concatenating sequences together, and
separating sequences with a special BOS token. When preparing a training sample with context size
T, we uniformly and randomly sample a sub-sequence of length T from the concatenated dataset. If
a BOS token is found in this subset, we align the context with the first BOS token found; i.e. we take
the context to be the first BOS token followed by the next T −1 tokens in the concatenated dataset. If
a BOS token is not found in the subset, we prepend a BOS token to the context. The context window
is always full and always begins with a BOS token.

For the SpaceByte models, we always insert global blocks after a BOS token. A valid UTF-8 encoding
never makes use of the byte values 254 or 255. We use 255 to encode the BOS token.

We train the SentencePiece tokenizers using the following command:
spm_train --input=train.txt --model_prefix=sp --model_type=bpe
--vocab_size=50257 --num_threads=32 --byte_fallback=True
--allow_whitespace_only_pieces=True --remove_extra_whitespaces=False
--normalization_rule_name=identity --input_sentence_size=10000000

B.2
Training

All models are trained using AdamW [55] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98, batch size 64, weight decay of
0.01, and gradient clipping [56] with a maximum norm of 1.0. Trainable parameters are randomly
initialized using a normal distribution with standard deviation σinit = 1 for all parameters except
for linear weight matrices, which are initialized with standard deviation of σinit = 1/√din, where
din is the input dimension for the linear layer. We scale the learning rate for each parameter by its
initialization standard deviation σinit.

With this setup, we found in our early hyperparameter search experiments that the optimal max
learning rate for all models is approximately γ = 0.005B−0.5 = 0.000625, where B = 64 is the
batch size. We therefore used γ = 0.000625 as the max learning rate for all models trained in
this work. We applied a linear learning rate warmup over the first 1% of training iterations. We
also multiply the learning rate by a “half-cosine” learning rate decay function cos(πx/2), where
0 ≤x ≤1 is the fraction of training iterations completed.9

Each model was trained using PyTorch on a single 40GB Nvidia A40 and A100 GPUs with mixed-
precision (bfloat16 and float32) training and FlashAttention [57, 58]. SpaceByte-793M+184M took
the longest to train, requiring about 10 days on an A100 GPU.10

8https://huggingface.co/datasets/pg19
https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucadiliello/STORIES
https://huggingface.co/datasets/monology/pile-uncopyrighted

9In our setup, we found cos(πx/2) to slightly outperform the more standard cosine decay from 1 to 0.1.
10We very roughly estimate that additional preliminary and failed experiments not shown in this work required
roughly as many FLOPs as the experiments shown in this work.

B.3
Hyperparameter Grid

We train models using a grid of different model dimensions and numbers of layers. In our early
small-scale experiments, we found that the hyperparameter grid described below effectively explores
the bits-per-byte and FLOPs-per-byte Pareto frontier for all models. To simplify the hyperparameter
grid, we restrict ourselves to model dimensions and layer numbers to half-powers of two, i.e. a power
of two times 1 or 3

2.

For models trained using 1018 FLOPs, we train model dimensions D ∈{384, 512, 768}. For models
trained using 1019 FLOPs, we train model dimensions D ∈{512, 768, 1024}.

For SpaceByte and MegaByte, D is the global model dimension. The local model dimension is
chosen from Dlocal ∈{ 1

2D, 3

4D} if D is a power of two, or Dlocal ∈{ 1

2D, 2

3D} if D is a power of
two times 3

2. However, in order to avoid excessively low FLOP utilization, we restrict Dlocal ≥256
(or Dlocal ≥384) for models trained using 1018 FLOPs (or 1019 FLOPs).

To set the number of layers, we roughly follow Levine et al. [59], who found that the compute-optimal
number of layers for a Transformer roughly follows L ∼12.5 log2(D/154). We round this number
to the nearest half-power of two to obtain LD, for which L384 = 16, L512 = 24, L768 = 32, and
L1024 = 32. For Transformer models, we choose the number of layers from L ∈{ 1

2LD, LD}.

For SpaceByte and MegaByte models, we choose the number of local and global layers from
Llocal = Lglobal ∈{ 3

8LD, 1

2LD} if LD is a power of two, or Llocal = Lglobal ∈{ 1

3LD, 1

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our claims are summarized in the abstract, and restated in the introduction.
Our abstract makes three claims, which we enumerate in the following quote:

“SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger
transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers.
(1) We find that
performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after
certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries.
(2) Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget,
SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and (3) roughly matches the
performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.”
These claims are substantiated in Sections 5 and 6. The first claim is supported by Figure 3
and Table 1, which compare SpaceByte to “SpaceByte (fixed P),” which is a variant of
SpaceByte that uses fixed patch sizes instead of applying the larger blocks only after certain
bytes. The final two claims are also supported by Figure 3 and Table 1, along with Table 2.
At the end of our introduction, we note that our results could be limited to the text modalities
(English text, LaTex formatted arXiv papers, and source code) that we study.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: At the end of our introduction, we note that our results could be limited to the
text modalities (English text, LaTex formatted arXiv papers, and source code) that we study.
We emphasize in Section 2 and our conclusion that generalizing SpaceByte’s performance to
other text modalities (by improving the global block insertion rule) is an important direction
for future work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be

20


---Page Break---
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used
by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers
discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use
their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play
an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.
Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No theoretical results were presented.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the
main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or
conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Open source code, job execution scripts, and a jupyter notebook for fully
reproducing our results are available at github.com/kjslag/spacebyte.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all
submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example

21


---Page Break---
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient
instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in
supplemental material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Open access to code and thorough instructions for reproducing our experiments
are available at github.com/kjslag/spacebyte. This includes code for the models, training,
and bits-per-byte evaluation, and a requirements.txt for pip.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run
to reproduce the results.
See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines
(https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits,
hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand
the results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The experimental setting is described in Section 4. The models studied are
summarized in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 6. Additional model details are provided in Appendix A.
Training details are provided in Appendix B. Any additional details are available in our
released source code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

22


---Page Break---
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Tables 1 and 2 give upper bounds for the 1-sigma statistical error and clarify
that these statistical errors account for the finite number of evaluation samples. We also
estimate the statistical uncertainty due to the different test splits used by other works in
Section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars,
confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that
support the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the
computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to
reproduce the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Compute resource requirements are detailed at the end of Appendix B.2, along
with an additional compute estimate for preliminary and failed experiments (in a footnote).
Models trained in our main experiments used 1018 or 1019 FLOPs for training, as specified
in Section 4. When comparing to other works, training each model required 6.5 × 1019
FLOPs, as specified in Section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]

23


---Page Break---
Justification: Regarding the data-related concerns, we omit comparisons to the Books3
dataset since this dataset is no longer publically available and because it is unclear to us if
Books3 is legal under fair use, as stated in Footnote 7.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special
consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We briefly mention in the abstract and introduction that tokenization can
increase the vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Lessening this adversarial vulnerability was
one of our motivations. We are not aware of any potential negative societal impacts of our
work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not release any data or models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

24


---Page Break---
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include citations to all datasets that we use. We believe that we have
properly respected the licenses and terms of use for all code and datasets that we used.
Notably, we avoided the Books3 dataset for this reason, since Books3 may not be respecting
the licenses of the works from which it derives. Code attributions and licenses are provided
in the ‘license’ directory of our released source code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible
should be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: Human subjects were not involved in this research.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
