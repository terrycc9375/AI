Abstract

In this paper, we propose a new framework for zero-shot object navigation. Existing
zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed
objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better
preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of
LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene
graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-
friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to
help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the
nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further
design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework
with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on
MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while
the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is
the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised
object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark. Project page.

Introduction

Object navigation, which requires an agent to navigate to an object specified by its category in
unknown environment [3], is a fundamental problem in a wide range of robotic tasks. Thanks to the
advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL), modular-based object navigation
approaches [6; 32; 48] have achieved impressive performance in recent years, which caches the visual
perception results of the RGB-D observation into semantic map and learns a policy to predict actions
according to this map. However, conventional methods rely on time-consuming training in simulation
environment, which only works well on specific datasets and can only handle limited categories of
goal object.

In order to solve above limitations and enhance the generalization ability of object navigation, zero-
shot object navigation has received increasing attention. In the zero-shot setting, the system does
not require any training or finetuning before applied to real-world scenarios, and the goal category
can be freely specified by text in an open-vocabulary manner. Since training data is unavailable,
recent zero-shot object navigation methods [46; 52] leverage large language models (LLM) [36; 1]
instead of RL agent to perform decision-making processes, where the extensive knowledge in LLM
helps to address various common-sense reasoning problems in zero-shot. In these works, the LLM is
required to select a frontier for the agent to explore the unobserved area. As LLM cannot perceive the

Figure 1: Different from previous zero-shot object navigation methods [46; 52] that directly prompt
LLM with text of nearby object categories, we construct a hierarchical 3D scene graph to represent
the observed environment and prompts LLM to fully exploit the structure information in the graph.
Our SG-Nav preserves fine-grained scene context and makes reasonable and explainable decisions.

environment visually, they select the categories of objects near each frontier to prompt LLM and rate
the possibility of each frontier. While these approaches achieve zero-shot object navigation, there
are still some drawbacks in their design: (1) they prompt LLM with only the text of nearby object
categories, which is less informative and lacks scene context such as spatial relationship; (2) they
let LLM directly output the possibility for each frontier, which is an abstract task and does not fully
utilizes the reasoning ability of the LLM. As a result, their reasoning process is not explainable and
the performance is far from satisfactory.

In this paper, we propose a new object navigation framework namely SG-Nav, which fully exploits
the reasoning ability of LLM for zero-shot navigation planning with high accuracy and fast speed. As
shown in Figure 1, different from previous LLM-based object navigation framework that prompts
LLM with only text of object categories and directly outputs probability, SG-Nav represents the
complicated 3D environment in an online updated hierarchical 3D scene graph and utilizes it to
hierarchically prompt LLM for reliable and explainable decision making. Benefit from the scene
graph representation, we further design a graph-based re-perception mechanism to empower the
object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. Specifically, we first
construct an online 3D hierarchical scene graph along with the exploration of the agent. Since there
are many levels and nodes in the scene graph, it is challenging to build the scene graph in real
time. To solve this problem, we propose to densely connect the newly detected nodes to previous
nodes in an incremental manner. We design a new form of prompt to control the computational
complexity of this dense connecting process linear to the number of new nodes, which is followed by
a pruning process to discard less informative edges. With the 3D scene graph, we divide it into several
subgraphs and propose a hierarchical chain-of-thought to let LLM perceive the structural information
in each subgraph for explainable probability prediction. Then we interpolate the probability of each
subgraph to the frontiers for decision making, which can be further explained by summarizing the
reasoning process for the most related subgraphs. Moreover, we also notice that previous object
navigation framework fails when detecting out a false positive goal object. So we propose a graph-
based re-perception mechanism to judge the credibility of the observed goal object by accumulating
relevant probability of subgraphs. The agent will give up goal object with low credibility for robust
navigation. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments.
Our SG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on all benchmarks, surpassing previous
top-performance zero-shot method by more than 10% in terms of SR. SG-Nav can also explain the
reason for its decision at each step, making it more practical in human-agent interaction scenarios.

Figure 2: Pipeline of SG-Nav. We construct a hierarchical 3D scene graph as well as an occupancy
map online. At each step, we divide the scene graph into several subgraphs, each of which is prompted
to LLM with a hierarchical chain-of-thought for structural understanding of the scene context. We
interpolate the probability score of each subgraph to the frontiers and select the frontier with highest
score for exploration. This decision is also explainable by summarizing the reasoning process of
the LLM. With the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism, which
helps the agent give up false positive goal object by continuous credibility judgement.

52]. DD-PPO [38] implicitly encodes the visual observation into latent code and predicts low-level
actions. Follow-up works increase the performance by better visual representation [29; 43], auxiliary
tasks [44] and data augmentation [26]. However, since this kind of methods implicitly encode 3D
scene and directly predict actions, which may fail to capture fine-grained context. The end-to-end
RL also suffers from low sampling efficiency. To solve these problems, modular-based methods
map the visual perception results to BEV or 3D map [49; 42; 41] and update it online. The agent
learns where to navigate with this semantic map [6; 32; 48]. In persuit of open-vocabulary object
navigation, COWs [11] and ZSON [25] align the goal to CLIP embedding [30]. L3MVN [46] and
ESC [52] further utilize large language models for zero-shot decision making. Our SG-Nav is also a
LLM-based zero-shot framework. But differently, we propose to construct 3D scene graph instead
of semantic map to prompt LLM with hierarchical chain-of-thought and graph-based re-perception,
which better preserves the scene context and makes the decision more robust.

Large Pretrained Models for Robotics: Large pretrained language models [1; 36] and vision-
language models [30; 20; 23; 20; 21] have received increasing attention in recent years, which is
widely applied in embodied AI tasks including navigation [17; 11; 25; 46; 52; 35; 13; 51], task
planning [2; 7; 16; 27; 4; 39; 33; 40], manipulation [22; 14; 15; 47]. It is observed that large
vision-language models becomes a good hand in dealing with embodied AI problems due to its
end-to-end processing of images and language. NLMap [7] leverages CLIP embedding [30] to build
an open-vocabulary map for task planning. Voxposer [15] automatically generates code to interacts
with VLMs [28; 18], which produces a sequence of 3D affordance maps and constraint maps to guide
the optimization of path planning. However, it is still hard to process streaming RGB-D video for
vision-language models. To better make use of the observed 3D scenes, recent methods [52; 51]
of navigation describe the scene in pure text and utilize it to prompt LLM. Our SG-Nav, instead,
represents the 3D scene using scene graph, which preserves much more context information. The
proposed hierarchical chain-of-thought and graph-based re-perception methods can also better exploit
the potential of LLM for object navigation.

Approach

In this section, we first provide the definition of zero-shot object navigation and introduce the overall
pipeline of SG-Nav. Then we describe how to construct an open-vocabulary and hierarchical 3D scene
graph online. Finally we show how to prompt the LLM with 3D scene graph to achieve context-aware
and robust object navigation.

Zero-shot Object Navigation

Problem Definition. A mobile agent is tasked with navigating to an object o specified by its category
c in an unknown environment. The agent receives streaming RGB-D video as input along with its
exploration and decides where to go until it finds the goal object. Formally, at each time instant t,
the input to the agent is a posed RGB-D image and o and the agent should execute an action a ∼A,
where A consists of move_forward, turn_left, turn_right and stop. The task is successful
if the agent stops within ds meters of the goal object in less than T steps. Otherwise it fails.

Different from conventional object navigation which requires training in simulation environment with
fixed vocabulary of categories c, we study zero-shot object navigation: the goal category c can be
freely specified with text in an open-vocabulary manner, and the navigation system does not require
any training or finetuning, which is of great generalization ability.

Overview. Since performing open-vocabulary object navigation without training is very challenging,
we resort to large language model (LLM) [36; 1] to solve this problem. LLM demonstrates extensive
knowledge and surprising generalization ability, which is a best choice to handle this zero-shot
task. To make LLM aware of the visual observation of the environment, we propose to construct
an online 3D scene graph, which contains rich context information about the environment and is
suitable for interacting with LLM. At each step, we prompt the LLM with our 3D scene graph with
hierarchical chain-of-thought and graph-based re-perception for decision making. The pipeline is
shown in Figure 2.

Online 3D Scene Graph Construction

In this subsection, we first provide formal definition of our 3D scene graph. Then we detail how to
construct the scene graph in real time and online.

Figure 3: The incremental generation of edges.
We densely connect newly registered nodes (pur-
ple) to all other nodes by efficiently prompting the
LLM. We divide the edges into long edges and
short edges and prune less informative ones with
different strategies.

Hierarchical 3D Scene Graph. A 3D scene
graph describe the 3D scene with nodes and
edges between these nodes. We define three
kinds of nodes: object, group and room, to rep-
resent the scenes in different graininess. Here
group indicates a set of related objects, such as
a dining table and its surrounding chairs, TV
and TV cabinet. Edge can exist between any
pair of nodes. If two nodes are not in the same
level (e,g, chair and living room), the edge be-
tween them represents affiliation (i.e. this chair
belongs to this living room). If two nodes are
in the same level, the edge represents the re-
lationship between them, which can be spatial
relationship such as on the top of between close
objects, or functional relationship between far
away objects like a TV and its opposite sofa.

Incremental Updating and Pruning. Since
there are many objects in the environment and
the relationship between them are complicated,
building the scene graph for the whole scene
is time-consuming. To enable real-time online
construction of the 3D scene graph, we propose
to incrementally update it across frames. That is,
at each time t, we register new nodes Nt from
the RGB-D observation, and connect these nodes with the previous scene graph Gt−1 to acquire Gt.

We adopt different strategy to acquire different level of nodes. For object nodes, we leverage online
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method [12] to acquire the 3D instance. Formally, at each
time t, the method detects and segments objects from the RGB-D observation and synchronously
reconstruct the 3D point clouds for the environment. These newly detected objects will be matched
with object nodes detected from the previous t −1 frames and merged into them. Objects that do not
match with any previous one will be registered as a new object node. Each object node has a semantic

category and its confidence score. Then group nodes are computed based on all object nodes up to
time t. If two object nodes are connected by an edge and their categories are related, we register a
group for them. This process will iterate until no new node can be assign to this group. We pre-define
a dictionary to tell which pair of categories are related by LLM, which is detailed in Section 6.2. For
room nodes, we follow the same paradigm for acquiring object nodes, where room is regarded as
instance and thus we can prompt the open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation model with the room
type.

We also design different strategies to build edges between the nodes of different levels. We first
connect high-level nodes with their affiliated low-level nodes. For room-object node pair, we think
the object belongs to the room if the instance mask of this object on the point clouds is contained
in the instance mask of this room. For room-group node pair, we connect them if all objects in this
group belongs to the room. We do not additionally connect group and object nodes since the former
is registered based on the latter.

Then we connect related object nodes to build intra-level edges, as shown in Figure 3. Note there
is no intra-level edges between group and room nodes. For newly registered object nodes at time
t, we first densely connect them with all object nodes, and then perform pruning to remove less
informative edges. We combine m newly registered nodes and n previous nodes to form m(m + n)
edges. For each edge, we can prompt LLM with the categories of connected nodes and ask LLM to
infer their relationship. However, traversing all m(m + n) edges and feed prompts to LLM requires
O(m(m + n)) computational complexity. To speed up the dense connecting process for real-time
processing, we propose a new format of prompt: Predict the most likely relationships between these
pairs of objects: [{(a, b)|a ∈Sn, b ∈Sn ∪Sp}], where Sn and Sp are the set of m newly registered
nodes and n previous nodes. This enables LLM to generate relationships between all pairs of nodes
in one-shot with much less computational cost, for which we provide theoretical derivation below.

According to [37], complexity of processing L tokens for LLM is O(Lr), where 1 < r ≤2. Suppose
Lpro and Lres represent the number of tokens of the prompt and LLM’s response respectively.
Then the computational complexity of processing m(m + n) pairs of nodes for our method and
the naive O(m(m + n)) method are Tour = O ((Lpro + m(m + n) · Lres + m(m + n) · 2)r) and
Tnaive = m(m + n) · O ((Lpro + Lres)r) respectively2. Since Lpro ≫2 and Lpro ≫Lres, we can
approximately treat
2
Lpro = 0 and Lres

Lpro = α (α ≤0.01). Assume that 1 ≤m ≤5, 1 ≤n ≤100.
We then compute the ratio between them:

Tour
Tnaive
= (Lpro + m(m + n) · Lres + m(m + n) · 2)r

m(m + n) · (Lpro + Lres)r
<
c
m + n
(1)

where c is a small constant. Consequently, our method reduces the complexity from O(m(m + n))
to O(m). In this way, the LLM can generate new edge proposals in fast speed.

We further prune the dense connected edges to make the 3D scene graph more precise. We divide
newly generated relationships into two categories: long-range and short-range. The basis for this
division is whether there is a RGB-D image containing the two connected objects. If true, this
edge is short-range, for which we can feed the RGB image to a vision language model (VLM) like
LLaVA [23] and ask whether this relationship exists. Nonexistent ones will be pruned. Otherwise the
edge is a long-range one. We design two standards to validate it: (1) the line connecting two objects
is unobstructed and parallel to the wall of room; (2) these two object nodes belong to the same room
node. Only edges meet with both standards can be preserved.

3.3
Prompting LLM with 3D Scene Graph

In this subsection, we describe how to prompt LLM with the 3D scene graph at each step for decision
making. Since directly predicting a is hard for LLM, we adopt Frontier-based Exploration (FBE)
strategy to divide the decision into two part: (1) synchronous with the 3D scene graph, we build an
online occupancy map to indicate explored, unexplored and occupied area in BEV, based on which
we compute the frontiers of explored area. In order to further explore the environment, the agent
must go through one of the frontier. So in high level, the LLM is only required to select one of the
frontier which has the highest probability to find o; (2) once the frontier to be explore is chosen, we
simply apply local policy like Fast Marching Method [34] for path planning and output a.

2We provide detailed proof process and illustrated examples in Section 6.3.

Hierarchical Chain-of-thought Prompting. Different from previous methods [46; 52] that prompt
LLM with only categories of objects near each frontier, we compute the probability P fro of each
frontier by prompting LLM with our 3D scene graph. At time t, we divide the scene graph Gt into
subgraphs, each of which is determined by an object node with all its parent nodes and other directly
connected object nodes. For each subgraph, we predict P sub, the possibility of goal appearing near
this subgraph. Then the probability P fro
i
of the i-th frontier can be averaged by:

P fro
i
=

M
X

j=1

P sub
j
Dij
(i ∈{1, 2, ..., N})
(2)

where M is the total number of subgraphs and Dij is the distance between the center of the i-th
frontier and the central object node of the j-th subgraph.

In order to make the prediction of P sub accurate and explainable, we propose a hierarchical chain-
of-thought method to prompt LLM, which fully exploits the structure information contained in the
subgraphs. Specifically, for each subgraph, LLM is first prompted with Predict the most likely
distance between [object] and [goal], where [object] means the category of the central object node.
Then we prompt LLM to ask question related to the navigation goal, with the prompt: Ask questions
about the [object] and [goal] for predicting their distance. After obtaining the questions about
goal, we prompt LLM to answer those questions according to the information of subgraph, with the
prompt: Given [nodes] and [edges] of subgraph, answer above [questions]. Therefore, from those
answers we get all the necessary information required for inferring the position of goal. Finally, we
prompt LLM to summarize the conversation and predict P, with the prompt Based on the above
conversation, determine the most likely distance between this subgraph and [goal]. And P sub can
be simply computed by taking the inverse of the outputted distance. The LLM also summarizes the
analysis process of the nearest 3 subgraphs to the selected frontier to explain the reason for decision.

Graph-based Re-perception. Conventional object navigation framework does not take perception
error into consideration. Once the agent detects out false positive objects of the goal category, it will
not explore or perceive the environment any more and directly navigate to this object.

To solve this problem, we enhance the current object navigation framework with graph-based re-
perception mechanism. When the agent detects out a goal object, it will approach to this object,
observe it from multiple perspectives and accumulate a credibility score S. For the k-th RGB-D
observation since this moment, we compute the credibility of it by:

Sk = Ck ·

M
X

j=1

P sub
j
Dj
(3)

where Ck is the confidence score of this goal object, Dj is the distance between the central object
node of the j-th subgraph and this object. The success condition for our re-perception mechanism is:

Nstop < Nmax, where Nstop = N, s.t.

N−1
X

i=1
Si < Sthres ≤

N
X

i=1
Si
(4)

where Nmax is a pre-defined maximum number of steps. If succeed, the agent will navigate to this
goal object without any further exploration or perception. Otherwise, it will give up this object and
continue the exploration.

Evaluation Metrics: We report three metrics including success rate (SR), success rate weighted by
path length (SPL) and SoftSPL. SR is the core metric of object-goal navigation task, representing the
success rate of successful navigation episode. SPL measures the ability of agent to find the optimal
path. If success, SPL = optimal path length

path length
, otherwise SPL = 0. SoftSPL [8] measures the navigation
progress and navigation efficiency of the agent. Higher is better for all the three metrics.

Implementation Details: We set 500 as the maximal navigation steps. The farthest and closest
perceived distances of the agent are 10m and 1.5m. Each step of the agent takes 0.25m, and each
rotation takes 30◦. The camera of agent is 0.90m above the ground, and perspective is horizontal.
The camera outputs 640 × 480 RGB-D images. We maintain a 800 × 800 2D occupancy map with
the resolution of 0.05m, which can represent a 40m × 40m large-scale scene. In equation 4, the
hypre-parameters Nmax is 10 and Sthres is 0.8. For the verification of short edge, we adopt LLaVA-
1.6 (Mistral-7B) [24] as the VLM for discrimination. We choose LLaMA-7B [36] and GPT-4-0613
as the LLM for our SG-Nav, which are discriminated by SG-Nav-LLaMA and SG-Nav-GPT.

methods by about 10% on all three benchmarks. We also notice that on the challenging MP3D
dataset, SG-Nav even outperforms supervised methods including SemEXP and PONI. Note that the
improvement of SR is larger than SPL, this is because our graph-based re-perception mechanism can
help the agent give up false positive goal object, which can significantly increase the success rate.
However, during the process the re-perception, the agent still needs to approach to the goal to observe
it from multi views. So this strategy cannot reduce the length of path.

We also compare per-category success rate of different zero-shot methods in Figure 4. For all goal
categories, SG-Nav outperforms other methods by a large margin, especially on categories that have
more relationships with other objects such as fireplace and towel.

Scene Graph and Re-perception. In Table 2, we
compare the design choices of scene graph (SG) and
re-perception (RP). Without RP, SG-Nav will move to
the goal once the detector finds a goal, even thought
the goal is a false positive. Due to the complexity of
the scene, it is common for detector to make mistakes,
which leads to irreversible navigation. If we further
remove the whole SG, our framework degenerates
to a random exploration model. The agent randomly
selects frontier, resulting in a significant performance degradation on all datasets.

Room Node and Group Node. As shown in Table 3, we compare the performance between different
architectures of scene graph by ablating the design of group and room nodes. We remove the room
or group node with the edges connected to it and obtain 4 different scene graph architecture. The
removal of room node and group node results in 0.7% and 1.1% SR degradation on MP3D dataset
respectively. We observe the group node is more important than room node, which is because the
group nodes aggregate objects into a whole and thus reduce the redundant information and the
complexity of scene graph.

Efficiency of Scene Graph Construction. In Figure 5, we show the speed of generating densely
connected new edges for our proposed efficient prompt-based method and the naive O(m(m + n))
method. The naive method requires time consumption that is linear to the number of edges, while our
efficient prompt significantly reduces the computational complexity.

Effects of edges. In Table 4, we study the importance of different kinds of edges. The results validate
that edges play an important role in our framework, which helps the hierarchical chain-of-thought
better exploit the structural information contained in the environment.

Effects of CoT. In Table 5, we demonstrate the importance of CoT prompting. "Text prompting"
refers to directly converting the 3D scene graph into text and prompting the LLM. "Text prompt
separately" means converting the nodes and edges into text individually. Additionally, we removed
the edges between layers to further validate the necessity of hierarchical graph structure. The
experimental results show that our CoT prompting can effectively exploit the structure information
contained in the 3D scene graph.

4.4
Qualitative Analysis

We visualize the navigation process of SG-Nav in Figure 6. The upper example shows that SG-Nav is
able to explain the reason for its decision based on the nearest 3 subgraphs to the selected frontier.
The lower example demonstrates that SG-Nav can accumulate credibility of the detected goal object
and utilize it to judge the authenticity of this goal, which effectively corrects perception error.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed SG-Nav, a zero-shot object-goal navigation framework that prompts
LLM with scene graph to inference the position of goal object. We first construct a hierarchical
3D scene graph online to preserve rich context information of the environment. To speed up the
building of scene graph, we propose an incremental updating and pruning strategy, which first densely
connects newly registered nodes to all nodes by efficiently prompting the LLM. Then we divide
the edges into long-range and short-range to prune them with different strategies. At each step,
we divide the scene graph into subgraphs and prompt LLM with hierarchical chain-of-thought to

output the probability score of each subgraph. Then the score for each frontier can be acquired by
simple interpolation, which is also explainable as we can summarize the decision process of LLM
on each subgraph. With the graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to
empower SG-Nav with the ability to give up false positive goal objects and thus correct perception
error. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate the great performance of SG-Nav and the
effectiveness of our design.

Potential Limitations. Despite of the great performance, SG-Nav still has several limitations: (1)
SG-Nav relies on online 3D instance segmentation method for scene graph construction. Currently
we adopt 2D vision-language model and vision foundation model to segment each frame and merge
the masks across different frames, which is not end-to-end and 3D-aware. A stronger online 3D
instance segmentation model will further boost the performance of SG-Nav. (2) SG-Nav can only
handle object-goal navigation yet. However, due to the strong zero-shot generalization ability of
LLM and the rich context contained in 3D scene graph, we believe SG-Nav can be further extended
to more tasks such as image-goal navigation and vision-and-language navigation.

Appendix

6.1
Overview

In this appendix, we first provide the dictionary for grouping object nodes in Section 6.2. Then we
provide the proof process and illustrated example on computational complexity of our efficient edge
generation method in Section 6.3. Next we provide the complete prompts used in our approach in
Section 6.4. Finally we provide more visualization results in Section 6.5.

6.2
Related Categories

When registering a new group node, we need to judge whether two object categories are related. We
use LLM to generate the relationship dictionary, as shown below:

(Bed, Nightstand) (Wardrobe, Dresser) (Bookshelf, Chair) (Counter, Stove) (Table, Chair) (Bathroom
Sink, Mirror) (Shower, Bathtub) (Refrigerator, Freezer) (Oven, Microwave) (Washing Machine, Dryer)
(Sofa, Table) (Desk, Office Chair) (Computer, Monitor) (Piano, Bench) (Fireplace, Mantel) (Table,
Mirror) (Window, Curtains) (Closet, Hangers) (Bathroom Cabinet, Toiletries) (Living Room Rug,
Coffee Table) (Kitchen Cabinet, Dishes) (Dining Room Chandelier, Dining Table) (Clock, Wall)
(Floor Lamp, Reading Chair) (Couch, Throw Pillows) (Bookcase, Books)

6.3
Time Complexity for Edge Updating

Here we provide detailed proof for Eq (1).
As shown in Figure 7, the computational com-
plexity of processing m(m + n) pairs of nodes for the naive method is O(m(m + n)) and
the time is Tnaive = m(m + n) · O ((Lpro + Lres)r). Complexity of our method is Tour =
O ((Lpro + m(m + n) · Lres + m(m + n) · 2)r), where Lpro ≫2 and Lpro ≫Lres.

So we can approximate that
2
Lpro = 0 and Lres

Lpro = α (α ≤0.01). According to the actual scene
graph, usually 1 ≤m ≤5, 1 ≤n ≤100. Then we compute the ratio as:

Tour
Tnaive
= (Lpro + m(m + n) · Lres + m(m + n) · 2)r

m(m + n) · (Lpro + Lres)r
=


1 + m(m+n)·Lres

Lpro

m(m + n) ·

1 + Lres

Since
2
Lpro = 0, we have:

Tour

Since α meets 0 < α ≪1, we can use the small value approximation principle ( 1+pα

where c = 5.49. Our method reduces the complexity by (m + n) times, from O(m(m + n)) to
O(m). So LLM generates relationship with O(m) complexity, which is much faster than the naive
baseline.

Prompt

We provide the complete prompts of SG-Nav.

Edge Connecting. In the edge connecting process, the complete prompt is as follows:

You are an AI assistant with commonsense and strong ability to infer the
spatial relationships in an indoor scene.

You need to provide the possible spatial relationships between several
pairs of objects.
Relationships include ["next to", "above", "opposite
to", "below", "inside", "behind", "in front of", ...].

All the pairs of objects are provided in JSON format, and you should
also response in JSON format.
Here are 2 examples:

1.

Input:

[{"object1":
"chair", "object2":
"table"}, {"object1":
"monitor",
"object2":
"desk"}]

Response:

[{"relationships":
"next to"}, {"relationships":
"above"}]

2.

Input:

[{"object1":
"sofa", "object2":
"TV"}, {"object1":
"plant", "object2":
"chair"}]

Response:

[{"relationships":
"opposite to"}, {"relationships":
"behind"}]

Now you predict these pairs of objects:
[{"object1":
{}, "object2":
{}}, {"object1":
{}, "object2":
{}}, ...]

where {} will be replace by the object categories.

Hierarchical CoT. In the process of goal inference, we use the following prompts to let LLM predict
the most likely position of goal.

Step 1 (Predict Distance of Object):

You are an AI assistant with commonsense and strong ability to infer the
distance between two objects in an indoor scene.

You need to predict the most likely distance of two objects in a room.
You need to answer the distance in meters and give your reason.
Here is
the JSON format:

Input:

{"object1":
"table", "object2":
"chair"}

Response:

{"distance":
0.5, "reason":
"Because there is always a chair next to
the table."}

Now predict the distance and give your reason:
{"object1":
{},
"object2":
{}}

where {} will be replace by the object.

Step 2 (Ask Question):

You are an AI assistant with commonsense and strong ability to infer the
spatial relationships in an indoor scene.

But you have insufficient information.
You need to ask a question
about the spatial relationship between the object and the goal in the
following JSON format:

Input:

{"object":
"sofa", "goal":
"TV"}

Response:

{"question":
"Is there a table next to the sofa?"}

Now ask question:
{"object":
{}, "goal":
{}}

where {} will be replace by the object and goal.

Step 3 (Answer Question):

You are an AI assistant with commonsense and strong ability to answer
question about the objects in an indoor scene.

Given a graph scene of the scene, you need to answer the question in the
following JSON format:

Input:

{"subgraph":
{"nodes":
["sofa", "table", ...], "edges":
["sofa next to
table", ...]}, "question":
"Is there a table next to the sofa?"}

Response:

{"answer":
"Yes"}

Now answer question:
{"subgraph":
{}, "question":
{}}

where {} will be replace by the subgraph and question.

Step 4 (Predict Distance of Subgraph):

15


---Page Break---
You are an AI assistant with commonsense and strong ability to infer the
distance between a subgraph and a goal in an indoor scene.

You need to predict the most likely distance of a subgraph and a goal in
a room.
You need to answer the distance in meters and give your reason.
Here is the JSON format:

Input:

{"subgraph":
{"nodes":
["sofa", "table", ...], "edges":
["sofa next to
table", ...]}, "goal":
"TV"}

Response:

{"distance":
2, "reason":
"Because TV and sofa are on both sides of
table."}

Now predict the distance and give your reason:
{"subgraph":
{}, "goal":
{}}

where {} will be replace by the subgraph and goal.

predicts a wrong location of chair because there are sofa and TV near this frontier, where there is
high probability of chair to appear here. This makes the agent harder to find the goal in limited steps.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the limitations in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

17


---Page Break---
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the full set of assumptions as well as a complete proof in Sec-
tion 6.3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The results in our paper can be reproduced by the readers.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often

18


---Page Break---
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have uploaded our code on MP3D dataset in the supplementary materials.
We will release all code upon acceptance. It takes some time for us to clean the whole
project and make the code easy to play with.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have specify the experimental settings in Section 4.1.

19


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The evaluation of our model is performed on four RTX 3090 GPUs.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our method is currently only used for academic research.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited all the code and dataset that we use.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

---Page Break---
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
