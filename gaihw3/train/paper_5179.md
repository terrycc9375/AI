Abstract

To ensure large language models (LLMs) are used safely, one must reduce their
propensity to hallucinate or to generate unacceptable answers. A simple and of-
ten used strategy is to first let the LLM generate multiple hypotheses and then
employ a reranker to choose the best one. In this paper, we draw a parallel be-
tween this strategy and the use of redundancy to decrease the error rate in noisy
communication channels. We conceptualize the generator as a sender transmitting
multiple descriptions of a message through parallel noisy channels. The receiver
decodes the message by ranking the (potentially corrupted) descriptions and se-
lecting the one found to be most reliable. We provide conditions under which
this protocol is asymptotically error-free (i.e., yields an acceptable answer almost
surely) even in scenarios where the reranker is imperfect (governed by Mallows or
Zipf-Mandelbrot models) and the channel distributions are statistically dependent.
We use our framework to obtain reranking laws which we validate empirically on
two real-world tasks using LLMs: text-to-code generation with DeepSeek-Coder
7B and machine translation of medical data with TowerInstruct 13B.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across many tasks in natural
language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. Despite their capabilities, instances
of hallucinations and other critical errors occasionally arise, casting doubt on the reliability of their
predictions, without clear indication of when and how badly they might fail (Ji et al., 2023; Guerreiro
et al., 2023). This is particularly concerning as these models are increasingly used in high-stakes
applications such as those within the medical or legal domains (Hung et al., 2023) or as agents that
can perform multiple tasks, including generating and executing code (Wang et al., 2024).

The most common mitigation strategy is to “steer” the LLM with the aid of a reward model or
directly from human preferences, either at training time (Stiennon et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2024;
Rafailov et al., 2024) or during decoding (Liu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). A simple and effective
decoding-time strategy is first to generate multiple hypotheses and then use a reranker to select the
most appropriate one. Several generation techniques used with modern LLMs, including voting
procedures (Borgeaud and Emerson, 2020; Wang et al., 2023; Liévin et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2022),
minimum Bayes risk decoders (Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Freitag et al., 2022), quality-aware decoders
(Fernandes et al., 2022), or other types of hypothesis ensembling/reranking techniques (Farinhas
et al., 2023; Ni et al., 2023; Bertsch et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024), embody this idea. An essential
aspect of these procedures is that they all add redundancy as an intermediate step (by generating
multiple hypotheses) to increase the chances of returning an acceptable answer as the final output.

The idea of adding redundancy to decrease the error rate in noisy channels is a cornerstone of
communication theory, more specifically in forward error correction methods. In its simplest

form—repetition codes—a message block is sent multiple times, and the decoder uses some form of
majority voting to recover the original message with high probability (MacKay, 2002; Cover and
Thomas, 2006). The same idea underlies more sophisticated error-correcting codes (Hamming, 1950;
Reed and Solomon, 1960; Gallager, 1962; Berrou et al., 1993).

In this paper, we draw a parallel between these two worlds by regarding generator-reranker LLMs as
communication systems (§2 and Fig. 1, left). We conceptualize the LLM generator G as a sender
transmitting N message descriptions in parallel through noisy channels, leading to N potentially
corrupted hypotheses. Then, the receiver, which corresponds to the reranker R, decodes the message
by ranking the potentially corrupted descriptions and selecting the one found to be most reliable. The
goal is for the combined (G, R) system to have lower error rate than G alone, and for the error rate to
decay quickly with N. Our main contributions are as follows:

• We show that when the channel distributions are independent, this simple protocol is asymptotically
error-free (i.e., it generates an acceptable answer almost surely when N →∞), even in scenarios
where the reranker is imperfect, e.g., governed by a Mallows or a Zipf-Mandelbrot model. In the
former case, the error probability decays exponentially fast (§3).
• We show that the protocol is still asymptotically error-free if we assume that the channel distribu-
tions are statistically dependent. When they are coupled by a Beta prior, we show that the error
probability decays as a power law when the reranker is perfect (§4).
• We use our framework to obtain “reranking laws”, which we validate empirically on text-to-code
generation with DeepSeek-Coder 7B (§5.1), on machine translation of medical data with TowerIn-
struct 13B (§5.2), and on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks (App. B.3).

Notation.
We denote [N] := {1, ..., N} and we use the shorthand notation X1:N := (X1, ..., XN).
We use capital letters (X, Y, ...) for random variables and represent probability distributions by
P(X), P(Y ), etc. We denote expectations of functions f under P(X) by EX[f(X)].

A Communication-Theoretic Perspective of Generator-Reranker Systems

The focus of our paper is on generator-reranker systems: a generator G (such as an LLM) is
prompted with a query q (e.g., a question to be answered, a source text to be translated, or a textual
prompt for code). As a response to this query, G generates N candidate answers y1, ..., yN (called
hypotheses). We are agnostic about the internals of G and the way the hypotheses are generated:
they could come from the same system through sampling or beam search, or they could come from an
ensemble of different systems. These hypotheses are then processed by a reranker R, which ranks
them and returns as the final output the one which is found to be the best answer. We are also agnostic
about how R is built—it could be an external system or it could be part of (or share parameters with)
the generator. Commonly used rerankers are quality estimators (Fernandes et al., 2022), energy-based
models (Bhattacharyya et al., 2021), reward models (Li et al., 2022), and minimum Bayes risk
decoders (Kumar and Byrne, 2002; Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Freitag et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022).

Regardless of specific design decisions, the goal of the generator-reranking system (G, R) is to
leverage the reranker R to produce better answers (according to some quality metric) than the ones
which would be obtained through G alone (e.g., a single sample). In this paper, we show that the
propensity for this combined system to generate unacceptable outputs, such as those containing
critical errors or hallucinations, decays quickly enough with N under mild assumptions on G and R.

We draw an analogy with communication theory as follows. Let Σ be an underlying alphabet
and Σ∗:= S∞
i=0 Σi its Kleene closure, i.e., the set of strings from Σ. Given the query q, we
denote by X(q) ⊆Σ∗the set of acceptable answers.1 We assume the communication system
depicted in Fig. 1 (left), a form of multiple description source coding (Ozarow, 1980; Gamal and
Cover, 1982; Laneman et al., 2005). In this framework, the sender transmits N acceptable answers
(called descriptions) x1, ..., xN ∈X(q)N in parallel through noisy channels. These descriptions
are corrupted according to a distribution P(y1, ..., yN|x1, ..., xN), so that some hypotheses yi may
become unacceptable (yi ∈Σ∗\ X(q)). This “channel noise” is a way to conceptualize the
imperfections of the generator G. On the receiver side, a decoder processes the (potentially) corrupted
descriptions and estimates ˆx = g(y1, ..., yN) using some decoding function g. The overarching goal is
to achieve a low error probability Perr(N; q) := P( ˆX /∈X(q) | q) for any query q. By bounding the
maximal probability of error (over all queries), the average error probability is automatically bounded
(Cover and Thomas, 2006, §8). In this paper, we focus on rerankers as the decoding functions, where
g(y1, ..., yN) returns the top ranked answer, i.e., g(y1, ..., yN) = yi for some i ∈[N].

We formalize this construction by considering different models for G and R in the following sections,
studying the conditions under which the resulting protocol is asymptotically error-free:

Definition 1. A protocol is asymptotically error-free if, for any query q, the probability of the
decoder outputting an unacceptable answer approaches zero as N tends to infinity, i.e.,

lim
N→∞P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | q)
|
{z
}
:=Perr(N;q)

= 0.
(1)

For simplicity, we assume that X1, ..., XN are conditionally independent given the query q, i.e., that
P(x1, ..., xN|q) = QN
i=1 P(xi|q).2 We also assume that Y1:N are independent from q given X1:N
such that q →X1:N →Y1:N forms a Markov chain. Taken together, these two assumptions mean
that P(x1:N, y1:N|q) = P(x1:N|q)P(y1:N|x1:N) =
QN
i=1 P(xi|q)

P(y1:N|x1:N).

3
Generator-Reranker Systems with Independent Hypotheses

We first consider the case where the corrupted descriptions Y1:N are conditionally independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) given X1:N and where Yi depends only on Xi, that is, P(y1:N|x1:N) =
QN
i=1 P(yi|xi). Conceptually, this is the scenario where the parallel channels do not interfere, and it
corresponds to the graphical model shown in Fig. 1 (right) without the part in red. While this case
may not be very realistic in practice—for example, when the hypotheses produced by the generator
are all sampled from the same model—it makes the analysis simpler. We will show later in §4 how the
analysis can be extended when this assumption does not hold, reusing the results from this section.

In the sequel, given a query q, we let ϵ denote the probability of a hypothesis being unacceptable,
ϵ := P(Yi /∈X(q) | Xi = xi, q) = P(Yi /∈X(q) | Xi = xi).

3.1
Perfect and random rerankers

We start by assuming that R is a perfect reranker, which implies that it produces an acceptable
output when presented with a set of N hypotheses if and only if at least one of them is acceptable. In

1A key difference between our framework and most lossless communication systems is that there is no
need to communicate a specific message—any answer in the equivalence class X(q) is acceptable, hence, if
the decoder recovers any message in this set, the communication is considered successful. This is a natural
conceptualization in problems involving natural language (where a paraphrase of a correct answer is still correct)
or code (where multiple programs might lead to the same execution).
2In fact, all results in this paper still hold if there are dependencies between X1, ..., XN.

this case, the error probability becomes

Perr(N; q) = P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | q) = EX1:N|q

(2)

Thus, Perr(N; q) goes to zero exponentially fast with N for any ϵ ∈[0, 1), indicating that when the
hypotheses are independent and the reranker is perfect, the protocol is error-free.

On the other end of the spectrum, if the reranker is random—i.e., if it selects one of the N hypotheses
uniformly at random, we obtain

Perr(N; q) = P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | q) = EX1:N|q

that is, we obtain the same error probability as the generator alone, as expected.

3.2
Imperfect reranker: Mallows model

We consider now more realistic rerankers. A statistical ranking model widely used in machine
learning applications is the Mallows model (Klementiev et al., 2008, 2009; Chierichetti et al., 2018;
Tang, 2019). Let Π denote the set of permutations over N elements, and let d : Π × Π →R+ be
a distance function between permutations. In this paper, we use the Kendall-tau distance d(π, π′),
which returns the number of adjacent transpositions needed to turn π into π′. Given a location
parameter π0 ∈Π and a scale parameter λ ∈R+, the probability of a ranking π according to the
Mallows model is P(π; π0, λ) = exp(−λd(π, π0))/Z(λ), where Z(λ) is the partition function.

In our setting, we assume that π0 is the ground truth (oracle) ranking3 of the hypotheses y1, ..., yN
and π is the ranking obtained by the reranker model, so that P(π; π0, λ) expresses how imperfect
the reranker might be. Note that the family of Mallows models include both perfect and random
rerankers as limit cases, respectively as λ →+∞and as λ = 0.4

Let ηj denote the marginal probability that the reranker places at the top the jth highest ranked
hypothesis according to the oracle, i.e., ηj = P(π0(π−1(1)) = j). When K out of the N hypotheses
are unacceptable, the reranker will pick an unacceptable hypothesis with probability PN
j=N−K+1 ηj.
Combining this with the fact that the probability of G generating K unacceptable hypotheses is a
binomial distribution, the error probability becomes

Perr(N; q) = P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | q) = EX1:N|q

Note that (4) holds for any reranker with top-1 (marginal) probability mass function η = [η1, ..., ηN],
not only Mallows models. Naively determining η would require marginalizing P(π; π0, λ) by
summing over all permutations π satisfying π0(π−1(1)) = j, which is intractable due to the factorial
number of terms involved. Fortunately, tractable combinatorial expressions exist for Mallows models
(Fligner and Verducci, 1986; Lebanon and Mao, 2008): the partition function has the compact
expression Z(λ) = QN
j=1(1 −e−λj)/(1 −e−λ), and we have (Lebanon and Mao, 2008, Prop. 5):

ηj = Z−1(λ)

π:j=π0(π−1(1))
e−λd(π,π0) =
e−λ(j−1)

r=1 e−λ(r−1) .
(5)

3More specifically, we assume that the hypotheses are ranked according to some quality metric compatible
with X(q), that is, unacceptable answers should be ranked after acceptable answers.
4Notably, e−λ strictly between 0 and 1 correspond to imperfect rerankers that are better than random. Lower
values indicate higher-quality rerankers, making e−λ an inverse measure of reranker quality.

(6)

Notably, when λ →+∞(perfect reranking), the failure probability becomes ϵN, as expected (see
(2)), demonstrating the model’s ability to interpolate between scenarios of random reranking (λ = 0)
with a failure probability of ϵ (see (3)), and optimal reranking (λ →+∞) with a failure probability
of ϵN. A plot is shown in Fig. 2 (left), for several values of e−λ ∈[0, 1].

Our next result, proved in App. A.1, shows that, even with an imperfect reranker, an asymptotically
error-free protocol is possible:

Proposition 1. When R is a Mallows reranker, for any λ > 0, the protocol is asymptotically
error-free and the error probability decays exponentially fast, Perr(N; q) = O((e−λ(1 −ϵ)+ ϵ)N).

This result shows that Perr(N; q) converges Q-linearly to zero with rate of convergence e−λ(1 −ϵ) +
ϵ > ϵ. Therefore, Mallows rerankers behave asymptotically as a perfect reranker but where the
generator has an increased error probability.

Given this result, one might wonder whether any reranker “slightly better than random” suffices to
obtain an asymptotically error-free protocol. This it not the case, as the next counter-example shows.
Example 1. Assume a reranker with probability mass function ηj ∝(N −j + 1). The resulting
protocol is not asymptotically error-free; we have Perr(N; q) = O(ϵ2). Therefore, the error is
reduced from O(ϵ) to O(ϵ2) but it is not eliminated. More generally, if ηj ∝(N −j + 1)r for a fixed
positive integer r, we have Perr(N; q) = O(ϵr+1). See App. A.2 for a proof and plots.

Next, we present a class of rerankers weaker than Mallows which still lead to error-free protocols.

3.3
Imperfect reranker: Zipf-Mandelbrot model

For Mallows models (using the Kendall-tau distance), the marginal probabilities (5) can be written
as η = softmax(−λz), where z = [0, 1, ..., N −1]⊤. We now consider transformations that yield
distributions with heavier tails, which we will see later in §5 to be a better empirical fit in several
applications. A known extension to softmax is the γ-entmax (Peters et al., 2019),5 a family of
transformations parametrized by γ ≥0,

γ-entmax(z) := [1 + (γ −1)(z −τ1)]1/(γ−1)
+
,
(7)
which recovers softmax as a limit case when γ →1. In (7), τ is a constant which ensures that
γ-entmax(z) is normalized. When γ > 1, γ-entmax can return sparse distributions (Blondel et al.,
2020). Conversely, when γ < 1, γ-entmax leads to heavy-tailed distributions (see App. A.3).

5Peters et al. (2019) call this α-entmax; we use γ instead not to clash the notation to be introduced in §4.

5


---Page Break---
Let us now consider η = γ-entmax(−λz), where z = [0, 1, ..., N −1]⊤, instead of (5). Letting p :=
1/(1 −γ), b = λ/p, and a = p+τ

λ
−1 (where a is seen here as a normalizing constant that replaces
τ), and assuming a > −1 and γ < 1, we can write the γ-entmax model as ηj = b−p(a + j)−p. Note
that γ < 1 is equivalent to p > 1. This is called a Zipf-Mandelbrot model (Zipf, 1932; Mandelbrot,
1965). This model generalizes the famous Zipf’s law, which applies empirically to many practical
contexts, such as the frequency table of words in a corpus of natural language (Powers, 1998). The
constant a is determined to satisfy PN
j=1 (a + j)−p = bp. When N →∞, the left hand side becomes
the Hurwitz zeta function (Hurwitz, 1882), which equals the Riemann’s zeta when a = 0,

The following result, proved in App. A.4, shows that Zipf-Mandelbrot rerankers (which are weaker
than Mallows rerankers and become the latter when γ →1) still ensure error-free protocols. The
proof makes use of the integral representation of the Hurwitz zeta function (8) and of the dominated
convergence theorem, reusing the result for Mallows models in Proposition 1.

Proposition 2. When R is a Zipf-Mandelbrot reranker, for any λ > 0 and γ < 1, the protocol is
asymptotically error-free.

Fig. 2 (right) shows how this model differs from the one presented in §3.2. Since the reranker is
weaker, the error curves bend causing the error decrease to be slower, but still convergent to zero.

We assume now a more realistic scenario where
the independence assumption of §3 might not
hold.
For example, (X1, Y1), ..., (XN, YN)
might be only exchangeable—this is the case,
for example, when the hypotheses are gener-
ated from G by sampling from a given model,
conditioned on the query.
In communica-
tion theory parlance, this assumes the pres-
ence of channel “interference” that introduces
dependencies between the errors at the var-
ious channels, although permuting the mes-
sages at each channel does not change the
joint distribution.
By de Finetti’s theorem
(Diaconis and Freedman, 1980), exchangeabil-
ity implies that there is some mixture vari-
able h
∈
H such that P(x1:N, y1:N)
=
R

H dP(h) QN
i=1 P(xi|h)P(yi|xi, h).

We assume further that h = (q, τ) can be decoupled into the query variable q, which conditions x, and
a random variable τ, which conditions y, such that P(xi|h) := P(xi|q) and P(yi|xi, h) := P(yi|xi, τ).
This corresponds to the graphical model in Fig. 1 (right), including the part in red. We let τ be a
continuous random variable in [0, 1] such that E[τ] = ϵ = P(Yi ̸= X(q) | Xi). A convenient choice
is a Beta distribution with parameters α and β, p(τ; α, β) :=
Γ(α+β)

slower than in the independent case—no longer exponentially but rather following a power law.

which leads to the plot in Fig. 3 for Mallows and Zipf-Mandelbrot models.6

The next result, proved in App. A.6, shows that the dependencies considered in this subsection do not
compromise the error-free protocol when it exists for any density p(τ) which is finite in (0, 1) (not
necessarily a Beta distribution). The proof invokes the dominated convergence theorem to enable
commuting the limit with the integral sign.

Proposition 4. Let Gτ be a generator producing independent hypotheses (§3) where each hy-
pothesis is acceptable with probability 1 −τ. Let the reranker R be such that (Gτ, R) has error
probability P indep
err
(N; q, τ) →0 for every τ ∈(0, 1) (i.e., it is asymptotically error-free). Assume
that the function τ 7→P indep
err
(N; q, τ) is measurable for every N ∈N. Then, when R is used with
a generator G which produces exchangeable hypotheses with arbitrary distribution p(τ), finite in
(0, 1), the system (G, R) is still asymptotically error-free.

This result has important implications: it tells us that, to design error-free protocols, it is sufficient to
verify if they are error-free in the simpler case where hypotheses are independent.

Experiments

In this section, we demonstrate the validity of our reranking laws on two different tasks:7 text-to-code
generation (§5.1) and machine translation of medical data (§5.2). Following existing literature on
scaling laws for language modeling, we fit all curves on the development set using least squares
(Ghorbani et al., 2022, App. E) and plot them on the unseen test set.8 In all cases, we consider
the generalized model presented in §4 with parameters α, β, and a Zipf-Mandelbrot reranker with
parameters γ, and e−λ, which becomes a Mallows reranker when γ →1. This is done in two steps:
first, we fit α and β using the data for the perfect reranker (e−λ = 0). Then, we fit γ and e−λ
using the already estimated α and β and the data for the imperfect reranker. Our code is available at
https://github.com/deep-spin/reranking-laws.

5.1
Code generation

We use a sanitized version of the MBPP dataset (Austin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023), a widely
used benchmark for evaluating code LLMs, which includes 400 programming problems in Python.
For each problem, the dataset includes ground-truth programs and three test cases with input and
ground-truth output. We split the dataset in two equally sized parts to get development and test splits.

We generate 200 hypotheses with DeepSeek-Coder 7B (Guo et al., 2024) using a sampling temperature
of 1 (see App. B.1 for the prompt template). As in previous work, for simplicity, we use only one test
case for each problem (Shi et al., 2022), and select one candidate by taking a majority vote over the

6Since τ ∼Beta(τ; α, β), we have E[τ] = α/(α + β), which we set to ϵ to match the independent setting
from §3, resulting in β = (ϵ−1 −1)α. Hence, α is our only new free parameter. As α →0+, the hypotheses
become maximally dependent and reranking is hopeless; as α →∞, the scenario reverts to full independence.
7App. B.3 contains additional experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks.
8We use scipy.optimize.least_squares.

for the imperfect reranker with majority voting, which fits the data well, as shown by the red curve.

5.2
Machine translation

We use the TICO-19 dataset (Anastasopoulos et al., 2020), which includes 3071 English sentences in
the medical domain (i.e., COVID-19 related content) translated into 38 languages. We use the official
splits, which contain 971 examples for development and 2100 for testing, focusing on translating
from English (EN) to Portuguese (PT), Spanish (ES), and Russian (RU).

For each source sentence, we sample 50 translation hypotheses with a temperature of 1 from Tow-
erInstruct 13B (Alves et al., 2024) using the prompt template in App. B.2.9 Folowing Farinhas et al.
(2023), we consider two reranking strategies: selecting the best candidate with MBR decoding using
COMET-22 as the utility metric (Eikema and Aziz, 2020; Rei et al., 2022a) and reranking based on
quality estimation using the reference-free CometKiwi (Fernandes et al., 2022; Rei et al., 2022b).
Since we cannot afford to collect human evaluation scores for each sampled hypothesis, we consider
a translation to have a critical mistake (i.e., to be unacceptable) if its COMET-22 score is below 0.85,
and an oracle (perfect) reranker that picks the translation with the highest COMET-22 score.

We follow the described procedure using the data from all language pairs together. Fig. 4 (bottom)
shows the log failure rate on the dev and test sets as a function of N. We get α = 0.1 and
β = 0.46. Additionally, we have γ = 0.182 and e−λ = 0.001 for MBR decoding and γ = 0.001 and
e−λ = 0.005 for QE reranking. See App. B.2 for additional plots showing these curves when the data

9This model outperforms all existing open-source alternatives (even of larger scales) for translating content
between the supported languages and is also competitive with GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023), especially when
combined with MBR decoding (Alves et al., 2024, App. A).

from each language pair is used to fit a separate model. Again, we see a reasonable fit, especially for
the imperfect rerankers, with MBR decoding leading to lower failure rates than reranking with QE.

Discussion and Related Work

We believe the communication-theoretic perspective introduced in this paper might inspire the design
of new protocols for increasing the quality and safety of LLMs. The generator-reranker system studied
in this paper bears resemblance with repetition codes, a very naive (and inefficient) class of error-
correcting codes. Can more powerful designs (Hamming, 1950; Reed and Solomon, 1960; Gallager,
1962; Berrou et al., 1993) inspire more efficient protocols? In machine translation, other forms of
adding redundancy, such as lattice generation (Singhal et al., 2023) and hypothesis recombination
(Vernikos and Popescu-Belis, 2024), suggest that more efficient designs are indeed possible.

Recent work also suggests that LLM-based evaluators could be used as highly effective rerankers in
specific tasks (Kim et al., 2024). While LLMs are not yet ready to fully replace human evaluators
across diverse NLP tasks (Bavaresco et al., 2024), in some cases, they can even provide fine-grained
assessments in addition to single scores (Kocmi and Federmann, 2023; Fernandes et al., 2023a).

Another class of communication systems allow for feedback, e.g., in “automatic repeat request”
protocols (Lin et al., 1984), where the receiver has a backchannel to request the sender to retransmit
missing bits of information. This framework can be useful to analyze LLM protocols where the
generator generates a varying number of hypotheses interactively, relying on feedback from another
module, such as a reward model or a confidence estimator, as in Quach et al. (2023). Communication
with feedback was also used recently by Jung et al. (2024) for summarization when the generator error
probability ϵ is large—our mild conditions for asymptotically error-free protocols (Propositions 1–4)
suggest that “bootstrapping” a correct answer is possible even in scenarios where G is very weak.
Additionally, recent work has shown that LLMs may struggle with planning or self-verification,
advocating instead for tighter integration between LLMs and external model-based verifiers (Kamb-
hampati et al., 2024). This supports our view that using external feedback models can improve LLMs
by enabling interactive, error-correcting communication.

We provide reranking laws, which allow us to predict how many hypotheses are necessary to achieve
a desired error probability. This links to a rich body of literature aiming to predict the performance of
deep learning models in terms of fundamental parameters, such as the model size or the amount of
compute and data used to train them (Hestness et al., 2017, 2019). These so called “neural scaling
laws” have been studied in the context of language modeling (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al.,
2022) and machine translation (Ghorbani et al., 2022; Fernandes et al., 2023b), where we observe
a power-law scaling for the performance as a function of each fundamental parameter. Our paper
complements this line of work by considering the decoding dimension for generator-reranker systems.

The analysis and theoretical results of this paper focus on binary acceptable/unacceptable decisions;
however it is possible to extend our framework to consider also continuous quality metrics (such as
COMET scores for translation (Rei et al., 2020)) by replacing the notion of “asymptotically error-free”
protocol (Definition 1) by a more general concept associated to a quality target. A possible path is to
posit a probability density for the continuous quality metric (instead of a Bernoulli error probability)
for each hypothesis coming from the generator, such as a Gaussian or uniform distribution with some
input-dependent parameters. For a perfect reranker and independent hypotheses, the resulting output
after reranking would be distributed according to the corresponding extreme value distribution (this
models the distribution of the highest evaluation metric score among the N hypotheses). Extreme
value distributions are an important subject of study in order statistics (David and Nagaraja, 2004)
and their densities have closed form expressions in some restricted cases: for example, the Gaussian
assumption above yields a Gumbel distribution, and a uniform assumption yields a Beta distribution.
The asymptotic case (N →∞) corresponds to one of Gumbel, Fréchet or Weibull families (this is
a consequence of the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem (David and Nagaraja, 2004)). From the
extreme value distribution, we can obtain the expected evaluation metric score or the probability
of a quality score being below an acceptable threshold. However, the generalization to imperfect
rerankers (such as the Mallows or Zipf-Mandelbrot rerankers described in §3.2 and 3.3) seems harder
than in the binary case and requires further investigation.

Conclusions

We presented a communication-theoretic perspective of generator-reranker LLMs, where the generator
G is conceptualized as a sender transmitting N descriptions in parallel through noisy channels, and
the reranker R decodes the message by selecting the most appropriate description. Under mild
conditions, the combined system (G, R) yields an acceptable answer almost surely when N →∞.
Experiments on text-to-code generation and machine translation with LLMs validate our framework.

Limitations and Broader Impacts

We regard our paper as a first step connecting communication theory and LLMs, as discussed in §6.
However, it should be noted that our work has several limitations. First, the guarantees of error-free
protocol in Propositions 1–4 are only asymptotic, and in certain cases a large N may be necessary to
achieve a large enough error decrease. We provide convergence rates only for Mallows rerankers (with
independent hypotheses and also in the dependent case, when combined with a Beta prior). Second,
there is no simple recipe to determine if the Mallows and Zipf-Mandelbrot reranker models are a
good empirical fit to concrete rerankers. The same applies to the prior distribution p(τ) which makes
hypotheses dependent. Third, while our experiments in §5 suggest a reasonable fit in two tasks (code
generation and machine translation), the fit is not perfect. A challenge is that, for large N, errors are
rare events, and therefore prone to statistical inaccuracies (this is visible in the “steps” observed in the
code generation plots). Finally, although our framework focuses on binary acceptable/unacceptable
decisions, it can be extended to continuous evaluation metrics, but this would require modifications to
some concepts (e.g., the notion of asymptotically error-free protocols). Despite these limitations, the
binary case remains highly relevant in practice—for example, in code generation, where the output
either executes correctly or it does not. We expect future work to overcome some of these limitations.

In considering the broader impact of our work, it is crucial to acknowledge its early stage and
predominantly theoretical nature, which lends the discussion a speculative quality. We believe
that our research can significantly enhance the reliability of LLMs by facilitating the identification
of potential system failures, holding promise in fields such as natural language processing and
computer vision, where robustness and error prediction are paramount. While not directly addressing
environmental concerns shared across different LLMs (Strubell et al., 2019), our work could indirectly
contribute to energy efficiency efforts by quantifying the efficiency of reranking methods, potentially
reducing computational requirements while maintaining requisite quality thresholds during inference.

Proofs and Visualizations

A.1
Proof of Proposition 1

Let λϵ := −log
 
e−λ(1 −ϵ) + ϵ

and define F(N) = log Perr(N; q) = e−λϵN−e−λN

1−e−λN
. Observe
that 0 < λϵ < λ for any λ > 0 and ϵ ∈(0, 1). We extend the domain of F to the real numbers in
[1, +∞). We will prove that F(N) is decreasing and that limN→∞F ′(N) = −λϵ. This shows that
Perr(N; q) →0 at asymptotic rate e−λϵ. We have

F ′(N) = (e−λϵN −e−λN)′

e−λϵN −e−λN
−(1 −e−λN)′

1 −e−λN
= −λϵe−λϵN + λe−λN

e−λϵN −e−λN
−
λe−λN

1 −e−λN ≤0,

hence F(N) is decreasing. Since the second term tends to zero, the limit is given by the first term:

lim
N→∞F ′(N) = lim
N→∞
−λϵe−λϵN + λe−λN

e−λϵN −e−λN
= lim
N→∞
−λϵ
1 −e(−λ+λϵ)N +
λ
e(−λϵ+λ)N −1 = −λϵ,

where we used the fact that e(−λ+λϵ)N →0 and e(−λϵ+λ)N →+∞. This proves the desired claim,
that is, the error probability decreases exponentially fast with rate e−λϵ. Note that, for a perfect
reranker (λ →∞), we get e−λϵ = ϵ and we recover the rate ϵN seen in §3.1.

A.2
Proof of Example 1

We first provide a proof for r = 1. We have PN
j=N−K+1 ηj = PK
j=1 ηN−K+j =

PK
j=1 j
PN
j=1 j = K(K+1)

N(N+1).

Plugging this into Eq. (4), we obtain

Perr(N; q) =

N
X

K=0

N
K


ϵK(1 −ϵ)N−K K2 + K

N 2 + N = EK∼B(N,ϵ)[K2 + K]

Figure 6: Two-dimensional γ-entmax([z, 0])1.

When γ > 1, γ-entmax can return sparse dis-
tributions (Blondel et al., 2020). This case has
been extensively studied as a way to, e.g., filter
large output spaces (Correia et al., 2020; Peters
and Martins, 2021) or to produce more inter-
pretable predictions (Correia et al., 2019; Mar-
tins et al., 2020, 2021, 2022). Conversely, when
γ < 1, γ-entmax leads to distributions with
heavier tails, which is the case of our interest,
as described in §3.3. See Fig. 6 for an illustra-
tion of γ-entmax for different values of γ in the
two-dimensional case. For γ > 1, all mappings
saturate at z = ±1/γ −1; this does not happen
for γ ≤1.

e(a+1)t(1−e−t) (cf.

bpΓ(p)

e(a+1)t(1−e−t). Since
fN(t) →0 pointwise for t ∈]0, ∞[ and it is bounded in that interval, we can invoke the dominated
convergence theorem to commute the limit and integral sign. We then have that Perr(N; q) →0.

A.5
Proof of Proposition 3

Let us consider first the case where β = 1. Then,

Perr(N; q) =

N
Y

i=1

α + i −1
α + β + i −1 =
α
α + 1
α + 1
α + 2 · · · α + N −1

α + N
=
α
α + N →0.

Now consider the case where β > 1. We have for each term in the product that
α+i−1
α+β+i−1 < α+i−1

α+i ,
hence we must have Perr(N; q) <
α
α+N . Since the sequence is positive (since all terms are positive)
and decreasing (since all terms are < 1), we must also have Perr(N; q) →0 when β > 1.

Finally, let us analyze the case where 0 < β < 1. From (9), we have

Perr(N; q) = Eτ[τ N] =
Z 1

We invoke Gautschi’s inequality, which states that x1−s < Γ(x+1)

Γ(x+s) < (x + 1)1−s for any x and
s ∈(0, 1). We set s := 1 −β and x := α + β + N −1, from which we obtain the desired result.

To show that the error probability decays as a power law for any β > 0, we use Stirling’s formula,
which states that

Proof of Proposition 4

Let P indep
err
(N; q, τ) denote the error probability of the generator-reranker system when the hypotheses
are independent and each hypothesis produced by G has error probability τ. The error probability of
the generator-reranker system with exchangeable hypotheses is given by

Perr(N; q) = P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | q) = EX1:N|q

P(g(Y1, ..., YN) /∈X(q) | X1:N, q)

Therefore, limN→∞Perr(N; q) = limN→∞

err
(N; q, τ). Since P indep
err
(N; q, τ) ∈
[0, 1] for any N ∈N and τ ∈[0, 1], we have that p(τ)P indep
err
(N; q, τ) ∈[0, p(τ)], and there-
fore the integrand is bounded by p(τ), which integrates to 1.
Therefore we can invoke the
dominated convergence theorem and switch the limit and integral signs. Since by assumption
limN→∞P indep
err
(N; q, τ) = 0 pointwise for any τ ∈(0, 1), we obtain limN→∞Perr(N; q) =
R 1
0 dτ p(τ) limN→∞P indep

(N; q, τ) = 0.

MBR-exec.
We use MBR-exec, an approach proposed by Shi et al. (2022) that consists of (1)
sampling programs from an LLM, (2) executing each program on one test case, and (3) selecting the
example with the minimal execution result-based Bayes risk. We use a 0/1 matching loss between
execution results, and the Bayes risk of a program is defined by the sum of the loss between itself and
the other sampled programs (the ground-truth program output is not used). We break ties by selecting
the program with the smallest sampling index, corresponding to a random selection. See Shi et al.
(2022, Section 3) for more details.

B.2
Machine translation

Licenses.
We use TowerInstruct 13B (Alves et al., 2024), which is released under a CC-BY-NC-4.0
license. We report results on the TICO-19 dataset (Anastasopoulos et al., 2020), publicly available
through a Creative Commons CC0 license.

Prompt template.
We generate hypotheses with TowerInstruct 13B (Alves et al., 2024) using the
following prompt template:

<|im_start|>user

source

to
[target
language]:
[source language]: [source sentence]
[target language]: <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

Visualizations.
In §5.2 we obtained a single reranking law for the all language pairs; we now fit
different models for each language pair. Fig. 7 shows the log failure rate on the dev and test sets as a
function of N for EN-PT, EN-ES, and EN-RU. While the fits on the dev set are good, there is some
degradation on the test set, especially for EN-ES (oracle and MBR decoding), possibly due to a shift
in the distribution of scores/errors. We leave the investigation of more robust techniques and how to
adapt to these cases for future work.

B.3
Mathematical and commonsense reasoning

Our approach is fully general and can be useful in other domains other than code and language
generation. In this subsection, we present additional experiments on mathematical and commonsense
reasoning benchmarks, as prior work has shown that generating multiple hypotheses as an intermediate
step is also advantageous in these scenarios (Wang et al., 2023).

We use samples generated by Aggarwal et al. (2023) with code-davinci-002, a GPT-3-based model
with 175 billion parameters (Brown et al., 2020) which is part of the Codex series (Chen et al., 2021)
(please refer to their Section 4 for more details; these samples were made publicly available by the
authors at https://github.com/Pranjal2041/AdaptiveConsistency). We apply self-consistency over
diverse reasoning paths (Wang et al., 2023), selecting the most frequent answer in the candidate set,
and report results on the SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) and StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) datasets.
Following §5.1, we split the datasets in two equally sized parts to get development and test splits.

Similarly to Fig. 4, Fig. 8 shows the log failure rate on the dev and test sets (left and right, respectively)
as a function of N, confirming that the same trends hold also for these two additional tasks.

B.4
Computing infrastructure

Our insfrastructure consists of 2 machines, each equipped with 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs (46GB)
and 12 Intel Xeon Gold 6348 CPUs (2.60GHz, 1TB RAM). The machines were used interchangeably,
and all experiments were executed on a single GPU.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and the introduction state our assumptions and contributions. We
summarize them in bullet points in §1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of our work in §8.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

26


---Page Break---
Justification: We state the full set of assumptions of our theoretical results (Propositions 1–4)
and include complete proofs in App. A. We provide short proof sketches in the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all the information needed to reproduce our results in §5 and
App. B. Our code is available at https://github.com/deep-spin/reranking-laws.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

27


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use publicly available data in our experiments (although we are not
introducing new datasets). Our code is available at https://github.com/deep-spin/reranking-
laws, with a CC-BY 4.0 license.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all the details in §5 and App. B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: While we do not report error bars, for machine translation, we consider
multiple language pairs and report individual and combined results (see §5.2 and App. B.2).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

28


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include the type of computing resources used in our experiments in
App. B.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the broader impact of our work in §8.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

29


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We are not releasing any data or models.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the creators of the datasets/models used in our paper, including the
name of the corresponding licenses in App. B.1 and App. B.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

30


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our code is available at https://github.com/deep-spin/reranking-laws, with a
CC-BY 4.0 license.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

31


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
