Abstract

We consider the training of the first layer of vision models and notice the clear
relationship between pixel values and gradient update magnitudes: the gradients
arriving at the weights of a first layer are by definition directly proportional to
(normalized) input pixel values. Thus, an image with low contrast has a smaller
impact on learning than an image with higher contrast, and a very bright or very dark
image has a stronger impact on the weights than an image with moderate brightness.
In this work, we propose performing gradient descent on the embeddings produced
by the first layer of the model. However, switching to discrete inputs with an
embedding layer is not a reasonable option for vision models. Thus, we propose
the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient descent step on first layer activations to
construct an activation proposal, and (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first
layer, i.e., those weights which minimize the squared distance to the activation
proposal. We provide a closed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for
robust stochastic training while computing everything efficiently. Empirically, we
find that TrAct (Training Activations) speeds up training by factors between 1.25×
and 4× while requiring only a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the
utility of TrAct with different optimizers for a range of different vision models
including convolutional and transformer architectures.

Introduction

We consider the learning of first-layer embeddings / pre-activations in vision models, and in particular
learning the weights with which the input images are transformed in order to obtain these embeddings.
In gradient descent, the updates to first-layer weights are directly proportional to the (normalized)
pixel values of the input images. As a consequence (assuming that input images are standardized),
high contrast, very dark, or very bright images have a greater impact on the trained first-layer weights,
while low contrast images with medium brightness have only smaller impact on training.

While, in the past, mainly transformations of the input images, especially various forms of normaliza-
tion have been considered, either as a preprocessing step or as part of the neural network architecture,
our approach targets the training process directly without modifying the model architecture or any
preprocessing. The goal of our approach is to achieve a training behavior that is equivalent to training
the pre-activations or embedding values themselves. For example, in language models [1], the first
layer is an “Embedding” layer that maps a token id to an embedding vector (via a lookup). When
training language models, this embedding vector is trained directly, i.e., the update to the embedding
directly corresponds to the gradient of the pre-activation of the first layer. As discussed above, this is
not the case in vision models as, here, the updates to the first-layer weight matrix correspond to the
outer product between the input pixel values and the gradient of the pre-activation of the first layer.
Bridging this gap between the “Embedding” layer in language models, and “Conv2D” / “Linear” /
“Dense” layers in vision models, we propose a novel technique for training the pre-activations of
the latter, effectively mimicking training behavior of the “Embedding” layer in language models.
As vision models rely on pixel values rather than tokens, and any discretization of image patches,

Figure 1: TrAct learns the first layer of a vision model but with the training dynamics of an embedding layer.
We illustrate this in an example with two 4-dimensional inputs x, a weight matrix W of size 4 × 3, and resulting
pre-activations z of size 2 × 3. For language models (left), the input x is two tokens from a dictionary of size 4.
For vision models (center + right), the input x is two patches of the image, each totaling 4 pixels. During
backpropagation, we obtain the gradient wrt. our pre-activations ∇z, from which the gradient and update to
the weights W is computed (∆W). The resulting update to the pre-activations ∆z equals x⊤· ∆W. For
language models (left), ∆z = ∇z, i.e., the training dynamics of the embeddings layer corresponds to updating
the embeddings directly wrt. the gradient. Specifically, the update in a language model, for a token identifier i, is
Wi ←Wi −η · ∇zL(z) where z = Wi is the activation of the first layer and at the same time the ith row of
the embedding (weight) matrix W. Equivalently, we can write z ←z −η · ∇zL(z). However, in vision models
(center), the update ∆z strongly deviates from the respective gradients ∇z. TrAct corrects for this by adjusting
∆W via a corrective term (x · x⊤+ λ · I)−1 (orange box), such that the update to z closely approximates ∇z.

e.g., via clustering is not a reasonable option, we approach the problem via a modification of the
gradient (and therefore a modification of the training behavior) without modifying the original model
architectures. We illustratively compare the updates in language and vision models and demonstrate
the modification that TrAct introduces in Figure 1.

The proposed method is general and applicable to a variety of vision model architecture types, from
convolutional to vision transformer models. In a wide range of experiments, we demonstrate the
utility of the proposed approach, effectively speeding up training by factors ranging from 1.25× to
4×, or, within a given training budget, improving model performance consistently. The approach
requires only one hyperparameter λ, which is easy to select, and our default value works consistently
well across all 50 considered model architecture + data set + optimizer settings.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce related work, in
Section 3, we introduce and derive TrAct from a theoretical perspective, and in Section 3.1 we discuss
implementation considerations of TrAct. In Section 4, we empirically evaluate our method in a variety
of experiments, spanning a range of models, data sets, and training strategies, including an analysis of
the mild behavior of the hyperparameter, an ablation study, and a runtime analysis. We conclude the
paper with a discussion in Section 5. The code is publicly available at github.com/Felix-Petersen/tract.

Related Work

It is not surprising that the performance of image classification and object recognition models
depends heavily on the quality of the input images, especially on their brightness range and contrast.
For example, image augmentation techniques generate modified versions of the original images
as additional training examples. Some of these techniques work by geometric transformations
(rotation, mirroring, cropping), others by adding noise, changing contrast or modifying the image in

the color space [2]. In the area of vision transformers [3], [4] so-called 3-augmentation (Gaussian
blur, reduction to grayscale, and solarization) has been shown to be essential to performance [5].
Augmentation approaches are similar to image enhancement as a preprocessing step, because they
generate possibly enhanced versions of the images as additional training examples, even though they
leave the original images unchanged, which are also still used as training examples.

Another direction related to the problem we deal with in this paper are various normalizations
and standardizations, starting with the most common one of standardizing the data to mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 (over the training set), and continuing through batch normalization [6], weight
normalization [7], layer normalization [8], which are usually applied not just for the first layer, but
throughout the network, and in particular patch-wise normalization of the input images [9], which we
will draw on for comparisons. We note that, e.g., Dual PatchNorm [9], in contrast to our approach,
modifies the actual model architecture, but not the gradient backpropagation procedure.

However, none of these approaches directly addresses the actual concern that weight changes in the
first layer are proportional to the inputs, but instead only modify the inputs and architectures to make
training easier or faster. In contrast to these approaches, we address the training problem itself and
propose a different way of optimizing first-layer weights for unchanged inputs. Of course, this does
not mean that input enhancement techniques are superfluous with our method, but only that additional
performance gains can be obtained by including TrAct during training.

In the context of deviating from standard gradient descent-based optimization [10], there are dif-
ferent lines of work in the space of second-order optimization [11], e.g., K-FAC [12], ViViT [13],
ISAAC [14], Backpack [15], and Newton Losses [16], which have inspired our methodology for mod-
ifying the gradient computation. In particular, the proposed approach integrates second-order ideas
for solving a (later introduced) sub–optimization-problem in closed-form [17], and has similarities to
a special case of ISAAC [14].

Method

First, let us consider a regular gradient descent of a vision model. Let z = f(x; W) be the first
layer embeddings excluding an activation function and W be the weights of this first layer, i.e., for
a fully-connected layer f(x; W) = W · x. Here, we have x ∈Rn×b, z ∈Rm×b, and W ∈Rm×n
for a batch size of b. We remark that our input x may be unfolded, supporting convolutional and
vision transformer networks. Further, let ˆy = g(ˆz; θ\W ) = g(f(x; W); θ\W ) be the prediction of the
entire model. Moreover, let L(ˆy, y) be the loss function for a label y and wlog. let us assume it is an
averaging loss (i.e., reduction over batch dimension via mean). During backpropagation, the gradient
of the loss wrt. z, i.e., ∇z L(g(z; θ\W ), y) or ∇zL(z) for short, will be computed. Conventionally,
the gradient wrt. W, i.e., ∇W L(g(f(x; W); θ\W ), y) or ∇W L(W) for short, is computed during
backpropagation as
∇W L(W) = ∇zL(z) · x⊤,
(1)

leading to the gradient descent update step of

W ←W −η · ∇W L(W) .
(2)

Equation 1 clearly shows the direct proportionality between the gradient wrt. the first layer weights
and the input (magnitudes), showing that larger input magnitudes produce proportionally larger
changes in first layer network weights. We remark that a corresponding relationships also holds
in later layers of the neural network, but emphasize that, in later layers, the relationship shows a
proportionality to activation magnitude, which is desirable.

To resolve this dependency on the inputs and make training more efficient, we propose to conceptually
optimize in the space of first layer embeddings z. In particular, we could perform a gradient descent
step on z, i.e.,
z⋆←z −η · b · ∇zL(z) .
(3)

Here, b is a multiplier because L(z) is (per convention) the empirical expectation over the batch dim.

However, now, z⋆depends on the inputs and is not part of the actual model parameters. We can
resolve this problem by determining how to update W such that f(x; W) is as close to z⋆as possible.
Conceptually, we compute the optimal update ∆W ⋆by solving the optimization problem

arg min
∆W ∥z⋆−(W + ∆W) · x∥2
2
subject to
∥∆W∥2 ≤ϵ
(4)

3


---Page Break---
where we (1) want to minimize the distance between z⋆the embeddings implied by the change of W
by ∆W, and (2) want to keep the change ∆W small.

We enforce that weight matrix changes ∆W are small (∥∆W∥2≤ϵ) by taking the Lagrangian of the
problem, i.e.,

arg min
∆W ∥z⋆−(W + ∆W) · x∥2
2 + λb · ∥∆W∥2
2
(5)

with a heuristically selected Lagrangian multiplier λ · b (parameterized with b because the first part is
also proportional to b). We simplify Equation 5 to

arg min
∆W ∥−ηb · ∇zL(z) −∆W · x∥2
2 + λb · ∥∆W∥2
2
(6)

and ease the presentation by considering it from a row-wise perspective, i.e., for ∆Wi ∈R1×n:

arg min
∆Wi ∥−ηb · ∇ziL(z) −∆Wi · x∥2
2 + λb · ∥∆Wi∥2
2 .
(7)

The problem is separable into a row-wise perspective because the norm (∥· ∥2
2) is the squared
Frobenius norm and the rows have independent solutions.

In the following, we provide a closed-form solution for optimization problem (7), which is related
to [17], [18].

Lemma 1. The solution ∆W ⋆
i of Equation 7 is

∆W ⋆
i = −η · ∇ziL(z) · x⊤·
xx⊤

b
+ λ · In

−1
.
(8)

Proof deferred to Supplementary Material A.

Extending the solution to ∆W, we have

∆W ⋆= −η · ∇zL(z) · x⊤·
xx⊤

b
+ λ · In

−1
(9)

and can accordingly use it for an update step for W, i.e.,

W ←W + ∆W ⋆
or
W ←W −η · ∇zL(z) · x⊤·
xx⊤

b
+ λ · In

−1
.
(10)

The update in Equation 10 directly inserts the solution of the problem formulated in Equation 4.
This computation is efficient as it only requires inversion of an n × n matrix, where n in the case
of convolutions correspond to 3 (RGB) times the squared first layer’s kernel size, and for vision
transformers corresponds to the number of pixels per patch. The values of n typically range from
n = 27 (CIFAR ResNet) to n = 768 (ImageNet large-scale vision transformer).

Lemma 2. Using TrAct does not change the set of possible convergence points compared to vanilla
(full batch) gradient descent. Herein, we use the standard definition of convergence points as those
points where no update is performed because the gradient is zero.

Proof sketch: First, we remark that only the training of the first layer is affected by TrAct. To show
the statement, we show that (i) a zero gradient for GD implies that TrAct also performs no update
and that (ii) TrAct performing no update implies zero gradients for GD. Proof deferred to SM A.

The statement formalizes that TrAct does not change the set of attainable models, but instead only
affects the behavior of the optimization itself.

For an illustration of how TrAct affects updates to W and z, with a comparison to language models
and conventional vision models, see Figure 1.

3.1
Implementation Considerations

To implement the proposed update in Equation 10 in modern automatic differentiation frame-
works [19], [20], we can make use of a custom backward or backpropagation for the first layer.

---Page Break---
Standard gradient for the weights:

∇W ←∇zL(z) · x⊤
(11)

implemented via a backward function:

def backward(grad_z, x, W):
grad_W = grad_z.T @ x
return grad_W

For TrAct, we perform an in-place replacement by:

∇W ←∇zL(z) · x⊤·

xx⊤

b
+ λ · In
−1
(12)

i.e., we replace the backward of the first layer by:

def backward(grad_z, x, W, l=0.1):
b, n = x.shape
grad_W = grad_z.T @ x @ inverse(
x.T @ x / b + l * eye(n))
return grad_W

Figure 2: Implementation of TrAct, where l corresponds to the hyperparameter λ.

Details are shown in Figure 2. This applies the TrAct update from Equation 10 when using the
SGD optimizer. Moreover, extensions of the update corresponding to optimizers like ADAM [21]
(including, e.g., momentum, learning rate scheduler, regularizations, etc.) can be attained by using a
respective optimizer and pretending (towards the optimizer) that the TrAct update corresponds to the
gradient. As it only requires a modification of the gradient computation of the first layer, the proposed
method allows for easy adoption in existing code. All other layers / weights (θ\W ) are trained
conventionally without modification. Convolutions can be easily expressed as a matrix multiplication
via an unfolding of the input; accordingly, we unfold the inputs respectively in the case of convolution.

Moreover, we would like to show a second method of applying TrAct that is exactly equivalent.
Typically, we have some batch of data x and a first embedding layer embed, as well as a remaining
network net, a loss, and targets gt. In the following, we show how the forward and backward is
usually written (left) and how it can be modified to incorporate TrAct (right):

z = embed(x)
# first layer pre-act
y = net(z)
# remainder of the net
loss(y, gt).backward()
# backprop

z = embed(x @ inverse(x.T @ x/b+l*eye(n)))
z.data = embed(x)
# overwrites the values
# in z but leaves the gradient as before
y = net(z)
loss(y, gt).backward()
This modifies the input of embed for the gradient computation, but replaces the actual values
propagated through the remaining network z.data by the original values, therefore not affecting
downstream layers. which modifies the input of embed for the gradient computation, but replaces the
actual values propagated through the remaining network z.data by the original values, therefore not
affecting downstream layers. This illustrates interesting relationships: TrAct is minimally invasive,
can be removed or included at any time without breaking the network, and does not have learnable
parameters. TrAct can be seen as in some sense related to normalizing / whitening / inverting the
input for the purpose of gradient computation, but then switching the embeddings back to the original
first layer embeddings / activations for propagation through the remainder of the network.

We provide an easy-to-use wrapper module that can be applied to the first layer, and automatically
provides the TrAct gradient computation replacement procedure. For example, for PyTorch [19], the
TrAct module can be applied to nn.Linear and nn.Conv2d layers by wrapping them as

TrAct(nn.Linear(...))
TrAct(nn.Conv2d(...))

and for existing implementations, we can apply TrAct, e.g., for vision transformers via:

net.patch_embed.proj = TrAct(net.patch_embed.proj)

Setup
For the evaluation on the CIFAR-10 data set [22], we consider the ResNet-18 [23] as well
as a small ViT model. We consider training from scratch as the method is particularly designed
for this case. We perform training for 100, 200, 400, and 800 epochs. For the ResNet models, we
use the Adam and SGD with momentum (0.9) optimizers, both with cosine learning rate schedules;
learning rates, due to their significance, will be discussed alongside respective experiments. Further,
we use the standard softmax cross-entropy loss. For the ViT, we use Adam with a cosine learning

is particularly designed for effective training on CIFAR scales and has 7 layers, 12 heads, and hidden
sizes of 384. Each model is trained with a batch size of 128 on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU with
PyTorch [19].

As mentioned above, the learning rate is a significant factor in the evaluation. Therefore, throughout
this paper, to remove any bias towards the proposed method (and even give an advantage to the
baseline), we utilize the optimal learning rate of the baseline also for the proposed method. For the
Adam optimizer, we consider a learning rate grid of {10−2, 10−2.5, 10−3, 10−3.5}; for SGD with
momentum, a learning rate grid of {0.1, 0.09, 0.08, 0.07}. The optimal learning rate is determined
for each number of epochs using regular training; in particular, for Adam, we have {100→10−2,
200→10−2, 400→10−3, 800→10−3}, and, for SGD with momentum, we find that a learning rate
of 0.08 is optimal in each case. For the ViT, we considered a learning rate grid of {10−3, 10−3.1,
10−3.2, 10−3.3, 10−3.4, 10−3.5, 10−3.6, 10−3.7, 10−3.8, 10−3.9, 10−4}. Here, the optimal learning
rates (based on the baseline) are {100→10−3, 200→10−3.2, 400→10−3.5, 800→10−3.5}.

Results
In Figure 3 we show the results for ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR-10. We can observe
that TrAct improves the test accuracy in every setting, in particular, for both optimizers, for all four
numbers of epochs, and for all three choices of the hyperparameter λ ∈{0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. Moreover,
we can observe that, for SGD, the accuracy after 100 epochs is already better than for the baseline
after 800 epochs. For Adam, we can see that TrAct after 100 epochs performs similar to the baseline
after 400 epochs, and TrAct after 200 epochs performs similar to the baseline after 800 epochs.
Comparing the different choices of λ, λ = 0.05 performs best in most cases.

40 epochs at 0.004, 40 epochs at

ing the first epoch, for a total of 200
epochs. We reproduced each baseline
on a set of 5 separate seeds, and dis-
carded the models that produced NaNs
on any of the 5 seeds of the base-
line.
To make the evaluation feasi-
ble, we limit the hyperparameter for
TrAct to λ = 0.1. Second, we also re-
produce the ResNet-18 CIFAR-10 ex-
periment but with CIFAR-100.
The
results for this are displayed in Fig-
ure 10 in the Supplementary Material
and demonstrate similar relations as the
corresponding Figure 3. Again, all mod-
els are trained with a batch size of 128
on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

Results
We display the results for the
36 CIFAR-100 models in Table 1. We
can observe that TrAct outperforms the
baseline wrt. top-1 and top-5 accuracy
for 33 and 34 out of 36 models, re-
spectively. Further, except for those 5
models, for which TrAct and the base-
line perform comparably (each better on
one metric), TrAct is better than vanilla
training. Specifically, for 31 models,
TrAct outperforms the baseline on both
metrics, and the overall best result is
also achieved by TrAct. Further, TrAct
improves the accuracy on average by
0.49% on top-1 accuracy and by 0.23%
on top-5 accuracy, a statistically very
significant improvement over the base-
line. The average standard deviations
are 0.25% and 0.15% for top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively.

In addition, we also considered training the models with TrAct for only 133 epochs, i.e., 2/3 of the
training time. Here, we found that, on average, regular training for 200 epochs is comparable with
TrAct for 133 epochs with a small advantage for TrAct. In particular, the average accuracy of TrAct
with 133 epochs is 75.94% (top-1) and 93.34% (top-5), which is a small improvement over regular
training for 200 epochs. The individual results are reported in Table 7 in the Supplementary Material.

ImageNet

Finally, we consider training on the ImageNet data set [40]. We train ResNet-{18, 34, 50}, ViT-S and
ViT-B models.

ResNet Setup
For the ResNet-{18, 34, 50} models, we train for {30, 60, 90} epochs and consider
base learning rates in the grid {0.2, 0.141, 0.1, 0.071, 0.05} and determine the choice for each model
/ training length combination with standard baseline training. We find that for each model, when
training for 30 epochs, 0.141 performs best, and, when training for {60, 90} epochs, 0.1 performs
best as the base learning rate. We use SGD with momentum (0.9), weight decay (0.0001), and the
typical learning rate schedule, which decays the learning rate after 1/3 and 2/3 of training by 0.1

each. For TrAct, we (again) use the same learning rate as optimal for the baseline, and consider
λ ∈{0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. Each ResNet model is trained with a batch size of 256 on a single NVIDIA
RTX 4090 GPU.

ResNet Results
We start by discussing the

sion transformers. We present training plots
forResNet-50 in Figure 5. Here, we can ob-
serve an effective speedup of a factor of 1.5
during training, which we also demonstrate
in Table 2. In particular, the difference in ac-
curacy for TrAct (λ = 0.1) with 60 compared
to the baseline with full 90 epoch training is
−0.02% and +0.04% for top-1 and top-5.

ViT Setup
For training the ViTs, we reproduce the “DeiT III” [5], which provides the strongest
baseline that is reproducible on a single 8-GPU node. We train each model with the same hyper-
parameters as in the official source code3. We note that the ViT-S and ViT-B are both trained at a
batch size of 2 048 and are pre-trained on resolutions of 224 and 192, respectively, and both models
are finetuned on a resolution of 224. We consider pre-training for 400 and 800 epochs. Finetuning
for each model is performed for 50 epochs. For the 400 epoch pre-training with TrAct, we use the
stronger λ = 0.1, while for the longer 800 epoch pre-training we use the weaker λ = 0.2. We train
the ViT-S models on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs and the ViT-B models on 8 NVIDIA V100 (32GB) GPUs.

ViT Results
In Table 3 we present the re-
sults for training vision transformers. First,
we observe that our reproductions follow-
ing the official code and hyperparameters
improved over the originally reported base-
lines, potentially due to contemporary im-
provements in the underlying libraries (our
hardware only supported more recent ver-
sions).
Notably, TrAct consistently im-
proves upon our improved baselines. We
note that we did not change any hyperpa-
rameters for training with TrAct. For ViT-S,
using TrAct leads to 36% of the improve-
ment that can be achieved by training the
baseline twice as long. These improve-
ments can be considered quite substantial considering that these are very large models and we
modified only the training of the first layer. Notably, here, the runtime overheads were particularly
small, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25%. Finally, we consider the quality of the pre-trained model outside

λ is the only hyperparameter introduced by
TrAct. Often, with an additional hyperparam-
eter, the hyperparameter space becomes more
difficult to manage. However, for TrAct, the
selection of λ is simple and compatible with ex-
isting hyperparameters. Therefore, throughout
all experiments in this paper, we kept all other
hyperparameters equal to the optimal choice for
the respective baselines, and only considered
λ ∈{0.05, 0.1, 0.2}. A general trend is that
with smaller λs, TrAct becomes more aggressive, which tends to be more favorable in shorter training,
and for larger λs, TrAct is more moderate, which is ideal for longer trainings. However, in many
cases, the particular choice of λ ∈{0.05, 0.1, 0.2} has only a subtle impact on accuracy as can be
seen throughout the figures in this work. Further, going beyond this range of λs, in Fig. 6, we can
observe that TrAct is robust against changes in this parameter. In all experiments, the data was
as-per-convention standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1; deviating from this convention
could change the space of λs. For significantly different tasks and drastically different kernel sizes
or number of input channels, we expect that the space of λs could change. Overall, we recommend
λ = 0.1 as a starting point and, for long training, we recommend λ = 0.2.

4.5
Ablation Study

As an ablation study, we first compare TrAct to patch-wise layer normalization for ViTs. For this,
we normalize the pixel values of each input patch to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This is an
alternate solution to the conceptual problem of low contrast image regions having a lesser effect on
the first layer optimization compared to higher contrast image regions. However, here, we also note
that, in contrast to TrAct, the actual neural network inputs are changed through the normalization.
Further, we consider DualPatchNorm [9] as a comparison, which additionally includes a second patch
normalization layer after the first linear layer, and introduces additional trainable weight parameters
for affine transformations into both patch normalization layers.

We use the same setup as for the CIFAR-10
ViT and run each setting for 5 seeds. The re-
sults are displayed in Figure 7. Here, we ob-
serve that patch normalization improves training
for up to 400 epochs compared to the baseline;
however, not as much as TrAct does. Further,
we find that DualPatchNorm performs equiva-
lently compared to input patch normalization
and worse than TrAct, except for the case of 200
epochs where it performs insignificantly better
than TrAct. For training for 800 epochs, patch
normalization and DualPatchNorm do not im-
prove the baseline and perform insignificantly
worse, whereas TrAct still shows accuracy im-
provements. This effect may be explained by
the fact that patch normalization is a scalar form of whitening, and whitening can hurt generalization
capabilities due to a loss of information [43]. In particular, what may be problematic is that patch
normalization also affects the model behavior during inference, which contrasts TrAct.

---Page Break---
As a second ablation study, we examine what happens if we (against convention) do not perform
standardization of the data set. We train the same ViTs as above on CIFAR-10 for 200 epochs,
averaged over 5 seeds. We consider two cases: first, an input value range of [0, 1] and a quite extreme
input value range of [0, 255].

and avg. over 5 seeds. All other experiments in this work
are trained with data standardization.

We display the results in Figure 8. Here, we ob-
serve that TrAct is more robust against a lack of
standardization. Interestingly, we observe that
TrAct performs better for the range of [0, 255]
than [0, 1]. The reason for this is that TrAct suf-
fers from obtaining only positive inputs, which
affects the xx⊤matrix in Equation 10; however,
we note that regular training suffers even more
from the lack of standardization. When consider-
ing the range of [0, 255], we observe that TrAct
is virtually agnostic to λ, which is caused by the
xx⊤matrix becoming very large. The reason
why TrAct performs so well here (compared to
the baseline) is that, due to the large xx⊤, the updates ∆W become very small. This is more desirable
compared to the standard gradient, which explodes due to its proportionality to the input values, and
therefore drastically degrades training.

In each experiment, we used only a single opti-
mizer for the entire model; however, our theory
assumes that TrAct is used with SGD. This moti-
vates the question of whether it is advantageous
to train the first layer with SGD, while training
the remainder of the model, e.g., with Adam.

Thus, as a final ablation study, we extend the
experiment from Figure 3 (right) by training the
first layer with SGD while training the remain-
ing model with Adam. We display the results in
Figure 9 where we can observe small improve-
ments when using SGD for the TrAct layer.

4.6
Runtime Analysis

In this section, we provide a training runtime analysis. Overall, the trend is that, for large models,
TrAct adds on a tiny runtime overhead, while it can become more expensive for smaller models. In
particular, for the CIFAR-10 ViT, the average training time per 100 epochs increased by 9.7% from
1091s to 1197s. Much of this can be attributed to the required additional CUDA calls and non-fused
operations, which can be expensive for cheaper tasks. However, when considering larger models, this
overhead almost entirely amortizes. In particular the ViT-S (800 epochs) pre-training cost increased
by only 0.08% from 133:52 hours to 133:58 hours. The pre-training cost of the ViT-B (400 epochs)
increased by 0.25% from 98:28 hours to 98:43 hours. We can see that, in each case, the training
cost overhead is clearly more than worth the reduced requirement of epochs already. Further, fused
kernels could drastically reduce the computational overhead; in particular, our current implementation
replaces an existing fused operation by multiple calls from the Python space. As TrAct only affects
training, and the modification isn’t present during forwarding, TrAct has no effect on inference time.

5
Discussion & Conclusion

In this work, we introduced TrAct, a novel training strategy that modifies the optimization behavior
of the first layer, leading to significant performance improvements across a range of 50 experimental
setups. The approach is efficient and effectively speeds up training by factors between 1.25× and
4× depending on the model size. We hope that the simplicity of integration into existing training
schemes as well as the robust performance improvements motivate the community to adopt TrAct.

A necessary condition for a minimum of the functional

F(∆Wi) = (−ηb ∇ziL(z) −∆Wix)2 + λb (∆Wi)(∆Wi)⊤

is that ∇∆WiF(∆Wi) vanishes:

∇∆WiF(∆Wi)
=
∇∆Wi(−ηb ∇ziL(z) −∆Wix)2 + λb∇∆Wi((∆Wi)(∆Wi)⊤)
=
2(−ηb ∇ziL(z) −∆Wix)(∇∆Wi(−ηb ∇ziL(z) −∆Wix)) + 2λb ∆Wi
=
2(−ηb ∇ziL(z) −∆Wix)(−x)⊤+ 2λb ∆Wi

=
2(ηb ∇ziL(z) + ∆Wix) x⊤+ 2λb ∆Wi

0.

It follows for the optimal ∆W ⋆
i that minimizes F(∆Wi)

ηb (∇ziL(z)) x⊤+ ∆W ⋆

⇔

Lemma 2. Using TrAct does not change the set of possible convergence points compared to vanilla
(full batch) gradient descent. Herein, we use the standard definition of convergence points as those
points where no update is performed because the gradient is zero.

Proof. First, we remark that only the training of the first layer is affected by TrAct. To show the
statement, we show that (i) a zero gradient for GD implies that TrAct also performs no update and
that (ii) TrAct performing no update implies zero gradients for GD.

(i) In the first case, we assume that gradient descent has converged, i.e., the gradient wrt. first layer
weights is zero ∇W L(W) = 0. We want to show that, in this case, our proposed update is also zero,
i.e., ∆W ⋆= 0. Using the definition of ∆W ⋆from Equation 9, we have

∆W ⋆= −η · ∇zL(z) · x⊤·
xx⊤

b
+ λ · In

−1

(15)

= −η · 0 ·
xx⊤

b
+ λ · In

−1
= 0 ,
(16)

which shows this direction.

(ii) In the second case, we have ∆W ⋆= 0 and need to show that this implies ∇W L(W) =
0. For this, we can observe that
 
xx⊤/ b + λ · In
−1 is PD (positive definite) by definition and

13

also exists. If ∆W ⋆= 0, then

0 = ∆W ⋆= ∆W ⋆

b
+ λ · In



= −η · ∇zL(z) · x⊤= −η · ∇W L(W) ,
(18)

which also shows this direction.

Overall, we showed that if gradient descent has converged according to the standard notion of a zero
gradient, then our update has also converged and vice versa.

Additional Results

We display additional results in Figures 10, 11, and 12 as well as in Tables 6 and 7.

As an additional experiment, in order to verify the applicability of TrAct beyond training / pre-training,
we train Faster R-CNN models [44] on PASCAL VOC2007 [45] using a VGG-16 backbone [29].
However, Faster R-CNN uses a pretrained vision encoder where the first 4 layers are frozen. In order
to enable TrAct, as TrAct only affects the training of the first layer, we unfreeze these first layers
when training the object detection head. The mean average precision (mAP) on test data for the
vanilla model versus TrAct training are shown in Table 5.

Table 5: Mean average precision (mAP) on test data
for Faster R-CNN [44] with a VGG-16 backbone on
PASCAL VOC2007 [45], averaged over 2 seeds.

We can observe that TrAct performs better than the vanilla method by about 1.1%. We would like to
point out that, while is TrAct especially designed for speeding up pretraining or training from scratch,
i.e., when actually learning the first layer, we find that it also helps in finetuning pretrained models.
Here, a limitation is of course that TrAct requires actually training the first layer.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We address all claims made in the abstract and introduction in the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All assumptions are pointed out in the work. Limitations are discussed.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All assumptions are provided. Proofs are provided in the SM.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimen-
tal results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss all experimental parameters necessary for reproduction.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code will be made publicly available at github.com/Felix-Petersen/tract.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All training details are either explicitly discussed in the main paper or inherited from
the references.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Standard deviations are reported and correctly defined, described as such, and utilize
Bessel’s correction. In some experiments, we display each seed’s accuracy. In the ImageNet ViT
experiments, running multiple seeds was not feasible due to compute cost.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experi-
ments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe the hardware for each experiment and a provide runtime analysis section.

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All utilized assets (data sets, models, and code bases) are cited.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details
about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
