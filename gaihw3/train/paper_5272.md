Abstract

Quantization of large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges, par-
ticularly due to the presence of outlier activations that impede efficient low-bit
representation. Traditional approaches predominantly address Normal Outliers,
which are activations across all tokens with relatively large magnitudes. However,
these methods struggle with smoothing Massive Outliers that display significantly
larger values, which leads to significant performance degradation in low-bit quanti-
zation. In this paper, we introduce DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation
and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and
normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing the rotation matrix, using
specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent
channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation
to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise
variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhanc-
ing model performance. DuQuant simplifies the quantization process and excels in
managing outliers, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines across various sizes
and types of LLMs on multiple tasks, even with 4-bit weight-activation quantization.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) [52, 7, 51] have demonstrated exceptional performance across a
wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their billions of parameters present
considerable deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices, particularly in terms of
memory usage and inference speed [23, 15, 57]. In response to these challenges, network quantization
methods [20, 24] have been extensively explored to minimize memory usage by converting floating-
point parameters into low-bit formats [18, 33, 8], and to expedite inference by quantizing both
activations and weights for accelerating the matrix multiplication process [65, 35, 76].

Among LLM quantization methods, a primary issue is the presence of activation outliers, which
enlarge the quantization step sizes and subsequently cause significant accuracy loss [60]. To mitigate
this problem, current research has developed various methods to address Normal Outliers in
activations, which are persistent in several channels across all tokens [13, 65]. However, besides
Normal Outliers, there exists another type of activation outlier [49, 36], termed Massive Outliers.

These outliers are characterized by their exceedingly high values and limited occurrence in a subset
of tokens, as depicted in Figure 1(b). Unfortunately, existing LLM quantization methods struggle
to effectively address these Massive Outliers. For instance, SmoothQuant [65], despite using a
smooth factor to shift some of the activation outliers to the weight part, still cannot effectively handle
Massive Outliers with extremely large values, as shown in Figure 1(c)(d). OmniQuant [48] and
AffineQuant [40], on the other hand, exhibit training instability issues [35] due to the presence of
Massive Outliers. Consequently, there is a pressing need for an LLM quantization approach that
effectively addresses both Normal and Massive Outliers.

To tackle this challenge, we propose the Dual transformations Quantization (DuQuant) method. Our
motivation is to redistribute the activation outlier values across different channels, facilitating
easier quantization. Specifically, we construct the orthogonal rotation matrix and the orthogonal
permutation matrix. By multiplying these matrices with the activations, we can effectively perform
column transformations on the activations, which in turn allows for the redistribution of outliers.
For the rotation transformation aspect, we first identify specific dimensions of outliers as the
prior knowledge and employ a greedy algorithm to construct the rotation matrix. To enhance
the multiplication efficiency, we utilize diagonal block-wise rotation matrices, with each matrix
responsible for a small portion of the activations. However, this approach may result in uneven outlier
magnitudes across different blocks. Therefore, we propose the zigzag permutation for reordering the
activation channels, which promotes a more uniform distribution across different blocks. Concretely,
we distribute the channels with the highest activations across the blocks in a back-and-forth pattern.
After establishing blocks with uniformly distributed outlier magnitudes, we employ another rotation
transformation to further redistribute the outliers within each block. Note that we multiply the weight
matrix with the transpose of the rotation and permutation matrices at the same time, preserving the
linear layer equivalence and smoothing weights. Theoretical analysis confirms that the rotation and
permutation transformations greatly mitigate quantization challenges induced by outliers.

As a result, DuQuant offers several clear advantages over QuaRot [2]: (1) DuQuant’s optimal rotation
matrix, derived through a greedy search guided by prior knowledge, surpasses QuaRot’s Hadamard
rotation in managing outliers; (2) our unique zigzag permutation significantly reduces activation
variance across blocks, providing a distinct advantage for handling massive outliers; and (3) by jointly
smoothing weights and activations, DuQuant avoids time-consuming GPTQ algorithm in QuaRot.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our DuQuant approach significantly outperforms existing
4-bit weight-activation quantization baselines across various benchmarks. Notably, DuQuant achieves
a 5% improvement in Commonsense QA tasks across all LLaMA model sizes and a 10% increase in
zero-shot MMLU benchmarks for the Vicuna-v1.5-13B. Moreover, in practical applications with the
LLaMA2-7B model, DuQuant not only accelerates pre-filling phase by up to 2.08× but also reduces
memory usage during decoding phase by 3.50×, with minimal impact on performance: only a 0.61
increase in perplexity and a 2.71% drop in accuracy compared to the FP16 model. These results
highlight the effectiveness of DuQuant in enhancing the efficiency and capacity of quantized LLMs.

Motivation

Normal Outliers and Massive Outliers.
Previous works [13, 74, 33] have highlighted the challenge
posed by activation outliers in LLMs for model compression. These outlier features consistently

manifest large values across specific feature dimensions and are present in all token sequences [65],
which we refer to as Normal Outliers. Recently, a distinct type of outlier [49, 36], termed Massive
Outliers, has been observed in LLMs. The primary distinctions between normal and massive outliers
are: 1) Normal outliers persist across all token sequences, whereas massive outliers are confined
to a limited number of tokens. 2) Massive outliers exhibit significantly larger magnitudes, often
surpassing 100 and being approximately 1000 times greater than the median of other activations [49].

In our study, we delve deeper into the impact of these two distinct types of outliers on quantization.

Massive Outliers Exist at the Second Linear Layer of FFN Module.
In contrast to previous
studies [49, 36] that observe massive outliers at the output of Transformer blocks, we first discover
that these extremely large activations exist at the input of the down-projection layer within the FFN
module. As depicted in Figure 1, the input of the down-projection layer in the LLaMA2-7B model
Layer 1 contains a single activation of significant magnitude (approximately 1400). This activation
is isolated to one token and therefore classified as one of massive activations. This phenomenon is
consistently observed across different layers and sizes of models, as illustrated in Appendix I.

Massive Outliers Enlarge Quantization Difficulty.
Although previous studies [65, 48, 40, 1] have
proposed various approaches to eliminate outlier features, they still face challenges in effectively
managing massive outliers. SmoothQuant [65], for instance, attempts to shift the quantization
difficulty from activations to weights by dividing the activation by a per-channel smoothing factor
and multiplying it to the weight matrix. Nevertheless, we observe that this transfer at the input of the
down-projection layer can cause the weights of the down-projection to display noticeable outliers, as
demonstrated in Figure 1 . This issue arises because massive outliers cause the smoothing factor to
become significantly large. Moreover, extremely large outliers can lead optimization-based methods
to encounter problems with loss explosion. Both OmniQuant [48] and AffineQuant [40] have had to
exclude their learnable parameters for the down projection layer due to unstable gradients. Given the
poor accuracy observed with 4-bit quantization, QUIK [1] opts to use INT8 quantization for the down
projection layer and Atom [76] applies INT8 quantization for 128 outlier channels. Consequently,
massive outliers introduce new challenges to the quantization process that existing methods cannot
fully address. This observation has motivated us to develop rotation and permutation transformations,
which effectively handles both massive and normal outliers and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method

In this section, we delve into the distribution of outliers and introduce our proposed DuQuant method.
The DuQuant method is built on two key components: 1) the block-diagonal rotation matrix, tasked
with the local redistribution of feature outliers, and 2) the zigzag permutation, responsible for the
global reordering of outliers across different blocks.

3.1
Preliminaries
As the common modules within each transformer block of LLMs, both Multi-head Self-Attention
(MSA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) fundamentally consist of basic linear layers, which can
be represented as, Y = X · W ∈RT ×Cout. Here, X ∈RT ×Cin is the activation input and W ∈
RCin×Cout denotes the weight matrix. In this paper, we focus on integer uniform quantization [26]
of both activation and weight, aiming to achieve better hardware support. Specifically, the b-bit
quantization process maps the FP16 tensor X to low-bit integer Xq:

Xq = clamp
X

∆

+z, 0, 2b −1

, where ∆= max(X) −min(X)

2b −1
, z = −
min(X)

∆


.
(1)

The notation ⌊·⌉means the nearest rounding operation, ∆is the quantization step size and z represents
the zero point. Following [65, 48, 35, 40], we employ per-token quantization for activation and
per-channel quantization for weight, which entails assigning different step sizes to individual tokens
of activations (∆X ∈RT ×1) and different output channels of weights (∆W ∈R1×Cout).

3.2
The proposed DuQuant Method
To address the Normal Outliers issue stated in Section 2, current quantization methods, such as
SmoothQuant [65] and OmniQuant [65], usually adopt the smooth technique. Concretely, it involves
the utilization of a per-channel smoothing diagonal matrix, denoted as Λ, to scale the input activation
and weight matrix. The adjustment allows us to rewrite the original linear layer as Y = X·W = (X·

Λ)(Λ−1·W). The diagonal element Λj within Λ is computed as Λj = max(|Xj|)α/max(|Wj|)1−α,
where α is a hyper-parameter representing the migration strength. However, despite the ability of
this smoothing technique to shift the quantization challenge from activations to weights, it still faces
difficulties in effectively managing Massive Outliers, as depicted in Figure 1. This challenge stems
from the extremely large massive outliers inducing large scaling factors Λj, which in turn introduce
new outliers in the weight matrix and result in significant performance declines in 4-bit quantization.

According to these findings, we propose the DuQuant method, which includes the Rotation and
Permutation transformations based on the smooth technique. By combining rotation transformation
and channel permutation, our DuQuant method aims to redistribute these features within the activation
space, thereby mitigating the effects of both Normal and Massive Outliers.

The Rotation Transformation.
In contrast to the smooth technique, our aim is to apply a rotation
matrix for row or column transformations, mitigating the impact of both Normal and Massive
outliers. The ideal rotation matrix, denoted as R, should possess the following properties: 1) R is an
orthogonal matrix satisfying RR⊤= I and |R| = ±1. This allows us to reformulate the linear layer
within the transformer as Y = X · W = (XR)(R⊤W); 2) R should be capable of effectively target
the positions of outliers and effectively mitigating them through matrix multiplication. However, due
to the Massive Outliers are usually randomly distributed within the activation space, it is challenging
to directly identify the optimal rotation matrix R capable of mitigating outliers through a single
rotation transformation. To address this problem, we employ a greedy search with prior knowledge to
compute a rotation matrix ˆR, thereby approximating the ideal rotation matrix R. Specifically, the
calculation of ˆR involves the following steps,

◦Identify the feature dimension d(1) where the outlier are primarily concentrated, i.e., d(1) =
arg maxj(maxi |Xij|). Here, Xij represents the element in the i-th row and j-th column of X.

◦Based on the searched dimensions d(1), we construct the rotation matrix as follows,

R1 = Ed(1) ˜RQEd(1),
Q =

1
O
O
Q′


.
(2)

Here, Ed(1) is the switching matrix used to swap the first and the d(1)-th columns of the activation,
and ˜R represents an orthogonal initialized rotation matrix, in which the first row is specifically
uniformly distributed. The motivation behind this is to mitigate outliers in the first column
after the transformation by Ed(1). To further increase the randomness of the rotation operation,

4


---Page Break---
we retain the first column, where outliers have been mitigated, and randomly rotate the other
columns by multiplying them with a random orthogonal matrix Q′.
◦Let N denote the greedy search steps, then the approximated rotation matrix ˆR = R1R2 · · · Rn,
where n = arg mink∈[1:N]
 
maxi,j |(XR1 · · · Rk)ij|

. Each Ri is constructed according to
Eqn. (2) and the identified feature dimension d(i). Appendix G provides detailed pseudo code.

Through this construction manner, we can ensure that the approximated optimal rotation matrix ˆR can
effectively mitigate outliers with large magnitudes, as opposed to merely using a randomly selected
orthogonal rotation matrix. Nevertheless, directly constructing the entire rotation matrix is time-
consuming and results in substantial memory overhead. For fast matrix multiplication, following [64],
we approximate the rotation matrix ˆR ∈RCin×Cin in a block-wise manner,

ˆR = BlockDiag( ˆRb1, ..., ˆRbK),
(3)

where ˆRbi ∈R2n×2n denotes a square matrix of the i-th block, which is constructed following the
three steps mentioned above. And the block numbers K is calculated by K = Cin/2n.
The Permutation Transformation.
Despite adopting the block-diagonal rotation matrix ˆR for its
time and storage efficiency, its focus on local information introduces a potential limitation in further
reducing the outliers. This is because the rotation transformation, conducted within each small block,
cannot integrate the information across different blocks to further minimize outliers. Consequently,
one block may have relatively larger outliers while another block has smaller outliers, resulting in
high variance among different blocks, as shown in Figure 2. This limitation explains that merely
utilizing the block-diagonal rotation matrix is insufficient to effectively reduce the overall outliers.

To effectively mitigate the overall outliers, it is essential to balance the outliers’ magnitudes among
various blocks. Specifically, within each small block, we denote the largest outlier in dimension dj
as Oj. Meanwhile, Mbi represents the mean value of all Oj in the i-th block, where i = 1, 2, ..., K.
Then the variance in activation magnitudes across various blocks can be expressed as,

Var([Mb1, Mb2, ..., MbK]).
(4)

To minimize this variance and further reduce the overall outliers, we introduce the zigzag permuta-
tion. Concretely, we generate a zigzag sequence that starts by assigning channels with the highest
activations to the first block. The process continues by assigning channels with the next highest
activations to the subsequent blocks in descending order until the end of block K. Upon reaching
the final block, the order reverses, starting from the channel with the next highest activation and
proceeding in ascending order. This back-and-forth patterning continues throughout all the blocks,
ensuring that no single block consistently receives either the highest or lowest activation channels.
It is worth noting that the constructed permutation is an orthogonal matrix, which we denote as P,
satisfying the conditions PP⊤= I and |P| = ±1. By employing the zigzag permutation, we achieve
a balanced distribution of outliers across different blocks. This allows us to use an additional rotation
transformation to further smooth the outliers. Figure 2 provides an illustration of outlier mitigation.

The Overall DuQuant Method.
To effectively mitigate both Normal and Massive Outliers, we first
employ the smooth technique to shift the quantization challenge from activations to weights. Next,
we introduce the block-diagonal rotation matrix ˆR to locally redistribute feature outliers within the
activation space. We then propose the zigzag permutation matrix for globally balancing the outliers
across different blocks, followed by another application of the block-diagonal rotation transformation.
To sum up, the linear layers within the transformer can be rewrite as,

Y = X · W = [(X · Λ) ˆR(1) · P · ˆR(2)
|
{z
}

] · [ ˆR⊤
(2) · P⊤· ˆR⊤
(1)(Λ−1
|
{z
}

G−1

·W)],
(5)

where the notation P denotes the orthogonal permutation matrix learned via the zigzag manner, the
ˆR(1) and ˆR(2) represent the first and second block-diagonal rotation matrix, respectively.

Remark 1. It is worth noting that the proposed DuQuant method can simultaneously smooth
the weight matrix. While the commonly adopted smooth technique is effective, it can cause the
weight matrix of the down-projection layer to exhibit pronounced outliers, leading to performance
degradation. However, in the proposed DuQuant method, the rotation transformation we designed is
applied to not only the activation input but also the weight matrix. As a result, the outliers induced
by the smooth technique can be mitigated through our approximated rotation matrix ˆR, yielding a

5


---Page Break---
smoother, more quantization-friendly weight matrix. Moreover, this approach eliminates the reliance
on complex weight quantization techniques, such as GPTQ [18] used in Atom [76] and QuaRot [2].

Remark 2. To further decrease the computation and memory costs, we initially construct the k-th
block rotation matrix ˆRbk, with the k-th block containing the largest outlier. We then assign ˆRbi =
ˆRbk for all 1 ≤i ≤K. This strategy not only effectively mitigates the impact of outliers, but also
reduces the number of block rotation matrices from K to 1, significantly reducing computation and
memory requirements. Importantly, incorporating the invertible matrix G from Eqn. (5) significantly
eases the quantization challenges for X and W. Consequently, the quantization process acts as
Y = (XG)(G−1W) = ˆX · ˆ
W ≈∆ˆX∆ˆ
W( ˆXq −z ˆX)( ˆ
Wq −z ˆ
W).

3.3
Theoretical Analysis
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DuQuant method, we conduct a theoretical
analysis of the rotation and permutation transformations. Theorem 1 shows that within each block,
the constructed rotation matrix effectively mitigates the maximum outlier, thereby reducing the outlier
magnitude through a greedy search. Theorem 2 reveals that the employed zigzag permutation ensures
a balanced upper bound shared among different blocks. This suggests that the zigzag permutation
effectively reduces the variance shown in Eqn. (4) and thus assists the rotation matrix in further
decreasing the outliers. Please refer to Appendix B for detailed proofs.
Theorem 1 (Rotation). For the activation input X ∈RT ×Cin, ˆR ∈R2n×2n is a diagonal block
matrix constructed as per Eqn. (3). For a specific block bi, let Oj(·) represent the maximum outlier
of the j-th dimension dj within the input. Then, we can deduce that,

max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi ˆRbi) ≤
max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi).
(6)

Theorem 2 (Zigzag Permutation). For the activation input X ∈RT ×Cin, it can be divided into K
blocks, where K = Cin/2n. Let Oj denote the max outlier of the dimension dj in X, the reordered
outliers from large to small is expressed as O(1), O(2), ..., O(Cin). Moreover, the Mbi represents
the mean value of all Oj in the i-th block, i = 1, 2, ..., K. Let δ := max{|O(i+1) −O(i)|}, i =
1, 2, ..., Cin−1. Then, following the zigzag permutation described in Section 3.2, the mean value Mbi
within each i-th block consistently satisfies,

Mbi ≤O(1) + (2nK −1)(2n−1 −1)

Models and Evaluations.
We apply our DuQuant on pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA (7B-65B) [52],
LLaMA2 (7B-70B) [53], LLaMA3 (8B, 70B), Mistral, Phi2 and instruction-tuned LLMs: Vicuna-
v1.5 (7B-13B) [10]. We evaluate quantized pre-trained LLMs on language generation tasks and
commonsense QA tasks. Specifically, we assess the perplexity on WikiText2 [41] and C4 [45]
datasets, as well as the zero-shot accuracy on PIQA [6], ARC [12], BoolQ [11], HellaSwag [71], and
WinoGrande [46] datasets. Moreover, we evaluate quantized Vicuna models on MMLU [22] and
MT-Bench [78] benchmarks, as well as their long-form generative capabilities on LongBench [4].

Implementation Details.
In line with prior studies [35, 48, 40], we apply per-token activation
quantization and per-channel weight quantization. Given that W8A8 quantization has been estab-
lished as lossless in precision by SmoothQuant [65], our primary evaluation in this paper focuses on
4-bit and 6-bit quantization for weights and activations. As for details, we quantize all intermediate
activations, excluding the SoftMax output. Moreover, we have developed two types of quantized
models, denoted as DuQuant and DuQuant+LWC . For DuQuant, we employ round-to-nearest quanti-
zation, using a clipping ratio of 0.9 for activations and 0.8 for weights. To improve weight matrix
quantization, DuQuant+LWC integrates the learnable weight clipping (LWC) technique from Omni-
Quant. Concretely, LWC adjusts weights by training parameters γ, β ∈[0, 1] to compute step size
∆= γ max(X)−β min(X)

2b−1
in Eqn. (1). Notably, the smoothing diagonal matrix and the learned weight
clipping factor can be integrated into the quantized weights, introducing no additional computational
or memory costs. More details and hyperparameters are left in Appendix C.

Baselines.
We compare with state-of-the-art (SOTA) weight-activation PTQ methods, including
SmoothQuant [65], Outlier Supression+ [60], OmniQuant [48], QLLM [35], AffineQuant [40], and
Atom [76]. For Atom, we reproduce the results with no group-wise asymmetric quantization.

Appendix D. Table 1 indicates that our DuQuant quantized models notably outperform other baselines
on both the WikiText2 and C4 datasets. Notably, LWC technique further enhances model capacity,
with our DuQuant+LWC achieving comparable performance with FP16 models. Table 2 and Table D1
showcase the zero-shot accuracy of W4A4 quantization on Commonsense QA tasks, where DuQuant
significantly improves the average accuracy. Our method surpasses QLLM by +9%, and Atom by
+5% for all model sizes. These results demonstrate the superiority of our rotation and permutation
transformation, which establishes new SOTA performance by effectively eliminating outlier features.
Quantization of Instruction-tuned Models.
We quantize Vicuna-v1.5 [10] models to assess the
generalizability of our DuQuant. Table 3 illustrates that our quantized models surpass the baselines
across all task categories on MMLU benchmark. For Vicuna-13B, our DuQuant+LWC surpasses Atom
by 10.01% under zero-shot settings and 6.95% under five-shot settings. Moreover, we compare our
DuQuant with Atom and OmniQuant using MT-Bench and utilize GPT-4 to evaluate the answers
from quantized models. As shown in Figure 3, DuQuant quantized models significantly outperform
both Atom and OmniQuant in win rates. Specifically, for Vicuna-7B, DuQuant only lost 16 and 1
times to Atom and OmniQuant, respectively, while achieving 68 and 155 wins against them.
Evaluation of Long-context Generation.
To further evaluate the long-text generative capabilities,
we follow [38, 34, 56] and conduct a comprehensive comparison of DuQuant against state-of-the-art
baselines on the LongBench [4], which includes a variety of generative tasks to provide a broader
evaluation. We set the maximum sequence length to 3500 for Vicuna models, with results presented in
Table 4. DuQuant achieves performance comparable to FP16 models, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our dual transformations. More detailed results on different subtasks are listed in Table D3, D4.

Quantization of LLaMA3 Models.
LLaMA3, known for its superior performance in various tasks,
faces significant degradation in low-bit quantization [25]. To address this, we apply our DuQuant to
quantize LLaMA3-8B. Table 5 displays the perplexity and zero-shot accuracy results. Notably, under
W6A6 setting, our DuQuant achieves performance comparable to FP16 model. Furthermore, unlike
other methods that show weaker results under W4A4 setting, our DuQuant maintains competitive
performance, indicating its robustness with LLaMA3. We attribute this success to the advanced
handling of outliers achieved through dual transformations, which is not restricted to specific models.

Ablation Study

Module-wise Impact.
We ablate four distinct operations within DuQuant: 1) only the smoothing
technology like SmoothQuant; 2) one rotation following the smoothing operation; 3) a sequence
of rotation, permutation, and another rotation without smoothing; and k4) full DuQuant approach.
Table 6 shows that the smoothing operation plays a basic role in our DuQuant by shifting activation
outliers to weight. The initial rotation significantly enhances model performance, yielding competitive
PPL results. Finally, permutation combined with a second rotation further enhances the quantized
model.

Influence of Normal/Massive Outliers.
In this section, we comprehensively explore the influence
of massive and normal outliers on quantization. Notably, we observe that massive outliers primarily
occur at the down-projection of the FFN module. To isolate their effect, we remove the rotation and
permutation transformations, applying only the smoothing technique to all down-projection inputs.
The resulting perplexity for LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA-13B showed significant degradation, presented
in Table 7. Conversely, when we eliminate the rotation and permutation transformations for normal
outliers, the performance decrease was noticeable but less severe compared to massive outliers.
These findings indicate that: 1) massive outliers exert a more substantial impact on quantization,

the influence of outliers, particularly massive ones; and 3) our rotation and permutation methods
prove highly effective against both types of outliers, leading to superior performance.

Comparison with QuaRot [2]
In light of the recent introduction of Hadamard rotations by
QuaRot[2] to eliminate outlier features, we have undertaken a detailed analysis to highlight the
key differences between our DuQuant and QuaRot. To ensure a balanced evaluation, we have re-
implemented QuaRot in accordance with our quantization settings. The results demonstrate that 1)
the rotation matrix constructed by DuQuant outperforms QuaRot’s approach of simply selecting a ran-
domly initialized Hadamard matrix. As depicted in Figure 10, our DuQuant more effectively smooths
activations than QuaRot. This is attributed to the prior knowledge utilized by DuQuant to accurately
target the outliers; 2) As demonstrated by the perplexity in Table 8, QuaRot employs GPTQ for their
weight quantization method, whereas our DuQuant, with its sophisticated outlier management, attains
competitive results using RTN quantization. The superiority proves the effectiveness of our zigzag
permutation to enhance capacity. For a more comprehensive comparison, please refer to Appendix F.

performance compared with “Perm 0” (no permutation), while incurring an additional 8.9% computa-
tional cost on LLaMA2-7B and 9.3% on LLaMA2-13B compared to the W4A4 setup. Considering
the approximately 2× speedup and the impressive performance, these additional costs are deemed
acceptable. Further permutations, like “Perm 2,” do not improve performance and reduce inference
efficiency. Consequently, “Perm 1” strikes the best balance between perplexity and inference speed,
making it the optimal configuration for DuQuant.

Inference Speedup.
To assess the inference speedup delivered by our DuQuant, we adopt the
measurement strategy and W4A4 kernel from [2]. We evaluate the layer-wise speedup of LLaMA2
models on one NVIDIA 3090 GPU, with results detailed in Table 9 and 10. We set the pre-filling
sequence length at 2048 and decode for 128 steps. In the pre-filling stage, DuQuant achieves a 2.08×
speedup over FP16 for LLaMA2-7B and a 2.34× speedup for LLaMA2-13B, with slight variations
across different batch sizes. In the decoding stage, batching the token generation phase yields high
throughput without any downside [44]. Consequently, we enlarge the batch size to 64 and the results
for LLaMA2-7B in Table 10 prove DuQuant achieves speedup comparable to QuaRot. More detailed
analyses and end-to-end speedup are available in Appendix E.1.

Memory Consumption.
We measure the peak memory usage of DuQuant with the W4A4 kernel on
LLaMA2-7B using a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. We process 2048 tokens for pre-filing and run 128
decoding steps, with the results listed in Table 11. In the pre-filling stage, DuQuant, SmoothQuant,
and QuaRot achieve up to 3.2× memory reduction, while QLLM performs worse. In the decoding
stage, DuQuant maintains strong memory efficiency, with superior performance.

Runtime.
Our DuQuant stands out
for its efficiency, surpassing other
baselines [48, 35, 40, 76]. The block-
wise rotation ensures fast multiplica-
tion between the rotation and activa-
tion matrices. Zigzag permutation,
involving simple channel swaps, is much faster than complex algorithms like Simulated Annealing, as
discussed in Appendix E.3. Moreover, the advanced management of outliers makes DuQuant not rely
on GPTQ or gradient-based training. Hence, DuQuant enables a rapid quantization process shown in
Table F24, e.g., we successfully quantize LLaMA2-13B in just 71s with superior performance.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this paper presents DuQuant, an innovative quantization strategy for large language
models (LLMs) that effectively addresses the challenge of outlier activations. By integrating rotation
and permutation transformations, DuQuant effectively mitigates the impacts of both massive and
normal outliers. This strategic redistribution of outliers not only simplifies the quantization process
but also leads to substantial improvements in model performance. Consequently, DuQuant establishes
new state-of-the-art results in 4-bit weight-activation quantization scenarios. This advancement
enhances the deployment of efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

A.1
Network Quantization

Neural networks achieve great success in recent years [32, 66, 72, 39, 62, 19, 63], quantization [1,
64, 68, 76, 58, 77] is a widely utilized technique aimed at reducing model size and memory usage.
Research in this area generally falls into two main categories: quantization-aware training (QAT) [73,
3, 50] and post-training quantization (PTQ) [42, 61, 75]. QAT involves training quantized model
weights using additional data, often with the assistance of a straight-through estimator (STE) [5].
However, the computational cost associated with QAT poses challenges, particularly for large
language models (LLMs) with millions of parameters, which necessitate significant amounts of data
for retraining [37, 16, 9]. In contrast, PTQ has gained popularity for LLMs [55, 23, 70, 59, 38, 21]
due to its efficient approach, involving the training of quantized models using a small amount of data,
known as calibration data [18]. However, PTQ often leads to significant performance degradation,
especially when employing low-bit settings [18, 54, 47, 31]. Consequently, our work focuses on
enhancing the performance of low-bit PTQ quantized models.

A.2
Post Training Quantization of LLM

Post-training quantization for LLMs can be categorized into weight-only quantization [33, 14, 29, 30]
and weight-activation quantization [69, 65, 76]. We focus on 4-bit weight-activation quantization
due to the actual speedup it provides with low-bit quantization kernels [1]. Quantizing LLMs faces
challenges due to activation outlier features persisting across different tokens and layers [13, 65].
Some approaches [13, 76] retain a small portion of crucial outlier channels at high precision (e.g.,
INT8), which poses challenges to hardware compatibility and leads to additional memory footprint.
Other methods [65, 60, 48] attempt to shift quantization difficulty from activation to weight channels.
However, the learnable equivalent transformation in OmniQuant [48] and the affine transform matrix
in AffineQuant [40] exhibit instability as discussed in Section 2. The channel disassembly and
assembly in QLLM [35], coupled with LoRA-tuning, incur significant time costs. Notably, these
methods demonstrate poor performance under W4A4 quantization. We attribute this degradation to
the ineffective handling of outlier features, especially massive outliers. Hence, we propose DuQuant
to effectively eliminate outlier features through rotation matrices and channel permutation, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. In contrast with QuaRot [2] also utilizing Hadamard matrices to enhance
weight-activation quantization, our approach uniquely incorporates knowledge about the actual outlier
channels. Furthermore, unlike QuaRot, which relies on GPTQ [18] for weight quantization, our
permutation transformation has been proven helpful and efficient, facilitating a faster quantization
process. The more detailed analysis and comparison with QuaRot are left in Appendix F. In addition,
unlike RPTQ [70] and SKVQ [17], which use channel reordering to cluster similar activations, our
method employs Permutation transformations with a fundamentally different goal: to evenly distribute
outliers across blocks. This balanced distribution is crucial for enabling effective secondary rotations,
ultimately leading to smoother activations that facilitate easier quantization.

B
Proofs

Theorem 1 (Rotation). For the activation input X ∈RT ×Cin, ˆR ∈R2n×2n is a diagonal block
matrix constructed as per Eqn. (3). For a specific block bi, let Oj(·) represent the maximum outlier
of the j-th dimension dj within the input. Then, we can deduce that,

max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi ˆRbi) ≤
max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi).
(8)

Proof. In the case of a specific block bi, the potential maximum value Oj(Xbi ˆRbi), where Xbi ∈
RT ×2n, can be achieved by ensuring that the different j-th column outliers Oj(Xbi) are located in
the same t-th row of the activation input Xbi. This can be formally defined as follows,

max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi ˆRbi) = O1(XbiEd(1)) ·
1
√

M
+ O2(XbiEd(1)) · δ1 + ... + OM(XbiEd(1))δM,

where M = 2n and ∥1

2n + δ2
2 + ... + δ2
M∥= 1,
( ˆRbiis orthogonal)

Without loss of generality, let’s assume that δi ≥0 and define m := arg maxi δ2
i . Then we can
derive that δm ≥
1
√

2n . Consequently, we can obtain the following inequality,

max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi ˆRbi) = O1(XbiEd(1)) ·
1
√

2n + O2(XbiEd(1)) · δ1 + ... + OM(XbiEd(1))δM

≤O1(XbiEd(1)) ·
1
√

2n + (O2(XbiEd(1)) + ... + OM(XbiEd(1)))δm

(1)
≤O1(XbiEd(1)) ·
1
√

2n + O1(XbiEd(1)) ·

√

2n −1
√

2n
= O1(XbiEd(1))

=
max
1≤j≤2n Oj(Xbi).

(9)
The inequality (1) holds because the switch matrix Ed(1) has swap the largest outliers O1(Xbi) in the
first column, i.e., O1(XbiEd(1)) >
max
2≤m≤MOm(XbiEd(1)).

Theorem 2 (Zigzag Permutation). For the activation input X ∈RT ×Cin, it can be divided into K
blocks, where K = Cin/2n. Let Oj denote the max outlier of the dimension dj in X, the reordered
outliers from large to small is expressed as O(1), O(2), ..., O(Cin). Moreover, the Mbi represents
the mean value of all Oj in the i-th block, i = 1, 2, ..., K. Let δ := max{|O(i+1) −O(i)|}, i =
1, 2, ..., Cin−1. Then, following the zigzag permutation described in Section 3.2, the mean value Mbi
within each i-th block consistently satisfies,

Mbi ≤O(1) + (2nK −1)(2n−1 −1)

2n
δ,
i = 1, 2, 3, ..., K.
(10)

Proof. According to the zigzag permutation described in Section 3.2, and considering the reordered
outliers O(1), O(2), ..., O(Cin), we can redistribute the channels they occupy (i.e., O(i)
c )across different
blocks. Specifically, for the i-th block, it contains the following channels,
bi = {O2mK+i
c
, O2(m+1)K−i+1|m = 0, 1, ..., 2n−1 −1}

= {O(i)
c , O(2K−i+1)
c
, ..., O2nK+K
c
, O(2nK+K+1)}

Since δ = max{|O(i+1) −O(i)|}, i = 1, 2, ..., Cin−1, then we can get

Mb1 = 1

2n {O(1) + O(2k) + ... + O2n−2k+1 + O2nK}

≤1

2n {O(1) + (4K −1)δ + (8K −1)δ + [(2n+1 −4)K −1]δ + (2nK −1)δ}

≤O(1) + (2nK −1)(2n−1 −1)

2n
δ.

(11)

Similarly, we can deduce that all Mbi (i = 1, 2, ..., K) share the same upper bound after applying our
zigzag permutation.

Additional Implementation Details

In this work, all experiments are done on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs for small-scale models and
NVIDIA A100 GPUs for large-scale models. We set sequence length to 2048 for all evaluation tasks.

For calibration data, following [48, 40, 35], we randomly select 128 sampled sequences from the
WikiText2 dataset, with the sequence length of 2048. For rotation and permutation transformations,
the rotation block size 2n is set to 128, and maximum greedy search steps N equals 256. We adopt
once permutation times for efficiency. We conduct detailed ablation studies in Appendix E.2, E.3, E.4.

Regarding quantization details, for multiplications between activations in MSA, such as Query and
Key, attention outputs and Value, we apply a Hadamard rotation matrix for rapid and straightforward
processing. A Hadamard matrix is an orthogonal and symmetric matrix filled with elements ±1/
√

2n.
For smooth parameter α, we set it to 0.6 for DuQuant and 0.5 DuQuant+LWC. We clip the maximum
activation values in all projection blocks, and the clipping ratio is set to 0.9. For DuQuant we also
clip the maximum values in weight matrices, with a clipping ratio of 0.8. For LWC, we keep the same
default epoch numbers of 20, batch size as 1, learning rate as 5e-3, and zero weight decay, as [48].

Zero-shot QA Results for 4-bit LLaMA2 Models.
Table D1 showcases the zero-shot common-
sense QA results for INT4 quantized LLaMA2 models. Our DuQuant method excels across various
model sizes and datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in commonsense reasoning
tasks. For example, DuQuant outperforms Atom by 5.43% for the LLaMA2-7B model and by 5.18%
for the LLaMA2-13B model. In contrast to Atom [76], which relies on GPTQ for weight quantization
and maintains 128 channels at INT8, thereby increasing memory usage, our method offers a rapid
and more efficient weight-activation quantization solution through Rotation and Permutation.

Long-context Evaluation Results.
LongBench [4] is proposed to access the long-context gen-
eration ability of LLMs, which covers several key long-text application scenarios. We evaluate
the 4-bit quantized Vicuna models on five different tasks. Specifically, Qasper, MultiFieldQA, and
NarrativeQA (F1 score) are Single-Document QA tasks; DuReader (Rouge-L score) and 2WikiMulti-
hopQA (F1 score) are Multi-Document QA tasks; QMSum, GovReport (F1 score) and MultiNews
(Rouge-L score) are Summarization tasks; TREC (Accuracy CLS), TriviaQA (F1 score), and SAM-
Sum (Rouge-L score) are Few-shot Learning tasks; and RepoBench-P (similarity score) is Code
Completion task. Table D3 and Table D4 show that our DuQuant outperforms other baselines by a
clear margin, maintaining the ability for long context generation tasks compared with FP16 models.

Comparison with FP16 models on MT-Bench.
We conducted additional comparisons using the
MT-Bench between our INT4 quantized models
and the FP16 models. As shown in Table D5, for
both 7B and 13B models, our DuQuant performs
comparably to FP16, which further underscores
the effectiveness of dual transformations in maintaining high accuracy even with reduced precision.

Results for 4-bit Mistral-7B and Phi2-2.8B.
We have extended the application of DuQuant to
include Mistral [28] and Phi2 [27] under 4-bit WA quantization. From Table D6, we can observe that

19


---Page Break---
DuQuant largely surpasses other baselines, particularly with Mistral-7B. Regarding the Phi2-2.8B
model, it often experiences instability in matrix multiplication between queries and values, leading
to overflow issues and posing great challenges to quantization. However, while DuQuant may not
perform as well as FP models, it still significantly outperforms other baselines. In addition, we have
visualized the massive outliers in the down projection layer of the Mistral-7B model and the feature
space after our dual transformations. These visualizations are shown in Figure I9. It can be observed
that our DuQuant perfectly eliminates these outliers. These results underscore the effectiveness of
our dual transformation approach in addressing massive outliers across various types of LLMs.

Results for 4-bit LLaMA3-70B.
As LLaMA3 models have proven to be sensitive to quantization,
we apply our DuQuant to the LLaMA3-70B and present the results in Table D7. Due to time
constraints, we do not add learnable weight clipping. The results demonstrate that our DuQuant-
quantized models outperform SmoothQuant by 12.9% on Commonsense QA tasks and significantly
reduce perplexity across the WikiText2, C4, and PTB datasets. These improvements underscore the
robustness of our DuQuant method when applied to the LLaMA3-70B model.

W6A6 Quantization Results.
To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of our DuQuant models, we
conduct comprehensive assessments under the W6A6 quantization setting. The perplexity results for
language generation tasks are displayed in Table D8, while the zero-shot accuracy for Commonsense
QA tasks is detailed in Tables D9 and D10. Our findings reveal that DuQuant not only surpasses other
baselines but also achieves nearly lossless performance with FP16 models in these tasks. Interestingly,
in several instances, DuQuant slightly outperforms DuQuant+LWC . This suggests that the Rotation and
Permutation transformations alone are sufficient to create highly competitive quantized models under
W6A6 settings, without the need for additional enhancements such as the learnable weight clipping
(LWC) technique. These outcomes highlight the exceptional versatility and robustness of DuQuant
across various quantization scenarios, confirming its potential as a leading solution in post-training
quantization for large language models.

More Ablation Studies

E.1
Time Speedup and Memory Saving

The current generation of LLMs usually splits into pre-filling and decoding phases and deploys on
two separate machines [44]. Here, we present more speedup and memory-saving results for these
two phases achieved with the LLaMA2-7B model on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. We set the
input sequence length to 2048 and the decoding steps to 256. End-to-end results for time speedup
and memory savings during the pre-filling stage are shown in Table E11 and E12. We can observe
that DuQuant achieves a maximum speedup of 2.01× during the pre-filling phase, with speedup
increasing as the batch size grows. From Table E12, DuQuant demonstrates significant memory
savings, effectively reducing memory usage by up to 3.20× through quantization. For the decoding
phase, we enlarge the batch size to 64 and measure speedup along with memory usage for one
LLaMA2-7B layer, constrained by the 24 GB memory of the GPU. As shown in Table E13, DuQuant
maintains speedup and memory usage comparable to QuaRot. These results underscore the efficiency
of DuQuant in optimizing resource utilization, highlighting its potential to enhance performance and
reduce costs in deploying large language models, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Effects of Rotation Matrix

Ablation of Rotation Block Size.
To further explore the impact of rotation block size, we apply
varying block sizes in the rotation matrices to both LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B models and
evaluate the perplexity of the quantized models. The results, presented in Table E14, indicate that
increasing block sizes generally improves model performance. This improvement occurs because
larger block sizes allow outliers to be distributed across more channels, evening out values throughout
the activation/weight matrix thereby enhancing quantization accuracy and performance. Additionally,
quantization runtime decreases with larger block sizes, likely due to more efficient transformations
during the reshaping of original activation/weight matrices. Consequently, we adopt 128 as our
rotation block size for all experiments for efficiency and effectiveness.

Ablation of Rotation Times.
Identifying the optimal rotation matrix R is a complex challenge, so
we employ a greedy search algorithm to approximate the matrix as ˆR. We conduct an ablation study
on the number of greedy steps N and summarize the results in Table E15. Initially, as N increases,
the model performance improves, reflecting our ability to determine ˆR more effectively. However,
when N reaches 1024, the model begins to overfit. Consequently, we have chosen N = 256 for all
our experiments, as it offers the optimal balance between model performance and time usage.

Effects of Permutation Algorithm.

As discussed in Section 3.2, rotation transformations within each block are limited and unable to re-
distribute outliers across different blocks. To address this, we introduce a permutation transformation
aimed at balancing outliers more comprehensively. Our primary goal is to minimize the variance
among different blocks, as outlined in Eqn. (4). We explore several optimization algorithms, with
the results detailed in Table E16. Note that the variance values are measured on activation values
of the query project in the first layer of each model, and the time in the table represents the runtime
of calibration. The Zigzag permutation notably reduces the variance to 3.0e-4, achieving this with
minimal time expenditure and yielding competitive perplexity results. While Simulated Annealing
slightly outperforms Zigzag in terms of perplexity for the LLaMA2-7B model, it was significantly
more time-consuming, and the marginal gains did not justify the additional complexity. Therefore,
we select Zigzag permutation as our preferred method, leading to smoother outlier distribution and
more effective quantized models.

Effects of Calibration Datasets

Ablation of Different Calibration Datasets.
We apply our DuQuant to quantize the LLaMA2-7B
model using different calibration datasets, with results presented in Table E17. It can be observed
that the selection of calibration datasets has a relatively minor impact on quantization performance.
This is because our method uses the calibration data solely to identify outlier channels, rather than for
gradient-based parameter learning as seen in methods like OmniQuant [48] and AffineQuant [40].
This ablation study underscores the robustness of our DuQuant method.

Calibration-free Quantization.
To further explore the robustness of DuQuant under varying
calibration conditions, we generate random calibration data within the vocabulary range of the model,
setting the sample count to 256. The results, shown in Table E18, indicate that even in calibration-
free settings, our method continues to perform well, achieving results that are competitively close
to those obtained with actual calibration data. This demonstrates that DuQuant could provide a
viable solution in real-world scenarios where obtaining specific calibration data is challenging or
impossible. In addition, our findings suggest that outliers are inherent to certain model layers,
reflecting characteristics of the model weights or modules, especially in recent LLMs. This aligns
with concurrent research: [67] identified consistent massive outliers at the FFN down projection layer
in GLU-based LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, Mixtral, SOLAR, and Gemma, while [43] reported
that, although OPT models are sensitive to different calibration sets, newer models demonstrate
robustness to outliers and maintain stable activations. These insights reinforce the idea that outliers
are more linked to the internal structure of model weights and modules than to calibration data.
DuQuant’s ability to deliver high performance without relying on traditional calibration data creates
opportunities for deploying quantized models in environments with stringent privacy requirements
or limited data availability. This highlights a promising direction for future research, focusing on
improving model adaptability and deployment flexibility.

Ablation of Different Numbers of Calibration Samples.
We utilize our DuQuant to quantize the
LLaMA2-7B model using varying numbers of calibration samples from the WikiText2 dataset, with
results detailed in Table E19. Interestingly, the quantization performance shows a low correlation
with the number of samples, demonstrating the robustness of DuQuant˙This stability arises because
we utilize the mean activation values from these samples to construct our rotation matrices. Since
we average the activations, the influence of any single, potentially non-representative sample is
minimized, ensuring consistent performance. Notably, as we use mean values, the time cost of our
quantization process remains constant regardless of the number of samples, enhancing the efficiency.

In this section, we present a detailed comparison between our DuQuant and QuaRot [2]. QuaRot
employs Hadamard matrices to mitigate outliers in activations and utilizes the GPTQ algorithm for
weight quantization to achieve competitive performance. However, our DuQuant method demonstrates
several distinct advantages:

• Effective Use of Prior Knowledge: DuQuant leverages prior knowledge to accurately target
and eliminate outliers through multiple rotations, achieving a smoother activation distribution
compared to the Hadamard transformation, as demonstrated in Figure 10.

25


---Page Break---
• Efficient Channel Permutation: Our channel permutation not only further smooths outlier
features but also benefits from rapid implementation, enhancing overall performance.

• Simultaneous Weight Matrix Smoothing: Unlike QuaRot, DuQuant directly and efficiently
smooths the weight matrix, avoiding the time-consuming GPTQ algorithm and accelerating the
quantization process, as demonstrated high quantization efficiency in Table F24.

Experimental results underscore the superiority of DuQuant over QuaRot. We first summarize the
experimental setting differences between the original paper of QuaRot with ours in Table F20*. For a
fair comparison, we reproduce the QuaRot under 4-bit per-channel weight and per-token activation
asymmetric quantization. Table F21 displays the perplexity (PPL) and zero-shot accuracy for mod-
els LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA3-8B. Our DuQuant method consistently outperforms
QuaRot-RTN across all benchmarks, showcasing our advanced weight matrix management. Further-
more, compared to QuaRot-GPTQ, DuQuant and DuQuant+LWC achieve better average accuracy across
six QA tasks and demonstrate superior performance on the WikiText and C4 datasets, particularly for
LLaMA3-8B. Moreover, we further provide the results of DuQuant under the setting utilized in the
original paper of QuaRot in Table F22. DuQuant still surpasses QuaRot by a large margin.

Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of the rotation matrices utilized in DuQuant which incorpo-
rate prior knowledge against the Hadamard matrices used in QuaRot. We omit the permutation step
in DuQuant and directly contrast it with QuaRot-RTN. Results in Table F23 show that our DuQuant
without permutation outperforms QuaRot by a clear margin, which confirms that our rotation trans-
formation is more effective than Hadamard by leveraging prior knowledge. It is worth noting that
because a Hadamard matrix is orthogonal and symmetric, it multiplies by itself to yield the identity
matrix. In other words, the Hadamard matrix is not suitable for greedy searches aimed at finding
smaller outliers. These findings differentiate DuQuant from QuaRot and highlight the effectiveness
of our approach in managing outliers for post-training quantization of large language models.

Limitations and Broader Impacts

Limitations.
The primary limitation of our method is the lack of a specialized strategy for calibra-
tion data selection. We adhere to established practices [48, 40, 35, 76, 2, 1] by randomly selecting
128 samples from the WikiText2 dataset to compute the mean embeddings that inform our rotation
matrix and zigzag permutation order. We also explore the possibility of calibration-free quantization
and show some promising results. However, further investigating more tailored choices for calibration
data can potentially enhance the performance of our quantized models. We leave this for future study.

Broader Impacts.
Our work identifies the presence of massive outliers in down-projection layer of
FFN modules, which significantly complicates low-bit weight-activation quantization. To address this
challenge, we implement a combination of rotation and permutation matrices to effectively smooth
both massive and uniform outliers, proving both fast and effective. Consequently, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for INT4 weight-activation post-training quantization methods. Our approach aims to
accelerate large language models and reduce memory usage during deployment, offering substantial
benefits to the field of LLM research. These advancements could lead to more efficient and accessible
LLM applications, facilitating broader usage and enabling more sustainable AI implementations.

More Visualizations

We provide additional visualizations of normal and massive outliers in various models (LLaMA1,
LLaMA2, Vicuna-v1.5, Mistral) from Figure I1 to Figure I9. In each figure except Mistral, the left
side illustrates changes in normal outliers before and after applying our rotation and permutation
transformations, while the right side shows the changes in massive outliers before and after trans-
formations. It is evident that massive outliers consistently occur in the down-projection layer of the
FFN module across all models, supporting our findings discussed in Section 2. Conversely, normal
outliers appear in different modules within the transformation block. For instance, Figure I3 shows
normal outliers at the up-projection layer of the FFN module in LLaMA1-13B. Significantly, both
massive and normal outliers are reduced markedly after our rotation and permutation transformations,
leading to easier quantization of activations. This underscores the effectiveness of our DuQuant in
managing outlier features across diverse LLM models.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We state the contributions in the abstract and introduction sections.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the main limitations in Appendix H.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

30


---Page Break---
Justification: Please refer to Appendix B for related assumptions and proofs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Implementation details are provided in Appendix C. We have released our
code at https://github.com/Hsu1023/DuQuant.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have released our code at https://github.com/Hsu1023/DuQuant.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Section 4 and Appendix C for experimental settings.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Our study used a fixed seed for all quantization operations, following standards
in post-training quantization, and thus did not report statistical significance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

32


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All experiments are done on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs and A100 GPUs.

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We confirm the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect,
with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the broader impacts of our work in Appendix H.

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

33


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite all datasets and models utilized in our experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

34


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not release new assets.

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
