Abstract

Image pyramids are commonly used in modern computer vision tasks to obtain
multi-scale features for precise understanding of images. However, image pyra-
mids process multiple resolutions of images using the same large-scale model,
which requires signiﬁcant computational cost. To overcome this issue, we pro-
pose a novel network architecture known as the Parameter-Inverted Image Pyra-
mid Networks (PIIP). Our core idea is to use models with different parameter sizes
to process different resolution levels of the image pyramid, thereby balancing com-
putational efﬁciency and performance. Speciﬁcally, the input to PIIP is a set of
multi-scale images, where higher resolution images are processed by smaller net-
works. We further propose a feature interaction mechanism to allow features of
different resolutions to complement each other and effectively integrate informa-
tion from different spatial scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PIIP
achieves superior performance in tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and
image classiﬁcation, compared to traditional image pyramid methods and single-
branch networks, while reducing computational cost. Notably, when applying our
method on a large-scale vision foundation model InternViT-6B, we improve its
performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the
original computation. These results validate the effectiveness of the PIIP approach
and provide a new technical direction for future vision computing tasks.

Introduction

In modern computer vision, high-performance image perception systems increasingly rely on large-
scale pre-trained models. These models typically consume tens of thousands to millions of GPU
hours during pre-training [43, 44, 41]. To adapt these expensively pre-trained models for ﬁne-
grained image perception tasks (e.g., detection [4, 63, 57, 56] and segmentation [19, 50]), researchers
usually combine them with image pyramids [40, 37] or feature pyramids [27, 42, 34]. This combi-
nation is crucial for constructing multi-scale features essential for image understanding.

However, integrating these pre-trained models with image pyramids results in signiﬁcant compu-
tational overhead. Image pyramids process the same image at multiple resolutions with the same
large-scale model, causing the computational demands to increase quadratically with the image res-
olutions across all scales. Although feature pyramids [27, 16, 42] aim to reduce this overhead, in
MS COCO challenges [28], most top-performing models [48, 14, 64, 7] still rely on image pyramids
due to their superior performance. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the computing resources for
building image pyramids while maintaining high performance.

parameter-inverted image pyramid network (PIIP), which pairs models of increasing parameter sizes inversely
with images of decreasing resolution. It delivers better performance than those of (b)(c)(d) with much lower
computational cost.

To address this, our key idea is that it is unnecessary to employ vision models of equivalent size for
feature extraction at all resolutions (Fig. 1(b-c)) or adopt a parameter-direct design (Fig. 1(d)). Fea-
tures at different resolutions can complement each other through adequate feature fusion, thereby
enhancing computational efﬁciency and avoiding redundant modeling of similar information. Specif-
ically, for lower-resolution pyramid levels, the smaller images allow the efﬁcient use of larger mod-
els to extract rich contextual and semantic features. The high-resolution branches need only provide
the detail information missing from the lower-resolution features, instead of re-modeling existing
semantic information. Thus, high-resolution features can focus on smaller receptive ﬁelds with less
semantic information, making it possible to use smaller models to save computational resources.

Building on this strategy, a low-cost and high-performance image pyramid network can be con-
structed using a series of models with increasing parameter size, paired inversely with images of
decreasing resolution, as shown in Fig. 1(e). Each resolution level should be able to directly lever-
age existing pre-trained vision foundation models for feature extraction, avoiding the large compu-
tational costs for training multi-scale image pyramid networks from scratch. In addition, sufﬁcient
feature interactions between different levels are also required to ensure the complementarity of fea-
tures at different scales and avoid redundant feature extractions.

To this end, we propose Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP) based on the comple-
mentarity of image features at different resolutions. Speciﬁcally, the network takes images at mul-
tiple scales as inputs, where higher resolution features are extracted through networks with fewer
parameters for local detail perception, and lower resolution features are extracted with more param-
eters for global information extraction. Additionally, we introduce a feature interaction module that
allows features between different resolutions to complement each other. This structure reduces the
number of parameters of high-resolution branches and effectively integrates information from dif-
ferent receptive ﬁelds, signiﬁcantly reducing computational costs without sacriﬁcing performance.

We conduct experiments on object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation and
image classiﬁcation. Our method achieves better performance while reducing computational costs,
compared to traditional image pyramids and single-branch networks. These results validate the
effectiveness of our multi-resolution feature interaction strategy and parameter-inverted paradigm
and provide a new direction for future visual computing. Our contributions are as follows:

1) We propose a novel architecture named Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid (PIIP) that enhances
the multi-scale representational capability of vision backbones with high computation efﬁciency.
The proposed architecture is capable of effectively and ﬂexibly utilizing strong pre-trained vision
foundation models without the need for extensive training from scratch.

2) We evaluate our method on classic vision tasks of object detection, instance segmentation, seman-
tic segmentation, and image classiﬁcation. Through combination of existing pre-trained models, our
method surpasses single-branch models and other image pyramid methods with higher performance
and lower computation cost.

3) To validate the generalizability of PIIP on large-scale vision foundation models, we apply PIIP to
InternViT-6B [8], improving its performance on object detection and semantic segmentation by 1.9%

We also provide extensive analysis and valuable insights on ablation and design guidelines for PIIP
that may beneﬁt future research.

Related Work

Image Pyramids and Feature Pyramids. Image pyramids and feature pyramids are two widely
used techniques to enhance the multi-scale perceptive ability for downstream dense prediction tasks.
Image pyramids [60, 39, 40, 37] resize the original image and extract features of different resolutions
separately, allowing models to accurately detect objects of various scales. However, this technique
signiﬁcantly increases computational costs. Feature pyramids [27, 16, 42, 61, 34] represent another
method for constructing multi-scale feature representations by merging low-resolution, semantically
strong features with high-resolution, semantically weak features. Although signiﬁcantly reducing
computational costs, they cannot fully replace image pyramids when detecting very small or large
objects [39]. Our proposed architecture integrates both image and feature pyramids and introduces
the parameter-inverted paradigm to achieve efﬁcient computation.

Multi-branch Architectures. Multi-branch architectures have been widely adopted to combine fea-
tures from different resolutions in various computer vision tasks, including image classiﬁcation [5],
object detection [46, 25, 7, 52], semantic segmentation [58, 17] and multimodal dialogues [33, 21].
CrossViT [5] adopts a two-branch structure with different patch sizes to obtain inputs of various
scales and different model sizes to balance the computational load. HRNet series [46, 58, 17] adopt
a four-branch architecture, where the number of branches gradually increases as the layers deepen.
However, they do not adopt the parameter inversion paradigm and cannot utilize existing pre-trained
models. In contrast, we propose a general model architecture that supports the use of pre-trained
models with different parameters to build efﬁcient image pyramids.

Redundancy Reduction for Visual Models. Extensive studies focus on reducing computational re-
dundancy for acceleration. Some work exploits the sparsity of images to accelerate model inference
by reducing the number of visual tokens. Dynamic ViT [38] and AdaViT [35] design lightweight
prediction modules to predict and prune less informative tokens. EViT [26] and Evo-ViT [55] com-
pute attention scores for each token from class token to identify less informative tokens and adopt
accelerated processing strategies for them. Other approaches focus on improving the model struc-
ture for efﬁcient computation, such as attention mechanisms [47, 17, 3] or gradually reducing the
spatial resolution as the number of layers increases [30, 49, 20]. Orthogonal to the above studies, we
propose to use a parameter-inverted design to avoid using large models to process high-resolution
images, greatly reducing the computation redundancy.

Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks

To construct efﬁcient image pyramid networks, we employ a multi-branch structure to handle im-
ages of different resolutions with different sizes of models. As shown in Fig. 2, our architecture con-
sists of three parts: multi-resolution branches, cross-branch interactions, and branch merging. Each
branch uses an off-the-shelf pre-trained model to process images of different resolutions, where
larger resolutions are processed by branches with fewer parameters. Cross-branch interactions are
added every few blocks to fuse features across different feature scales. Branch merging combines
the outputs from all branches to form a ﬁnal output. We use the existing pre-trained ViTs [43, 44, 41]
to initialize the branches, and initialize the interactions and branch merging from scratch.

3.1
Multi-Resolution Branches

The multi-resolution branches serve to extract representations from different image scales and se-
mantic levels. The input image is ﬁrst resized to different resolutions through bilinear interpolation,
and then fed into corresponding branches to extract features at different scales. All the branches have
the same number of blocks N, where each block contains one or multiple ViT [13] layers. Typically,
blocks from different branches have different feature dimensions due to the pre-trained models, e.g.
ViT-T, ViT-S and ViT-B. Branches with larger image sizes have a smaller number of parameters. For
clarity, we refer to the branch with the largest number of parameters (with the smallest image size)
as Branch 1, the second largest as Branch 2, and so on. The output of the i-th block of Branch j is

size, and feature dimension of Branch j, respectively.

3.2
Cross-branch Interactions

Branches of different resolutions focus on different spatial scales and semantic levels. To enhance
the features of different scales, we propose the cross-branch interactions. Each cross-branch interac-
tion consists of several interaction units, where each unit builds connections between outputs from
two feature-scale adjacent branches. The structure of the interaction unit is shown in Fig. 3.

Speciﬁcally, for the outputs of the i-th block of Branch 1 and 2, denoted as Fi
1 ∈RH1W1/P 2
1 ×D1 and
Fi
2 ∈RH2W2/P 2
2 ×D2, we perform two deformable cross-attention [63] between the two features,
denoted as Attention(·). Each cross attention is preceded by a linear layer FC(·) to project the
feature dimension of key and value into that of the query, i.e. from D1 to D2 or vice versa. A feed-
forward network FFN(·) is added after each cross attention to provide channel-wise feature fusion.
The hidden dimension ratio of FFN is set to 0.25 to save computational overhead.

For the ﬁrst cross-attention in the interaction unit, the interaction process can be formulated as:
ˆFi
1 = Fi
1 + γi
1Attention(norm(Fi
1), norm(FC(Fi
2))),
(1)
˜Fi
1 = ˆFi
1 + τ i
1FFN(norm( ˆFi
1)),
(2)

where norm(·) is LayerNorm [1], τ i
1 and γi
1 are learnable parameters, and ˜Fi
1 is the interaction
output. τ i
1 and γi
1 are initialized with 0 to ensure that the feature extraction of the original blocks
(i.e. distribution of Fi
1) will not be modiﬁed drastically due to the interactions, better utilizing the
pre-trained weights.

Similarly, the second cross-attention is performed by switching the query and key/value to obtain ˜Fi
2.
The outputs ˜Fi
1 and ˜Fi
2 are used for subsequent feature extractions. We only construct interaction
units between each pair of feature-scale adjacent branches, such as Branch 1 & Branch 2 and Branch
2 & Branch 3.

3.3
Branch Merging

The ﬁnal feature maps of all branches ˜FN
j
have different spatial shapes and feature dimensions,
where spatially larger feature maps have fewer feature dimensions. A single feature map fails to pro-
vide multi-scale semantic features, so we employ the branch merging module to merge the outputs
of all branches into a single feature map.

As shown in Fig. 2, all branch outputs are ﬁrst projected to the feature dimension of Branch 1
(the largest feature dimension) with Proj(·). Then, all branch outputs are upsampled by bilinear
interpolation Upsample(·) into the feature map size of the last branch (the largest feature map size).

Finally, these outputs, with the same spatial shape and feature dimension, are added together with
learnable scalar weights wj to form the ﬁnal output. This process can be formulated as:

j )),

where M is the number of branches. Fout is the ﬁnal feature map, which has the largest feature
resolution and also the largest feature dimension across all branches.

For object detection and semantic segmentation, Proj(·) is a two-convolution layer with Group-
Norm [51], and the ﬁnal output Fout is used for feature pyramid network [27] similar to ViTDet [23].

For image classiﬁcation, we do not use the branch merging module, but instead append the original
classiﬁcation heads of the pre-trained models after each branch. The ﬁnal classiﬁcation score is the
average of the output logits of all branches. We observe that using the pre-trained heads can speed
up convergence compared to using a randomly initialized head after a branch merging module.

Implementation Details

For comparison with Base-size models, we use pre-trained ViT-T/S/B as the branches to construct
three-branch PIIP network, namely PIIP-TSB. Similarly, ViT-S/B/L are used to construct PIIP-SBL
to match the computation of Large-size models. We also construct four-branch PIIP-TSBL with
ViT-T/S/B/L. We set the number of interactions (each with 2 interaction units as shown in Fig. 2)
N to 12, i.e. after every layer for ViT-T/S/B or after every two layers for ViT-L. We construct
multiple variants of three-branch and four-branch models with different resolution conﬁgurations.
For combinations with an inconsistent number of layers, we will use a larger learning rate decay for
the backbone with fewer layers. For example, for ViT-S/B (12 layers) and ViT-L (24 layers), the
learning rate decay for ViT-S/B is set to be twice that of ViT-L (24/12=2).

For object detection and segmentation, we use ViT-S/B/L pre-trained on ImageNet [11] from DeiT
III [44], ViT-T from DeiT [43]. ViT-H from MAE [18] and InternViT-6B [8] are used for 6B-
scale experiments. For all PIIP-SBL models, we use the ImageNet-21K 384-resolution pre-trained
weights to compare with previous approaches. We adopt AdamW [32] optimizer with layer-wise
learning rate decay [2] to train the model on 8 NVIDIA A800 GPUs. For image classiﬁcation,
in Base-size experiments we use pre-trained ViT-T/S/B weights from DeiT [43]. In Large-size
experiments, since DeiT does not provide ViT-L models, we use ImageNet-21K pre-trained ViT-
S/B/L weights from [41].

We use the FLOPs calculation script from MMDetection [6], with our modiﬁcations to accurately
calculate FLOPs of modules like self-attention and deformable attention. The script is released
along with the training code. We have also manually veriﬁed the calculations using formulas, and
the results are consistent with those produced by the script.

Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

Settings. The MS COCO [28] dataset is used to evaluate the performance on object detection and in-
stance segmentation. We use three detectors, including Mask R-CNN [19], Cascade R-CNN [4] and
DINO [59], based on MMDetection [6]. Following common practices [7], we adopt 1× (12 epochs)
or 3× (36 epochs) training schedules and use window attention [23] to save time and memory. The
total batch size is 16, and the initial learning rate and weight decay are 1e-4 and 0.05.

Effectiveness of Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid. To demonstrate the performance and com-
putational advantages of the Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid (PIIP) Networks, we perform val-
idation on two baseline models ViTDet-B and ViTDet-L [23] in Tab. 1. Taking the three-branch
structure as an example, while maintaining similar performance with ViTDet-B, our PIIP-TSB re-
duces the computational cost by 47.5% (243G vs. 463G) and 38.0% (287G vs. 463G) in object
detection and instance segmentation tasks respectively. Similarly, compared with ViTDet-L, our
PIIP-SBL reduces the computational cost by about 52.9% (727G vs. 1,542G) and 35.0% (1,002G
vs. 1,542G) in the above two tasks respectively. On the other hand, with similar computational
cost as the baseline, PIIP-TSB and PIIP-SBL improve the object detection performance by 2.8%
and 2.6%, respectively, and instance segmentation by 1.5% and 1.2%, compared to ViTDet-B and
ViTDet-L. To better illustrate the above conclusion, we depict the trend between the computational
cost and performance of different PIIP model combinations by adjusting the input resolution, as
shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, when we use the four-branch structures, the curve in the ﬁgure is
slightly better than that of the three-branch structure.

Results with Base-size and Large-size models. As shown in Tab. 2, combined with Mask R-CNN,
PIIP achieves higher performance than ViT-Adapter by a considerable margin, about 0.9% and 1.2%
on APb. With a more powerful detector Cascade R-CNN and stronger training schedule (3× +
MS), PIIP-TSB and PIIP-SBL achieve competitive performance of 53.1% and 54.5% APb, respec-
tively. Finally, we achieve 57.9% APb with the DINO [59] detector. These results demonstrate the
scalability of PIIP.

Results with InternViT-6B. We further examine PIIP on an extremely large vision foundation
model InternViT-6B [8]. As can be seen from Tab. 3, PIIP-LH6B ﬁnally achieves 55.7% APb
when using Mask R-CNN 1× training schedule. In addition, our PIIP can save nearly 43% of the
computation and achieve better performance than the single-branch InternViT-6B by 1.9% on APb
and 0.9% on APm.

Semantic Segmentation

Settings. We use UperNet [54] as the basic framework to train on the ADE20K [62] dataset based
on MMSegmentation [9]. We follow the settings of [30] to train the model for 160k iterations. The
batch size, initial learning rate and weight decay are 16, 4e-5 and 0.05.

Results with Base-size and Large-size models. In Tab. 5, PIIP can achieve better performance
with fewer computations compared with single-branch baselines. In Tab. 4, we compare PIIP with
state-of-the-art segmentation backbones. PIIP-TSB attains 51.6% mIoU with UperNet, exceeding
InternImage-B [48] by 1.4%. Similarly, PIIP-SBL yields 54.3% mIoU, which is outstanding com-
pared to counterparts like ConvNeXt-XL [31] and InternImage-L [48].

Results with InternViT-6B. As shown in Tab. 3, similar to the conclusions obtained in the object
detection experiment, our method achieves better performance than the InternViT-6B baseline with
less computation. PIIP-LH6B ﬁnally achieves 59.65% mIoU without using additional optimization
techniques.

Image Classiﬁcation

Settings. We load the pre-trained models for each branch and train the model for 20 epochs on
ImageNet-1K [11]. The batch size, initial learning rate and weight decay are 1024, 3e-5 and 0.1.
The learning rate for the random initialized interactions is 10 times the base learning rate, i.e. 3e-4.
The other settings mainly follow the ﬁne-tuning recipe of [44] and are provided in the appendix.

Results. As shown in Tab. 6, when compared with the DeiT baseline, our PIIP-SBL reduces the
computational cost by 36.7% (39.0G vs. 61.6G) while maintaining the performance. When using
a similar computational cost as the baseline models, PIIP-TSB and PIIP-SBL improve the top-1
accuracy by 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively.

Ablation Study

Superiority of parameter-inverted image networks. We evaluate the effectiveness of the image
pyramid and parameter-inverted design by comparing our method with other methods, e.g. designs
in Fig. 1. First of all, a single-branch with multi-scale training is the simplest image pyramid practice,
as shown in Tab. 7. Compared with the baseline model, its performance improvement is limited
(44.8% vs. 43.8%). Secondly, we conduct experiments by controlling the scale of the branch model
and the input resolution while ensuring that the total computational cost is close. Speciﬁcally, when
using the same input image resolution, the combination of models of different sizes does not bring

signiﬁcant improvements to detection performance. Correspondingly, when the three branches use
the same model (e.g. BBB), the input image resolution is adjusted to the pyramid structure. The
performance of the ﬁnal model is slightly improved on APb (44.5% vs. 43.8%), but the APm
drops signiﬁcantly (38.7% vs 39.9%) due to the reduction of the maximum resolution. The former
demonstrates the importance of the image pyramid, and the latter further demonstrates the need
for the image pyramid to maintain a larger image scale range, which is especially essential for
instance segmentation. Drawing on experience, parameter-inverted image networks are an efﬁcient
design method that can meet the above requirements, especially when compared to its opposite
conﬁguration parameter-direct image pyramid, i.e. TSB with 448/672/896 resolution (46.6% vs.
42.6%). As shown in Tab. 7, with less computation than the baseline, the model can support image
inputs in the maximum range from 672 to 1,568, and the performance is signiﬁcantly improved.

Design guidelines for parameter-inverted image networks. Through extensive practice, there
are two empirical design guidelines when scaling up the model: 1) Prioritize increasing the image
resolution of the largest image branch: as shown in the blue dashed circle in Fig. 5(a), the input
resolution of the largest image branch is greatly increased without causing a sharp increase in the
total computational cost. 2) The largest model does not need to exceed the compared baseline model:
the introduction of larger models will limit the resolution range of the image pyramid, e.g. TSB is
more cost-effective than TBL according to Fig. 5(a).

Branch merging. Experiments in Tab. 8 prove that branch merging of all branches yields the best
performance by providing multi-scale semantically rich features, compared to only using feature
maps from single or partial branches.

Attention type. The core of information interaction between branches is cross-attention. We adopt
PIIP-TSB with resolution 1120/896/448 as the basic model and investigate two different attention
mechanisms. As shown in Tab. 9, deformable attention [53] with linear complexity can signiﬁcantly
improve the performance of the model without substantially increasing the computational cost. We
end up using deformable attention as the default conﬁguration. Notably, it can be replaced by other
more advanced attention mechanisms in the future to further boost performance.

Figure 6: Performance of different interaction directions.

Number of interactions. As shown in Tab. 9, no matter which attention mechanism is used, the
increase in the number of interactions will improve the performance of the model to varying degrees.
Since it also increases the computational cost, we further explore the cost-effectiveness of different
numbers of interactions. We conduct experiments with different resolution combinations on models
with different numbers of interactions, and the scatter plot of all results is shown in Fig. 5(b). It
can be seen that when the number of interactions is small (less than 2), the growth trend of model
performance with the increase in computational cost is relatively slow. We attribute this to too few
interactions and insufﬁcient information complementation between branches. Therefore, we use 12
interactions by default. Note that as the model size increases (e.g. more layers), the number of
interactions can also increase accordingly.
Interaction direction between branches.
We compare ﬁve different interaction directions in
Tab. 10. Considering both the computational cost and performance, we ﬁnally choose the fourth
method, i.e. bidirectional connections of adjacent branches, as the default choice. As can be seen
from Fig. 6, all the interaction directions achieve a satisfactory performance-computation balance,
validating their ability to improve communication between branches.

Conclusion

This paper introduces the Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP) to address the com-
putational challenges of traditional image pyramids. With the parameter-inverted design and fea-
ture interaction mechanism, PIIP effectively balances computational efﬁciency and performance.
Extensive experiments on detection, segmentation and classiﬁcation tasks demonstrate that PIIP
outperforms traditional methods and single-branch networks while reducing computational costs,
providing an efﬁcient and effective framework of multi-scale feature integration for future research.

Limitations. While our method manages to save computation, its memory consumption is higher
than single-branch models due to the increase of parameter count. Our current method only focuses
on ViT-based models. PIIP with hierarchical networks (e.g. CNN) or heterogeneous structures (e.g.
CNN for some branches and ViT for other branches) remain unexplored for future work.

Preliminary Attempt on From-scratch Pre-training

As an initial effort to extend our parameter-inverted image pyramid design to from-scratch pre-
training, we design a model PIIP-B and evaluate it on ImageNet-1K [11] dataset. The speciﬁc con-
ﬁguration of PIIP-B is provided in Table 13(a), which is based on the principle that all the branches
should have similar computational costs, i.e. the number of parameters is inversely proportional
to the square of the resolution, while keeping the total number of parameters and FLOPs similar
to ViT-B. Contrary to the experiments in Section 4.4 where the classiﬁcation heads of the origi-
nal pre-trained models are used, we use a branch merging module and append a linear layer with
GroupNorm for Proj(.), followed by a ﬁnal LayerNorm and a linear classiﬁcation head.

We follow the pre-training recipe of [44] and change the number of epochs to 300. The result is
provided in Table 13(b), where we observe that our three-branch model surpasses the baseline by
0.7%, demonstrating the potential of PIIP in pre-training.

A.4
Broader Impacts

Our method helps to save computational overheads of large-scale vision foundation models such as
InternViT-6B, therefore reducing energy consumption. This may bring positive impacts on carbon
emissions reduction and contribute to environmental sustainability. However, energy consumption
of large models still needs to be treated with caution.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The contributions are stated in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these
goals are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The limitations are discussed in the conclusion section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means
that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The au-
thors should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what
the implications would be.
• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the ap-
proach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to ad-
dress problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justiﬁcation: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo-
rems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a
short proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple-
mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu-
sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: The details are provided in the experiment section and the appendix. Our
code has been released.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps
taken to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture
fully might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation,
it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with
the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data
is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via
detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in
the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means
that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all sub-
missions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear
how to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to re-
produce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to
construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case au-
thors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The data is publicly available datasets. Our code has been released. Details
to reproduce the experiments is described in the experiments section and the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so No is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Training details are in the experiment section and appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of
detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropri-
ate information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justiﬁcation: Calculating error bars would be too computational expensive, given the size
of the model and the dataset.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁ-
dence intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

19


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer-
ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of
Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Details are in the experiment section and the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments
that didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: the paper conforms the code of ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Broader impacts are discussed in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact spe-
ciﬁc groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitiga-
tion strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justiﬁcation: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by re-
quiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or
implementing safety ﬁlters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justiﬁcation: Datasets are referenced. License are provided in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the li-
cense of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: Documentation is be provided along with the code and models.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can
either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the pa-
per include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable,
as well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should
be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, cura-
tion, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the
data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equiva-
lent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval,
you should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary signiﬁcantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity
(if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
