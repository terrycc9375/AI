Abstract

This work presents BAdam, an optimization method that leverages the block coordi-
nate descent (BCD) framework with Adam’s update rule. BAdam offers a memory
efficient approach to the full parameter finetuning of large language models. We
conduct a theoretical convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case.
Experimentally, we apply BAdam to finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B
models using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU and 4×A100-80GB GPUs, respec-
tively. The results confirm BAdam’s efficiency in terms of memory usage, running
time, and optimization capability. Furthermore, the downstream performance
evaluation based on MT-bench and math benchmarks shows that BAdam outper-
forms existing memory efficient baselines such as LoRA. It also demonstrates that
BAdam can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to Adam.
Finally, the ablation study using SGD’s update rule illustrates the suitability of BCD
for finetuning LLMs. Our code can be easily integrated into any PyTorch-based
codebase and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/BAdam.

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 [1] and Llama 3 [15] have shown its strong ability
in language understanding, generation, reasoning, translation, etc [5, 73, 72, 60]. Due to its strong
applicability, LLMs have been regarded as a feasible approach towards artificial general intelligence
[6]. Finetuning or adaptation has become an important step in applying pretrained LLMs to follow
human instructions or perform specific downstream tasks [44, 63].

Backgrounds. When GPU memory (RAM) is not a major limitation, full parameter finetuning
methods—such as applying Adam to the entire set of parameters of LLMs—often offer the most
flexibility for parameter search. However, executing such a full parameter training method typically
requires a significant amount of GPU memory. For instance, to finetune an LLM with M billion
parameters, Adam [23] necessitates roughly 18M GB of GPU memory for successful training, and
this estimate does not even account for the storage of activations used in the backpropagation (BP)
process; see Section 2.2.1 for a detailed analysis. This requirement poses challenges for computational
resources as models scale up, given the fact that GPU memory is often limited in practical settings.

Parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [22], Adapter
[21], prompt- and prefix-tuning [29, 26], among others, play a critical role in finetuning large language
models under memory resource constraints. The principal idea of PEFT is to represent the parameter
updates in a much lower-dimensional subspace and, consequently, the memory consumption is
significantly reduced. Despite the success of PEFT methods, finetuning within a substantially
lower-dimensional subspace may potentially limit downstream performance; see, e.g., [62].

Table 1: Algorithm feature summary. Here, M represents that the model to be trained has M billion
number of parameters, r is the LoRA rank, m is the weight matrix dimension (here, we consider
square weight matrices for simplicity), D is the number of transformer layers in LOMO or the number
of partitioned blocks in BAdam. BAdam performs full parameter mixed precision update, while only
requires memory that is comparable to LOMO and LoRA.

The observations outlined above motivate us to explore a memory efficient full parameter optimization
method without imposing low-rank constraint on the parameter update.

Main results. In this work, we have the following main contributions:

(C.1) We propose a block coordinate descent (BCD)-type optimization method with Adam’s update
rule, termed BAdam; see Section 2.1 for the detailed description. This method partitions the
entire set of model parameters into D blocks, updating one block at a time using Adam’s
efficient update steps. BAdam offers a memory efficient solution to the full parameter
finetuning of LLMs. For example, by partitioning a model with M billion parameters into
D equal-sized blocks, BAdam requires only about 2M + 16M

D
GB of GPU memory for
successful mixed precision training; see Section 2.2.1 for detailed analysis. This leads to
a significant reduction in memory demands compared to full parameter finetuning using
Adam. Theoretically, we provide a convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic
case, demonstrating that leveraging the BCD framework and Adam’s update rule yields a
convergent scheme; see Theorem 2.1.
(C.2) We apply BAdam to finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models using a single
RTX3090-24GB GPU and 4×A100-80GB GPUs, respectively. Specifically, we present
in Section 3.1 BAdam’s efficiency in both memory consumption and running time. In
Section 3.2, we empirically verify BAdam’s optimization capability via its fast convergence
and the high rankness of its learned perturbations. We further evaluate the downstream
performance of different methods using MT-bench and several math benchmarks; see Sec-
tion 3.3. The results illustrate that BAdam generally outperforms existing memory efficient
baselines such as LoRA. Importantly, BAdam achieves comparable average performance
with Adam on math benchmarks and even surpasses Adam in instruction-following tasks
evaluated by MT-bench score. Moreover, we conduct ablation study using SGD’s update rule
(BSGD) in Section 3.4. The results show that BCD variants maintain optimization capability
compared to their full counterparts and even exhibit better downstream performance. It
also demonstrates that BSGD can achieve similar downstream performance to BAdam,
illustrating the effectiveness and suitability of BCD for finetuning LLMs.

We compare BAdam with several representative methods in Table 1. In summary, we believe that
BAdam may serve as a viable alternative optimization method to state-of-the-art methods such as
LoRA in scenarios with limited computing memory.

The BAdam Method

Block coordinate descent (BCD) method has a long history in optimization society, which can be
traced back to the very origins of the discipline; see, e.g., [43, 36, 4, 55, 41, 58]. At each iteration,
BCD maintains the majority of the optimization parameters at their up-to-date iteration values, while
it approximately optimizes the objective function over the remaining parameters, resulting in a much
lower dimensional problem.

BCD is known to be efficient for huge-scale problems where the number of optimization parameters
is extensive [41], particularly when it significantly exceeds the number of data points / component

functions. Based on this main feature, we reveal an interesting link between BCD and the finetuning
of LLMs. Namely, the finetuning process boils down to an optimization problem that needs to handle
a huge number of trainable model parameters, while the number of training data points are relatively
small. This setting matches exactly the advantage of the BCD scheme, providing the possibility
to release the requirement on large GPU memory. We refer to Sections 3.2 and 3.4 for empirical
verification on the power and suitability of BCD for finetuning LLMs.

2.1
Algorithm Description and Convergence Result

In this subsection, we propose BAdam, a block coordinate descent method embedded with Adam’s
update rule. The method is displayed in Algorithm 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Formally, let us
consider an abstract formulation for finetuning LLMs minθ L(θ) = 1

n
Pn
j=1 ℓj(θ). Here, θ ∈Rd

represents the concatenation of the vectorized parameters of the model, n is the number of training
data points, and ℓj is the negative log-likelihood loss function for language modeling on the j-th
training data point.

Block partition and block coordinate descent framework. At the t-th block-epoch, BAdam
first generates an ordered block partition π = {π1, . . . , πi, . . . , πD}, which splits the whole model
parameters θ ∈Rd into D blocks, i.e., θ = {θπ1, . . . , θπi, . . . , θπD} with θπi ∈Rdi and PD
j=1 dj =
d. The partition π can be very flexible and is a unified representation. Given a large language model,
one natural block partition is by transformer modules. Apart from this partition, one can also choose
a small part of parameters from each transformer module and regard these parameters as one block
θπi. Note that π may be either a deterministic or a random partition, as long as the aggregation of all
the blocks {θπi} forms the whole set of parameters θ. For instance, if we partition by consecutive
transformer modules, we may list the blocks in π in ascending order (e.g., from the input to the output
module), descending order (e.g., from the output to the input module), or random reshuffling order.

We now present the optimization framework of BAdam. Our core idea is to adopt the main spirit of
BCD. Namely, we approximately optimize over only one active block θπi at one time, given that the
other inactive blocks are fixed at their up-to-date values. Mathematically, at the t-th block-epoch,
updating the current active block θπi amounts to solving the following subproblem:

θt+1

πD).
(1)

When this approximate minimization becomes exact, this scheme is also known as Gauss-Seidel
method or alternating minimization. Even with exact minimization, some literature still refers to it as
BCD. One can see that subproblem (1) fixes the inactive blocks at their most recent values, and hence

We choose the algorithmic procedure A in (2) to be K Adam steps [23] starting at θt
πi, in order to
efficiently decrease the objective function. To specify the concrete Adam steps, we first note that the
gradient of the objective function can be correspondingly decomposed as

(3)

We call
∂L
∂θπi in (3) the block gradient of the objective function L over block θπi. According to the
main spirit of stochastic optimization methods, we select a batch of data points to compute a block
stochastic gradient gπi using the up-to-date iterates for approximating the block gradient, as outlined
in Line 9 of Algorithm 1. With gπi, we construct the momentum and second moment for the active
block θπi as shown in Line 10 – Line 11. Finally, we implement Adam update in Line 12. One may
also invoke decoupled weight decay [34] into Line 12. In summary, Line 6 – Line 15 concretely
implement the BCD update (1).

It is important to note that BAdam differs from existing BCD with momentum approaches [41], which
often maintain dense momentum vectors. BAdam is specifically designed for memory efficiency, and
hence it clears the optimizer states in Line 15. Additionally, we do not offload the optimizer states,
as they will no longer correspond to the updated block parameters in the next block-epoch. Thus,
clearing the states in Line 15 and starting with zero initial states for every new active block in Line 6
are crucial for ensuring convergence, stability, and memory efficiency of our method.

The number K in Line 7 of Algorithm 1 is the only additional hyperparameter introduced by BAdam,
compared to Adam. We provide a detailed discussion on selecting K in Appendix B.2.

Convergence result. We provide a convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case, aiming
to establish that combining the block coordinate descent framework with Adam’s update rule results

---Page Break---
in a convergent scheme. We consider the extension to the stochastic case as future work. Indeed,
combining the analysis for Adam with stochastic gradients, as in [65, 27, 57], with our analysis for
the block coordinate descent framework could be a feasible direction for such an extension. The
informal theorem is presented below, while the formal theorem and proofs are put in Appendix D.

Theorem 2.1 (informal). BAdam using deterministic gradients is a descent method, under certain
commonly utilized conditions for analyzing block coordinate descent method and Adam. That is, after
one block-epoch of updates for the whole model, we have

L(θt+1) −L(θt) ≤−O(αK)∥∇L(θt)∥2.
(4)

Consequently, BAdam finds a δ-approximate stationary point within O(δ−2) iterations.

We conclude this section by noting that BAdam is essentially a block coordinate descent method, in
which the BCD framework achieves low memory consumption. Apart from the chosen Adam’s update
rule, it is possible to propose other efficient optimization procedures for concretely implementing (1);
see Section 3.4 for an ablation study where we also employ SGD’s update rule.

2.2
Analysis of Memory Consumption and BP Time

2.2.1
Memory Consumption Analysis

We analyze the memory consumption of BAdam, caused by storing the model parameters, gradient,
and optimizer states. Let us consider a large language model with M billion parameters. We will use
GB as the unit of GPU memory in the sequel.

We first analyze the memory cost of Adam with mixed precision training. One needs to store the
FP16 model parameters for the BP process, which costs 2M memory. For a more precise update, the
optimizer also maintains a master copy of a FP32 model, which costs 4M memory. Then, it comes to
store the gradient (converted to FP32), momentum, and second moment in FP32 precision, costing
4M + 4M + 4M = 12M memory. In total, Adam needs roughly 18M memory.

In terms of BAdam, it needs to store the up-to-date model parameters (see Figure 1) in FP16 precision,
which costs 2M memory. Importantly, since BAdam only updates the active block at one time, we
can store the model parameters, gradient, momentum, and second moment only for the active block
θπi in FP32 precision, where the FP32 model parameters and gradient of the active block can be
obtained by transforming their FP16 versions to the FP32 versions. Let us consider the simple case
where the partitioned D blocks are equal-sized. Then, BAdam only needs in total

2M + 16M

D
memory.
(5)

Note that the above analyses do not account for the memory required to store activations, as this is
associated with the BP process rather than the optimization method itself. Furthermore, gradient
checkpointing [11] can be employed to reduce the memory requirement needed for storing activations.
We display the actual memory consumption for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model in Section 3.1.

2.2.2
BP Time Analysis for Consecutive Module-based Block Partition

We consider the specific case where the partitioned D blocks {θπi} are D consecutive transformer
modules of LLMs. Thanks to the property of backpropagation, BAdam can reduce the computation
time of BP compared to Adam and LoRA under the same amount of data utilization.

Let us consider one block-epoch of BAdam, meaning that it has trained with K · D data batches,
where K is defined in Algorithm 1. We consider that each data point has the same sequence length
and each transformer module has the same amount of parameters, in order to ease the analysis. Recall
that a BP process consists of a forward pass and a backward pass. For the forward pass, BAdam has
almost the same computational load as that of Adam, while LoRA requires more forward computation
due to its extra low-rank adapters. Hence, it remains to consider the number of unit-backward-pass
after utilizing KD data batches, where the unit-backward-pass is defined as a backward pass of
a single data batch through a single transformer module. Importantly, BAdam only updates the
active block, and hence the number of unit-backward-pass largely depends on the depth of the active
block. For instance, if the input module or output module is the current active block, we need D

5


---Page Break---
unit-backward-pass or only 1 unit-backward-pass, respectively. Thus, after one block-epoch (i.e.,
utilizing KD data batches), BAdam requires

K(1 + · · · + D) = KD(D + 1)

2
unit-backward-pass.
(6)

However, Adam and LoRA need to backward for all the D transformer modules, thus requiring KD2
unit-backward-pass after utilizing KD data batches.

Apart from saving the number of unit-backward-pass, some of the unit-backward-pass of BAdam
may even take less computational time compared to that of Adam. Let us take the backward pass of
the input module as an example. BAdam does not require explicit stochastic gradient computation
of the model parameters of the intermediate modules ∂zl/∂θl, where {zl} are the activations of the
intermediate modules and {θl} are the trainable model parameters of these modules. However, Adam
needs to compute these quantity explicitly. We refer to Table 4 for an experiment illustration.

In summary, BAdam with consecutive module-based block partition saves computational load of
the BP process compared to Adam and LoRA, after training with the same amount of data. We
demonstrate this through experiments detailed in Section 3.1. If the module-based block partition is
not consecutive, for instance, when one block consists of modules (such as matrices) from different
transformer layers, we still expect that BAdam can reduce BP time to some extent, though not as
significantly as indicated by (6).

Experiment Results

In this section, we evaluate the proposed BAdam on finetuning LLMs. Selected baselines include
LOMO (essentially SGD) [37], LoRA [22], Galore [66], and Adam [23]. All BAdam experiments
for training the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models are conducted on a single RTX3090-24GB GPU,
whereas BAdam experiments for the Llama 3-70B model use 4×A100-80GB GPUs. Experiments
for the baseline methods are conducted using either a single RTX3090 or multiple A100 GPUs,
depending on their memory requirements. Our implementation is based on Llama-Factory [69].
Detailed experiment setup can be found in Appendix B.1.

3.1
Memory Consumption and Wall-clock Running Time

In this subsection, we present the empirically measured memory consumption and wall-clock running
time of BAdam and baseline methods. All the measurements in this subsection are based on finetuning
the Llama 3-8B model on Alpaca-GPT4 dataset [46] using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU.

Memory consumption. We report the actual memory consumption of BAdam and the baseline
approaches in Table 2 for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model, in which the memory consumption of
Adam is estimated rather than tested. This result indicates that all of LOMO, LoRA (with a reasonable
rank), and BAdam can finetune the Llama 3-8B model using a single RTX3090. It can be observed
that all the methods have nearly the same memory cost for storing the model parameters, while
LoRA requires slightly more memory due to its low-rank adapters. Furthermore, LOMO, LoRA,
and BAdam significantly reduce memory consumption regarding the storage of the gradient and
optimizer states compared to Adam. Moreover, it is easy to see that the total memory consumption
(the last column of Table 2) is higher than the sum of the listed quantities. The additional memory
costs arise from storing activations and training data, pre-allocated memory caches by PyTorch, and
other buffers for intermediate computing results. Indeed, our tests show that BAdam can successfully
finetune the Llama 3-8B model with input sequences of length 1024 using a batch size of 2, or input
sequences of length 2048 using a batch size of 1, with a single RTX3090-24GB GPU.

Wall-clock running time comparison. We conduct experiments on finetuning the Llama 3-8B
model for 3 epochs with each method and report the averaged wall-clock time per epoch; see Table 3.
The forward time for three approaches are rather close. The slightly higher time cost for LOMO
and LoRA attributes to additional operations for registering activations and the calculation of the
low-rank adapters, respectively. Regarding backward time, BAdam reduces the time cost by nearly
half compared to LoRA and LOMO, supporting the analysis in Section 2.2.2. It is important to note
that the backward time for all methods includes the re-forward time due to gradient checkpointing,
which diminishes the running time advantage of BAdam.

In Table 4, we conduct tailored experiments to further support our analysis in Section 2.2.2. It can
be observed that: 1) backward for "Output module only" is almost time free, as it requires only
1 unit-backward-pass; 2) backward for "All modules" takes significantly more time, as it has to
implement D unit-backward-pass; and 3) backward for "Input module only" takes less time than D
unit-backward-pass (i.e., backward for "All modules"), since the former scheme does not need to
compute the stochastic gradients of the intermediate modules’ parameters.

We verify the optimization capability of BAdam through both the training loss convergence and the
effective rank of the learned perturbations. Experiments in this subsection correspond to exactly the
same training process of the lower block of Table 5 for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model.

Loss convergence. In the left figure of Figure 2, we display the online training loss. From a pure
optimization perspective, namely, in terms of driving the training loss lower, BAdam demonstrates
better convergence behavior than LoRA when using 1e-5 as the initial learning rate. If the initial
learning rate is set to 1e-6, BAdam initially converges slightly faster, but the two methods soon align
as the learning rate becomes too small to make substantial progress.

Effective rank of the learned perturbations. We empirically measure the learning and optimization
capability of BAdam through the effective rank of its learned perturbations, i.e., the difference
between the learned weight matrix and the pretrained base weight matrix ∆W := WK −W0. The

cumulative explained variance "cvar" and the effective rank of matrix A ∈Rm×n are defined as:

cvar(r) :=
Pr
i=1 σi(A)2
Pmin{m,n}
j=1
σj(A)2 ,
effective_rank(A) := min {r : cvar(r) ≥0.9} ,

where σi(A) is the i-th largest singular value of A.

In the middle figure of Figure 2, we display cvar of BAdam’s update for the 25th layer’s up-proj
matrix. This result shows that BAdam’s update has a heavy tailed singular values distribution and
is far away from a low-rank update. In the right figure of Figure 2, we plot the effective rank of
the learned perturbation by BAdam and Adam through all modules of different transformer layers.
Notably, BAdam achieves almost the same high rank update as Adam, which partly justifies BAdam’s
learning and optimization capability.

Downstream Performance Evaluation

In this subsection, we conduct supervised finetuning for the Llama 2-7B [54], Llama 3-8B, and Llama
3-70B models on the Alpaca-GPT4 and MathInstruct [61] datasets. The setting of hyperparameters is
deferred to Appendix B.2.

MT-bench results. To illustrate the models’ downstream performance, we report the MT-bench
scores of the instruction-tuned models obtained by different methods for 3 epochs. We utilize two
initial learning rates, 1e-5 and 1e-6, with a cosine scheduler for all methods. The results are displayed
in Table 5.

Table 5: MT-bench scores of the instruction-tuned Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B on Alpaca-GPT4
dataset by different methods.
(a)Adam with learning rate 1e-5 for finetuning Llama 3-8B overfits the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset and achieves
MT-bench scores that are even lower than that of the base model. Hence, we omit this outlier.

Some remarks and observations on Table 5 are in order. 1) Using 1e-5 as the initial learning rate, the
average MT-bench score over 3 epochs achieved by BAdam surpasses that of LoRA by a magnitude
of 0.42 for instruction-tuning the Llama 2-7B model. Regarding instruction-tuning the Llama 3-8B
model using an initial learning rate of 1e-6, the average score returned by BAdam outperforms that
of LoRA by a magnitude of 0.38. 2) In most cases, BAdam can beat LoRA and Galore, albeit
sometimes slightly, across the two learning rate settings and when evaluating checkpoints from
different epochs for both the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models. This underscores the promising
performance of our proposed method. 3) BAdam is on par with the performance of Adam for the
Llama 2-7B model and outperforms Adam for the Llama 3-8B model, partly illustrating the power of
the BCD optimization scheme in LLM finetuning. It is worth noting that BAdam is both memory
and running time efficient. In terms of memory usage, it requires only a single RTX3090-24GB GPU
for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model, while Adam needs multiple A100-80GB GPUs.

Math benchmarks. We also finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models on the MathInstruct
dataset for 3 epochs, and evaluate the trained model using math benchmarks across different domains.
The results are shown in Table 6. In terms of average score, BAdam outperforms all the memory
efficient baselines, and even slightly surpasses the benchmark score of Adam while requiring signifi-
cantly less memory consumption compared to Adam. In particular, for the experiments on finetuning
Llama 3-8B, BAdam outperforms LoRA in 4 out of 6 tasks, and surpasses LOMO and Galore in all
the tasks by a large margin. For finetuning Llama 3-70B, BAdam beats LoRA in 5 out of 6 tasks.

Figure 3: Ablation study for BCD variants and their full counterparts for finetuning Llama 3-8B on
Alpaca-GPT4 dataset. Left and middle: Convergence behavior. Right: MT-bench scores.

In this subsection, we conduct ablation study to consider SGD’s update rule in our BCD framework,
leading to BCD with SGD (BSGD). Then, we compare the performance of BAdam, BSGD and their
full counterparts, i.e., Adam and SGD, to illustrate the power of BCD in LLMs finetuing.

Optimization. In the left and middle figures of Figure 3, we display the training loss of BAdam,
BSGD, and their full counterparts. It can be observed that BCD variants converge slightly slower but
soon exhibit similar convergence behavior in terms of running time compared to their full counterparts.
It is worth mentioning that, unlike the full counterparts, BCD only updates one block of parameters
per data batch, demonstrating the strong optimization ability of BCD for LLMs finetuning.

Downstream performance. In the right table of Figure 3, we test the MT-bench scores of the four
methods. It is quite interesting to see that BSGD significantly outperforms SGD (almost as good as
BAdam), even though they have almost the same optimization convergence behavior. We suspect that
the superiority of the BCD variants over their full counterparts possibly stems from the fact that BCD
uses each data batch to update only one block of parameters, thereby better preserving the general
knowledge of the pretrained model during finetuning. These improved downstream performance of
BCD compared to their full counterparts further illustrate its suitability for LLM finetuning.

Additional Experiment Results

We provide more experiment results in Appendix C. Here are the summarized results: 1) In Ap-
pendix C.1, we conduct an ablation study on the ordering scheme of the partition π in BAdam,
considering random reshuffling, ascending, and descending orders. In terms of convergence behavior,
these three choices are competitive. We also provide an ablation study on the hyperparameter K in
BAdam, with K being chosen from {10, 50, 100, 200}. The results indicate that these four choices
of K perform similarly in terms of convergence behavior. However, we observe that the convergence
speed of choosing different K can vary across different models. We refer to Appendix B.2 for a
detailed discussion on the selection of K. 2) In Appendix C.2, we examine BAdam’s capability in
classification tasks by training RoBERTa-large on SuperGLUE benchmarks. The results show that
BAdam can achieve similar average scores as Adam. 3) In Appendix C.3, we conduct a preliminary
continue pretraining (CPT) experiment. We apply BAdam to train the Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model
on the StarCoder-Python dataset [28] for about 1 epoch. The result shows that BAdam can effectively
decrease the CPT loss, making it a strong candidate for CPT tasks when GPU memory is limited. 4)
We display the memory consumption and running time costs for finetuning the Llama 2-7B model in
Appendix C.4, which match the results for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model presented in Section 3.1.

In summary, our experiment results in Section 3 demonstrate that BAdam has the potential to serve as
a competitive optimization method for finetuning LLMs when the GPU memory is limited, compared
to state-of-the-art memory efficient methods such as LoRA.

Brief Literature Review

We briefly review several memory efficient finetuning methods in this section. A more comprehensive
literature review is presented in Appendix A due to limited space.

One major branch for memory efficient finetuning of LLMs is parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT),
which freezes the pre-trained weight and only trains the additional injected parameters. LoRA [22],
adapter [21], and prefix-tuning [29] belong to this class and have been verified to be effective
in finetuning LLMs. Another line of works focus on memory efficient full parameter finetuning.
MeZO [38] performs zero-th order SGD update without calculating the stochastic gradient, thereby
only requires the memory of performing inference. LOMO [37] efficiently performs on-the-fly
SGD update during the backward pass without storing the stochastic gradient. However, LOMO’s
implementation design prevents it from using gradient accumulation technique. Galore [66] reduces
memory consumption by projecting the gradient into low-rank space. It requires constantly performing
SVD to obtain the low-rank projector.

Conclusion and Discussions on Limitations

In this work, we have proposed the BAdam optimization method, which is built upon the block
coordinate descent framework with Adam’s update rule. We finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B
models on the Alpaca-GPT4 and MathInstruct datasets by BAdam with a single RTX3090-24GB GPU
and 4×A100-80GB GPUs, respectively. The results illustrated the efficacy of BAdam in terms of GPU
memory consumption and running time. Empirically, BAdam exhibits better convergence behavior
compared to LoRA and learns high rank update. Further downstream performance assessments
have demonstrated BAdam’s superior performance in instruction finetuning and math finetuning,
in comparison to LOMO, LoRA, and Galore. Additionally, BAdam has on par or even better
downstream performance compared to Adam. In summary, we believe that BAdam may serve as a
viable alternative for finetuning LLMs with limited memory resources.

Limitations. Our focus has been on applying BAdam for supervised finetuning. Extending its
application to preference optimization represents another opportunity to demonstrate BAdam’s
capabilities. Moreover, our CPT experiment using BAdam is only preliminary. Exploring extensively
BAdam’s performance in the CPT setting is an interesting direction. We leave these directions for
future improvements.

Broader impacts. Our proposed method significantly lowers the barrier to full parameter finetuning
of large models for a broader range of researchers. This is a technical algorithmic contribution that
does not yield explicit negative societal impacts. However, it carries a risk of misuse.

We present a review of the relevant literature below. Given the extensive and rapidly growing body of
work in this field, it is important to note that the references we include here are not exhaustive.

Block coordinate descent method. The block coordinate descent (BCD) method is a well-established
algorithmic scheme in the field of optimization [43, 36, 4, 55, 41, 58], which is especially efficient
for problems with an exceptionally large number of trainable parameters. Some advanced analyses
on its convergence in both convex and nonconvex cases can be found in, e.g., [50, 35, 42, 67, 7, 8]
and the references therein. The works [52, 16, 51, 10, 39] also theoretically discuss the effects of
different choices of the block update order in BCD and ADMM-BCD variants, which is related to the
ordering scheme in the partition π of BAdam. BCD has been widely and practically applied in the
machine learning area as well. For instance, a specific instance of BCD, known as layer-wise training,
has been utilized for neural network training [20, 3, 2, 71, 45]. The sequential minimal optimization
technique integrated into LIBSVM [9] is also a BCD-type method.

Parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT). An effective strategy for finetuning LLMs is to train a
small number of (possibly extra) model parameters, while keeping the majority of the pretrained
parameters frozen. Numerous approaches have been proposed and studied along this line of research.
For instance, adapter tuning only finetunes the inserted small modules between layers called adapters
[21]. Prompt-tuning / prefix-tuning [26, 29] attaches additional trainable prefix tokens to the input
and/or hidden layers, while remaining the base model unchanged. Another prevalent method is the
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [22], which models the increment to the base model as a product of
two significantly lower dimensional trainable low-rank matrices. Subsequent research on LoRA has
aimed at extending its rank constraints [30, 59], further reducing the number of trainable parameters
[24, 25], decreasing memory usage through quantization [14], etc. Presently, LoRA-type methods
are commonly employed for finetuning LLMs with limited memory resources. Interested readers are
referred to [17] for a unified framework and comprehensive comparison of these PEFT methods.

Memory efficient full parameter finetuning. To conduct full parameter finetuning of LLMs with
limited memory, the work [37] proposes LOMO, which efficiently leverages the BP process to update
parameters on the fly in the process of computing stochastic gradients. Consequently, LOMO helps
to execute SGD for full parameter finetuning without physically storing the stochastic gradients,
significantly reducing memory consumption. However, it is worth emphasizing that SGD generally
converges more slowly and is often considered suboptimal compared to Adam. MeZO [38] is to
approximate SGD by using only the forward pass. The idea of MeZO derives from zeroth-order
optimization, which utilizes function value difference to approximate the stochastic gradients of the
trainable model parameters. Galore [66] uses gradient low-rank projection, which largely reduces
memory consumption for full parameter finetuning compared to Adam. Adam-mini [64] proposes
to apply block-wise adaptive learning rate, which reduces the memory for storing the full second
moment. Another popular approach for finetuning with limited memory is to perform CPU offloads
to reduce the memory consumption caused by training data and optimizers; see, e.g., [49, 48, 33].

Detailed Experiment Setup and Hyperparameters

B.1
Experiment Setup

In this subsection, we introduce the setup including the dataset, evaluation, and training details. We
present the hyperparameters in Appendix B.2.

Task setup. Our experiments mainly consist of instruction tuining, math finetuning, and natural
language understanding.

1. Instruction tuning. We finetune the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models on Alpaca-
GPT4 dataset [46] for 3 epochs. This dataset consists of 52k instruction-following data
generated by GPT-4, using prompts from the Alpaca dataset [53]. The finetuned model
is then evaluated using the MT-bench [68] with the "gpt-4" API to test its downstream
performance.
2. Math finetuning. We finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models on MathInstruct
dataset [61] for 3 epochs, which contains 260K samples from 13 math related datasets. The
model is then evaluated on 4 in-domain benchmarks [12, 19, 31, 40] and 2 out-of-domain
benchmarks [70, 18] using zero-shot prompt. Our evaluation implementation is based on
the released code2 of [61].
3. SuperGLUE. we finetune the RoBERTa-large model [32] with 355 million parameters on
the SuperGLUE benchmark [56], and evaluate the performance of the finetuned model using
the test dataset. Since the label of the original test dataset is not revealed, we randomly
split the "dev" dataset into validation and test dataset; see Table 7. We focus on 6 tasks
of the SuperGLUE benchmark, including BoolQ, COPA, WSC, RTE, MultiRC, and WiC.
Since the classification modules of RoBERTa-large are randomly initialized, we set these
classification modules to be trainable for all methods.

Table 7: Data split for the SuperGLUE experiment. The original "dev" dataset is randomly splitted
into validation and test datasets.

Setup for different finetuning methods. For BAdam, we use consecutive module-based block
partition represented by transformer layers, resulting in the number of blocks D = 32 for the
Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models, D = 80 for the Llama 3-70B model, and D = 26 for the
RoBERTa-large model. The ordering strategy in the partition π of BAdam is random reshuffling. For
Galore, LoRA, and BAdam, we train all the transformer layers while freezing the language modeling
head and the embedding layers. For Adam and LOMO, we set all modules in transformer layers to
be trainable. We adopt the setup in Galore’s paper and apply pure BF16 and 8-bits Adam for all
Galore’s experiments. We apply pure BF16 precision training for LOMO, as it does not support mixed
precision training. Since LOMO does not support gradient accumulation, its batch size is smaller
than the other approaches (consequently, it runs more steps) to ensure aligned memory consumption;
see Appendix B.2 for more detail.

Additional implementation details.

• All the experiments in Section 3.1 are conducted using a single RTX3090-24GB. We use
4×A100-80GB GPUs to finetune the Llama 3-70B model using LoRA and BAdam.

---Page Break---
• For all the experiments of finetuning Llama models, we apply the gradient checkpointing
technique [11] to reduce the memory cost of storing activations for all methods. In particular,
we checkpoint the input of each transformer layer and re-forward to calculate the layer’s
activations during the backward phase.
• The experiments on finetuning Llama models are implemented using Llama-Factory [69].
The SuperGLUE experiments are based on the implementation of jiant [47].

B.2
Hyperparameters

We summarize the choices of hyperparameters for SuperGLUE, instruction tuning, and math finetun-
ing in Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10, respectively. Some discussions follow:

• BAdam introduces only one additional hyperparameter compared to Adam, namely, K in
Algorithm 1. One natural choice is K =
n
BD, where n is the number of training data points,
B is the effective batch size, and D is the number of blocks in BAdam. We round
n
BD to the
nearest integer if it is a fractional. Such a setting ensures that after one block-epoch, all the
n training data points are equally distributed to the D blocks for training. On another front,
too small K may result in insufficient Adam steps, while too large K may over-optimize
one block before moving to others. Therefore, one possible choice is

K = min
n
max
n n

BD, 50
o
, 100
o
.
(7)

The suggested selection is merely a guideline. One may also choose other reasonable values
for K based on
n
BD, once each of the D blocks is appropriately trained with a reasonable
amount of data.
• For applying LoRA to finetune the Llama 2-7B model, we set LoRA rank to be 100 so that
it has as many trainable parameters as BAdam at each iteration. However, when finetuning
the Llama 3-8B model, using rank 100 results in out-of-memory error, as shown in Table 2.
We observe that LoRA with rank 8 and rank 100 achieve similar MT-bench scores for
finetuning the Llama 2-7B model, corroborating the conclusion in LoRA paper [22, Section
7.2] that the LoRA rank does not essentially affect its performance. Therefore, we report the
performance of LoRA with rank 8 for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model.

We display the online loss under different block switch strategies and inner Adam step choices for
each block sub-problem in Figure 4. The results are based on finetuning Llama 3-8B on Alpaca-GPT4
dataset.

We compare three block ordering strategies including descending (from the output to the input
module), ascending (from the input to the output module), and random reshuffling. As shown in
Figure 4a, although the descending scheme initially converges more slowly, all three ordering schemes
finally exhibit nearly identical convergence behaviors. As shown in Figure 4b, different choices
of Adam steps K does not affect the convergence of online training loss evidently for the task of
finetuning Llama 3-8B. However, we notice that the convergence speed may vary across different
models for different values of K. One can refer to (7) for a detailed discussion on selecting K.

Table 11: SuperGLUE benchmark scores of the finetuned RoBERTa-
large using different optimization methods.

We test the performance of BAdam on classification tasks by training RoBERTa-large [32] on the
SuperGLUE benchmark [56]. The implementation is based on jiant [47] using a single RTX3090.
The setting of hyperparameters is put in Appendix B.2. We display the test results on 6 tasks selected
from the SuperGLUE benchmark. We choose these tasks to conduct experiments since they are
selected in [37, 38]. The results can be found in Table 11. It can be observed that BAdam outperforms
LoRA in 5 out of the 6 tasks. Furthermore, BAdam demonstrates performance that is comparable to,
or tied with, Adam. Based on these results, we can conclude that BAdam is capable of closing the
performance gap with Adam more efficiently than LoRA. Consequently, we extrapolate that BAdam
has the potential to perform nearly as well as Adam, even when finetuning larger models.

Continue Pretrain Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on StarCoder Dataset

We conduct a preliminary continue pretraining experiment on StarCoder-Python [28] dataset, which
consists of repositories from GitHub, including GitHub issues and commits. We train Llama 3.1-8B-
Instruct on Starcoder dataset using BAdam, with learning rate 1e-5 and batch size 160. The training
loss is shown in Figure 5. One can see that BAdam effectively decreases the CPT loss to around 0.89
after being trained for 10 billion tokens (about 1 epoch).

Memory Consumption and Running Time for Finetuning Llama 2-7B

We present the memory consumption for finetuning the Llama 2-7B model in Table 12. We can see
that all the methods successfully finetune Llama 2-7B within 24GB memory, and the cost for each
part corroborates our interpretation in Section 2.2.

We also display the time costs for finetuning the Llama 2-7B model in Table 13 and Table 14. One
can see that LoRA requires approximately twice the forward time cost when fine-tuning the Llama
2-7B model. This additional cost may be attributed to implementation-level overhead. Notably,
finetuning the Llama 2-7B model requires a much longer training time compared to that of the Llama
3-8B model, as the latter utilizes grouped query attention that significantly improves both inference
and backward efficiency.

Convergence Analysis

To establish the convergence of BAdam, we first prove a descent inequality for updates applied to one
block by bounding the error terms introduced by Adam updates. Integrating these descent inequalities
across different blocks shows that BAdam is a descent method and has a complexity bound of O(δ−2).
For a compact and clear convergence analysis, we focus on BAdam with deterministic gradients,
leaving the stochastic cases for future work.

We make the following two assumptions. Assumption D.1 is standard for analyzing block coordinate
descent-type methods [58]. Assumption D.2 is commonly used in the analysis of Adam [13]. We
adopt this assumption for simplicity of presentation, noting that it can be provably ensured [27].
Assumption D.1. The loss function L is L-smooth. And when restricted on i-th block, it is Li-smooth.
Mathematically,

∥∇L(θ1) −∇L(θ2)∥≤L∥θ1 −θ2∥,

We define parameters ¯L = maxi=1,...,D Li as the maximum smoothness constants across all blocks
and ¯L = mini=1,...,D Li.
Assumption D.2. BAdam has bounded partial derivatives along its trajectory, i.e., there exists G > 1
such that
∥gt,k
i ∥≤G.
Here, we adopt the notations as specified in Algorithm 1: t = 0, . . . , T are block epochs, i =
1, . . . , D are different blocks, k = 0, . . . , K are inner iterations over data for a certain block, and
gt,k
i
= ∇iL(θt
i) =
∂L
∂θt,k
i
is the partial derivative w.r.t. the i-th block at t-th block epoch and k-th

inner Adam step. To avoid potential confusion, in this section we denote λ as the numerical stability
constant used in the denominator in Adam’s adaptive step sizes (Line 12 of Algorithm 1) instead of ε,
as the ε is a conventional notation used to represent the target accuracy in optimization community.

Corollary D.3 (bounded adaptive step sizes). Let Ht,k

with 0 < λ < 1, we have:
1
2GI ≼Ht,k

Proof. By definition of ˆv, its elements (ˆvt,k

squared elements (gt,k

j, so we have bound

1≤j≤d(ˆvt,k

Here we formally present the theorem for the convergence of BAdam in Section 2.1. This section
will focus on providing the proof for the theorem.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The major contributions and scope are properly reflected in abstract and the
"Main results" paragraph in Section 1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have summarized the main limitations of this work in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

27


---Page Break---
Justification: In Appendix D, we list all the assumptions used and provide the full proof.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include detailed experiment setup and hyperparameters in Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

28


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our submission includes the detailed setup and command for running the
experiments. We also opensource our code publicly.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In Appendix B, we clearly specify the dataset split, hyperparameters, and
detailed experiment setup.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: For the downstream performance evaluation in Section 3.3, we report the
MT-bench scores across different learning rate schemes and different models. For the
experiments on time cost in Section 3.1, we report the averaged running time over three
epochs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

29


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly report the computer resources of all experiments in the experiment
section; see Section 3. We also report the memory consumption and running time in
Section 3.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper follows the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have summarized the broader impacts of our method in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

30


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not release any data or model in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The used datasets, codes, and models are properly cited based on their licenses.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

31


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We opensource our code implementation publicly and provide detailed docu-
mentation on how to use our code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve any crowdsourcing experiments or any research
with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve any crowdsourcing experiments or any research
with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

32


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
