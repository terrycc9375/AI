Abstract

Large Language Models (LLM) based agents have shown promise in autonomously
completing tasks across various domains, e.g., robotics, games, and web navigation.
However, these agents typically require elaborate design and expert prompts to
solve tasks in speciﬁc domains, which limits their adaptability. We introduce
AutoManual, a framework enabling LLM agents to autonomously build their un-
derstanding through interaction and adapt to new environments. AutoManual
categorizes environmental knowledge into diverse rules and optimizes them in an
online fashion by two agents: 1) The Planner codes actionable plans based on
current rules for interacting with the environment. 2) The Builder updates the rules
through a well-structured rule system that facilitates online rule management and es-
sential detail retention. To mitigate hallucinations in managing rules, we introduce
a case-conditioned prompting strategy for the Builder. Finally, the Formulator agent
compiles these rules into a comprehensive manual. The self-generated manual can
not only improve the adaptability but also guide the planning of smaller LLMs
while being human-readable. Given only one simple demonstration, AutoManual
signiﬁcantly improves task success rates, achieving 97.4% with GPT-4-turbo and
86.2% with GPT-3.5-turbo on ALFWorld benchmark tasks. The code is available
at https://github.com/minghchen/automanual.

Introduction

Recently, autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLM), e.g., ReAct [33], Re-
ﬂexion [16], SayCan [1], WebGPT [10], and Voyager [24], have demonstrated their potential to
complete long-horizon tasks in grounded environments. These LLM agents operate by generating
thoughts and actions that are executable in the environment. For customized environments, such
as robotics [1, 7, 18, 23] and games [14, 24, 39], prior methods provide detailed instructions and
in-context examples to familiarize LLM with action functions (API) and the target environment.
However, unlike these agents, humans can autonomously build and update their understanding of an
unfamiliar environment through dynamic interaction.

Several existing methods enable LLM agents to reﬂect on feedback [16, 21] or save successful
experiences as skills [21, 24, 35] to enhance the performance and reduce the reliance on human-
provided examples. However, these reﬂections and skills have not been well exploited to foster
a deeper understanding of the environment. As a result, directly using saved skills as in-context
examples can lead to the Path Dependence problem, i.e., the agent blindly replicates the paths of
previous successes, failing to adapt appropriately to new scenarios. Such problems are more severe in
real-world situations characterized by high variability.

A previous work, ExpeL [35], gathers the trajectories of LLM agents and extracts cross-task rules from
them. However, these rules are extracted ofﬂine, making ExpeL suffer from the same distributional
shift problem as Ofﬂine RL [6]. Meanwhile, due to the simplicity of rule management, its rules are
always armchair general and unhelpful for the Path Dependency problem. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework called AutoManual to build a well-organized understanding of the environment
that can guide multi-task planning effectively. AutoManual leverages a dynamic rule system that
not only extracts valuable experience, including skills and reﬂections, into different types of rules
but also allows for continuously updating these rules in response to new situations. Additionally,
error-prone details are explicitly described in the rules to improve the robustness of planning.

AutoManual follows two alternating iterative processes to optimize the rules. First, given the
observation and task of an episode, the Planner agent utilizes currently discovered rules to write
free-form code as an actionable plan. The interaction between the environment and the Planner will
loop until the episode ends. Second, based on this trajectory, the Builder agent will update relevant
rules through the rule system. This online updating mechanism can timely verify whether the rules
have deviations and are applicable to the Planner. After rules optimization, the Formulator agent
categorizes these rules according to their application scenarios and compiles a comprehensive manual
in Markdown format.

The challenge lies in enabling the Builder to accurately extract applicable rules from a long trajectory,
as LLM are prone to generating hallucinations. To address this, we employ a case-conditioned
prompting strategy, which directs the Builder to focus on speciﬁc rules according to the case of the
trajectory. For example, if errors occurred in a trajectory, the Builder is ﬁrst asked to determine which
caused the error: an unrecorded situation occurred, or the Planner failed to follow existing rules.
Based on this answer, the Builder will be given corresponding prompts to update relevant rules.

To summarize, our contributions are the following:

• We adopt actionable code as the way for the Planner agent to interact with the environment.
We introduce a structured rule system that allows the Builder agent to manage multiple types
of knowledge from these code-based interactions.

• We propose an alternating process between the Planner and Builder agents to optimize rules
in an online manner and resolve the Path Dependency problem. To improve readability, the
Formulator agent is introduced to reorganize and formalize the rules into a Markdown manual.

• To facilitate rule management, we employ a case-conditioned prompting strategy, which
guides the Builder to manage speciﬁc types of rules for different trajectory cases.

• Starting from a single demonstration, AutoManual can generate detailed instruction manuals
for complex environments like ALFWorld and MiniWoB++. These manuals allow LLM agents
to achieve remarkable success rates of 97.4% with GPT-4-turbo and 86.2% with GPT-3.5-turbo
on ALFWorld, 98.3% with GPT-4-turbo and 92.7% with GPT-3.5-turbo on MiniWoB++.

2.1
LLM for Agents Planning

Large Language Models (LLM) exhibit powerful reasoning and planning capabilities [11, 12, 28,
33, 39] while requiring much fewer demonstrations than traditional learning methods. With this
planning capability as the core, LLM agents are being developed for use in robotics [1, 7, 18,
20, 23], game-playing [14, 24, 27, 39], software development [3, 15], and other ﬁelds [30]. Prior
studies [16, 21, 33] allow agents to adjust actions or plans based on environmental feedback to
improve planning performance. Given the powerful programming capability of LLM, several works,
e.g., CodeAsPolicy [7], ProgPrompt [18] and AdaPlanner [21], propose to use Python code as the
plan of LLM agents. This form of output can automatically respond to in-plan feedback and achieve
better performance than the action and JSON format [21, 25].

2.2
Self-improvement of LLM Agents

Embodied agent research has long sought to enable agents to self-improve through interactive
experiences. Unlike traditional learning-based agents that require extensive iterations for optimization,

2


---Page Break---
Reﬂexion [16] allows LLM agents to reﬂect on previous failures and quickly improve their plans.
Some works [32, 34, 36] combine tree search with reﬂection to deliberately seek a better solution.
Apart from failure experiences, prior studies [21, 24, 39] utilize successful experiences as skills to
assist future planning. Voyager [24] stores generated and veriﬁed programs into the skill library as a
new skill for more complex tasks. AdaPlanner [21] also discovers and archives successful programs
into skill memory for future similar tasks. However, these methods stop updating skills after storing
them, which inevitably leads to the Path Dependency problem.

Another series of works [26, 31, 38] employs LLM as a prompt optimizer to enhance its own
performance. In contrast to our approach, which addresses challenges in unfamiliar environments,
these studies focus on enhancing LLM reasoning performance. As a result, their optimized prompts
are typically brief and lack environmental knowledge.

2.3
Memory Management of LLM Agents

For LLM agents, learning from past experiences can also be viewed as managing the episodic
memory [16]. CLIN [9] proposes to keep updating a memory centered on causal abstractions for
new trials. Retrieval-Augmented Planning (RAP) [4] retrieves past experiences corresponding to
the current situation. MemGPT [13] allows LLM to select content to retain in working memory and
to search for information in long-term memory. Generative Agents [14] retrieve memories based
on recency, importance, and relevance to the current situation. Generative Agents also generate
tree-structured reﬂections, but they focus on a continuous scenario rather than task-oriented rules.

2.4
LLM for Rule Discovery

Several recent works also investigate the rule discovery capabilities of LLM. Zhu et al. [40] propose
Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), enabling LLM to induce and deduce rules for basic reasoning tasks.
For LLM agents, ExpeL [35] gathers the trajectories of Reﬂexion agents and extracts cross-task rules
from them. Furthermore, AutoGuide [2] generates state-aware rules and retrieves rules relevant to
the test-time state. Unlike ExpeL and AutoGuide, which extract rules from ofﬂine experiences, we
update rules in an online manner, verifying their reliability and applicability. For more discussion of
differences, refer to Appendix C.

Methods

3.1
AutoManual Overview

Our AutoManual framework, shown in Fig 1, consists of three main stages. Building stage: The
Planner agent and Builder agent collaborate to build rules from the interactive environment. The
Consolidator agent merges or deletes redundant rules when the rules exceed the maximum rule
number. Formulating stage: The Formulator agent categorizes the rules, summarizes the key points,
and formulates them into a manual in Markdown form. Testing stage: Based on the generated
manual, a test-time Planner agent will be evaluated through test tasks and scenarios.

Formally, an Interactive Environment can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP): (S, A, T , G, O). At the start of each episode, a scenario s0 2 S will be initialized,
a text-grounded task g 2 G and the initial observation o0 2 O (processed into textual form) will
be given. The environment can be interacted with through permissible actions (API) set A. After
executing an action a 2 A, the environment will return the result of the action and the new observation
o0 based on the dynamics T(s0|s, a) 2 T and O(o0|s0). Finally, when the episode is done, a binary
reward r 2 {−1, 1} indicating the failure or success of the task will be returned.

We approach the learning of environmental rules as an optimization problem:

max

⇥Es0,gE⇢(·|⇥)r(⌧⇢)
(1)

where ⇥denotes all rules in our rule system, ⇢(·|⇥) denotes the policy of the Planner given the
current rules ⇥and ⌧⇢denotes a trajectory of ⇢(·|⇥) starting from [o0, g]. Classic policy gradient
methods [29] solve such problems through stochastic gradient ascent, i.e., executing the current
policy to obtain the episodic reward and back-propagating gradients to update the parameters.

Figure 1: AutoManual Overview: AutoManual operates in three stages: (1) Building Stage:
The Planner agent interacts with the environment by coding actionable plans. After receiving the
current trajectory of the Planner, the Builder agent manages rules through the online rule system. (2)
Formulating Stage: The Formulator agent formulates the resulting rules into a Markdown manual.
(3) Testing Stage: A test-time Planner agent utilizes the manual to complete testing tasks.

Inspired by this online reinforcement learning paradigm, we follow two alternative processes to
optimize the rules ⇥: 1. The Planner practices the current rules through interaction within an episode.
2. The Builder updates the rules ⇥based on this trajectory. Compared to traditional parameter
optimization, sample-inefﬁcient gradient ascent is replaced by text-based rule management. We
design a well-structured rule system described in Section 3.3 to ensure the rule updating contributes
to rewards. Additionally, to limit the role of human expertise, we only provide a simple example
demonstrating the output format to agents. Then, manually derive several initial rules from this
example as the starting point of the optimization.

3.2
Planner Agent for Interactive Planning

As demonstrated by the success of Voyager [24] and AdaPlanner [21], code-based planning can
leverage the powerful programming capability of LLM and automatically react to in-plan feedback.
Voyager and AdaPlanner output and reﬁne a complete solution function for the task, which is poten-
tially reusable. However, this function-form output is difﬁcult to adjust in response to environmental
feedback, as it requires maintaining the integrity of the plan throughout.

Our Planner Agent outputs free-form code as its plan, which aligns more with the natural programming
capabilities of LLM [7, 22]. This form simpliﬁes planning by only generating code necessary for
the current environmental situation and feedback without the overhead of integrating previously
executed code. As shown in Fig 2, at the start of a new episode, the Planner receives system prompts,
current rules ⇥, relevant samples from the skill and reﬂection libraries, the target task g, and initial
observation o0. System prompts contain the role, permissible actions A, response guidelines, and a
simple example (detailed in Appendix H). The output of the Planner is structured into four segments
during each cycle:

1. Analysis: The understanding of the current situation and reﬂection on previous errors if exist.

2. Related Rules: Rules (along with their IDs) that need to be considered in this situation.

3. Overall Plan: The general plan to complete the task.

4. Code: A block of Python code divided into steps. The Planner is encouraged to deﬁne helpful

functions in the code, which might be reusable in similar scenarios.

We denote this response of the Planner as [thoughtt, codet], where thoughtt denotes the ﬁrst three seg-
ments. codet executed in the environment is followed by feedback ct, which informs the subsequent
output cycle. This process iterates until the episode ends or a response limit is reached.

The Trajectory

Figure 2: The Planner Trajectory: Given the current task and rules, the Planner will interact with
the environment through free-form code. Based on the trajectory result, the Planner will generate a
corresponding conclusion, which will be saved in the skill or reﬂection library.

As shown in Fig 2, according to the episodic reward, we categorize the result into Direct Success,
Indirect Success (errors occurred but were solved later), and Failure. In the case of Direct or Indirect
Success, the Planner will be prompted to organize its previous code into a code block. For Indirect
Success, it additionally summarizes the mistakes and misunderstandings that cause errors. For the
Failure case, the Planner will be prompted to reﬂect on the reason for the failure carefully, suggest
reasonable corrections, and specify the code segment that caused the error. We denote this response
of the Planner as conclusion. Finally, we obtain a trajectory of the Planner:

⌧⇢= (o0, g, [thought1, code1], c1, ..., [thoughtT , codeT ], cT , conclusion)
(2)

Skill Library and Reﬂection Library: Apart from rules, we also manage and transmit conclusions
from previous episodes, which provide essential details for generating planning code. In the case
of Direct or Indirect Success, we save the code block in conclusion as a skill for that task type 1
into the skill library [21, 24]. In the Failure case, we save its conclusion as a reﬂection for that task
type into the reﬂection library. When a new task comes, the code block of the most similar task is
retrieved from the skill library. If there is no existing skill for the new task type, the reﬂection for that
task type will be returned. As mentioned in the Introduction, compared with rules, these skills and
reﬂections contain more programming details but are less generalizable to new scenarios, i.e., the
Path Dependence problem.

Cooperation between Agents: In our framework, rule management is not solely the responsibility
of the Builder; the Planner also plays a critical role by explicitly identifying the rules it engages in its
response. This cooperation is facilitated by including the Planner’s thoughts within the trajectory
⌧, which is provided to the Builder. This synergy enhances the identiﬁcation and adjustment of
problematic rules. In addition, conclusion from the Planner contains the detailed success process or
reﬂections on errors, which further assist the Builder in managing corresponding types of rules.

3.3
Builder and Consolidator Agents for Rule Management

Upon receiving the trajectory ⌧⇢, the Builder has to manage the rules through the rule system.

1All tasks in ALFWorld are divided into 6 task types, e.g., pick_heat_then_place, look_at_obj_in_light. For
each task type, we store only one skill code.

Figure 3: Case-Conditioned Prompts: Given the current trajectory, the Builder classiﬁes the cause
of the major error as "Imperfect Rules" or "Imperfect Agents". Then, the Builder will get the base
prompt and corresponding prompt to guide its rule management.

Rule System: We intuitively identify rules as the kinds of knowledge that help task completion,
including the analyses of the observed phenomenon T(o0|o, a), the mechanism T(s0|s, a), and the
correlation between the reward r and ⌧⇢, i.e., the success process or the occurred error. Therefore,
unlike ExpeL [35] and AutoGuide [2], which derive general insight from the trajectory, our system
categorizes six speciﬁc rule types to extract environmental knowledge that targets different aspects of
the trajectory. Furthermore, each rule in our system is enhanced with Example attribute to illustrate
its application and important details, making it grounded and well-understood. Speciﬁcally, each rule
in the rule system has these four attributes:

1. Rule Type: The type of the rule, chosen from [“Special Phenomenon”, “Special Mechanism”,

“Useful Helper Method”, “Success Process”, “Corrected Error”, “Unsolved Error”];

2. Rule Content: A description of the rule, beginning with the scope of its applicable scenarios;

3. Example: An example or code from the trajectory demonstrates this rule, where additional

remarks, e.g. error-prone details, can also be added to it;

4. Validation Logs: Logs that track the rule’s application and updates, including episode and

rule IDs that trace the rule’s evolution, serving as a reference for the Builder and Consolidator.

The Builder manages the rules through the following functions of the rule system:

• write_rule(**rule_attributes): Write down a new rule with its four attributes.

• update_rule(rule_id, **rule_attributes): Rewrite the attributes of a existing rule.

• stop_generating(): When the trajectory is not needed or insufﬁcient to derive any more new
rules, the function should be called.

Similar to hierarchical reﬂections in Generative Agents [14], we allow the Builder to utilize existing
rules to induce more general or deeper rules and record their dependence in Rule Content or Validation
Logs, more discussed in Appendix D.

Case-Conditioned Prompting: To mitigate the risk of erroneous rule creation, such as deriving rules
of success from a failed trajectory, we employ case-conditioned prompts. As illustrated in Fig 3, the
Builder ﬁrst analyzes and determines if the major errors stem from “Imperfect Rules” or “Imperfect
Agent”. Based on this analysis and the trajectory results, targeted prompts guide the Builder in rule
management 2. For example, in a case of indirect success due to imperfect rules (Case 2), the prompts
will guide the Builder to extract or update the success process, helper methods, and error reﬂections

2Notice: These prompts for the Builder are environment-independent and shared across all environments.

in corresponding rule types. Finally, the Builder responds with the potential rules detailing their
relation with existing rules and uses the functions of the rule system to manage rules.

Rule Consolidation: When the number of rules in the rule system exceeds Nmax, the Consolidator
agent steps in to consolidate related rules and delete redundant rules. It uses three functions of the rule
system: get_trajectory(episode_id), update_rule(rule_id, **rule_attributes) and delete_rule(rule_id).
Given the current rules, the Consolidator identiﬁes potentially relevant or overlapped rules, uses
get_trajectory function to investigate the trajectories they depend on, and ﬁnally calls the remaining
functions to manage the rules. During the management, the Consolidator ensures that consolidation
retains details of rules and examples.

3.4
Manual Formulation

Once the building stage is complete, we can obtain a set of rules targeted to different situations,
whose applicability has been validated through online optimization. Our next goal is to enhance
their readability and global understanding. To achieve this, we introduce the Formulator agent,
designed to transform these rules into a user-friendly manual, analogous to a teacher imparting a
wealth of knowledge through easily digestible lessons. As depicted in Fig 1, the Formulator begins by
categorizing all rules based on their target scenarios. This categorization aids in structuring the manual
and ensures that related rules are discussed together, which enhances the logical ﬂow and accessibility
of the information. For each category, the Formulator drafts an introduction, summarizing the rules
it contains and highlighting the key points and overall principles that govern the speciﬁc scenarios.
Finally, the Formulator compiles the rules and their introductions into a comprehensive manual
formatted in Markdown.

4
Experiments

In line with prior works [2, 21], we conduct the experiments on three interactive environments: (1)
ALFWorld [17] is a text-based virtual household environment containing six distinct task types.
We run the building stage on 36 tasks (6 tasks for each task type) sampled from the training set of
ALFWorld, and each task is run only once. Following previous works [16, 21, 33], we run the testing
stage on the validation unseen set containing 134 tasks across these six types. (2) MiniWoB++ [8]
is a simulated web environment where agents complete diverse tasks on the Internet by performing
keyboard and mouse actions. Prior works [5, 21] selects 9 task types with environmental feedback
and 44 task types without feedback from MiniWoB++ tasks. We perform experiments on 9 task
types with feedback or on all 53 task types. At each stage, we randomly sample 6 tasks for each task
type. (3) WebArena [37] introduces realistic web environments by emulating the functionality and
data of popular websites. This benchmark poses signiﬁcant challenges for LLM agents due to its
large observation and action space, along with tasks that require longer planning horizons. Following
AutoGuide [2], our experiments focus on the Reddit domain within WebArena.

During the building and formulating stages, we use GPT-4-turbo (gpt-4-1106-preview) for all
agents. At the testing stage, we equip the Planner agent with GPT-4-turbo or GPT-3.5-turbo
(gpt-3.5-turbo-1106), to evaluate the effect of generated manuals on relatively smaller LLM.

Compared Methods: In the experiments, we compare AutoManual with the following methods
of LLM Agent: (1) ReAct [33] prompts LLM to generate the reasoning trace using CoT [28] and
next-step action; (2) Reﬂexion [16] agents generate reﬂection on task feedback signals, which is
saved in the memory for subsequent trials; (3) ExpeL [35] extract insights and skills from the ofﬂine
trajectories of Reﬂexion agents; (4) RCI [5] agent recursively criticizes and improves its output for
solving computer tasks; (5) AdaPlanner [21] allows the LLM agent to generate and adaptively reﬁne
a code-style plan; (6) Planner+Lib. represents our Planner agent equipped with skill and reﬂection
libraries (§3.2) during building and testing stages without any rules. We re-implement prior methods
with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions the same as ours for fair comparisons.

ReAct, Reﬂexion, and ExpeL provide LLM agents with 12 human examples (2 examples per task
type) of ALFWorld. For AdaPlanner, they provide 6 human examples (1 example per task type) of
ALFWorld as the start of skill discovery. For our methods, agents are provided only one human
example of the simplest task (Put) on ALFWorld. On MiniWob++, our agents are provided one human
example (search-engine) for tasks with feedback and 4 examples for all tasks. On WebArena, our

Main Results on ALFWorld: As shown in Tab. 1, AutoMan-
ual signiﬁcantly outperforms the existing methods, evidenced
by overall success rates of 86.2% when using GPT-3.5-turbo
for the testing stage and 97.4% when using GPT-4-turbo. No-
ticeably, AutoManual requires little expert prior knowledge
about the environment and is only provided with one human
example to achieve excellent results. In comparison, the rules
induced by ExpeL hardly improve performance, as its ofﬂine
trajectories are composed of individual actions rather than code. We ﬁnd the performance of AdaPlan-
ner is lower than reported. One reason is that AdaPlanner requires LLM to output speciﬁc formats to
complete its function-form code, which is difﬁcult for creative LLM, e.g., GPT-4-turbo. In addition,
AdaPlanner and Planner+Lib. are inferior to AutoManual because they only store successful paths as
skills and inevitably face the Path Dependence problem. Especially, tasks in Put Two have various
scenarios, such as “two objects can occur at the same receptacle or different receptacles”, that require
different processes to solve (Appendix G shows an example). Furthermore, Planner+Lib. often
does not mark error-prone points in its skills, such as “target objects may appear in unconventional
locations”.

Main Results on MiniWoB++: As shown in Tab. 2, the performance of AutoManual exceeds the
previous methods and Planner+Lib. by a large margin. Especially in 9 task types with feedback, these
tasks have higher diversity and require LLM agents to cope with various situations. For example,
the tasks in login-user-popup type will interrupt the agent’s plan at any time, requiring the agent to
cope with unexpected situations. Therefore, solely imitating previous successful experiences without
extracting targeted rules will lead to task failure. Additionally, due to the ﬂexibility of free-form codes,
our method shows better adaptability while requiring fewer expert examples than prior methods.

Learning Curves. We show the success rate curves (testing with GPT-4-turbo or GPT-3.5-turbo)
when gradually increasing the tasks of the building stage in Fig 4. In the left image, we share rules
across all task types (Cross-task Type), as in AutoManual, or each task type builds a separate set of
rules (Single-task Type) during the building stage. Fig 4 (a) demonstrates that sharing rules across
task types can facilitate rule optimization. The rules for each task type deepen understanding of the
environment, thereby boosting the planning of other tasks. In Fig 4 (b), we compare AutoManual and
Planner+Lib. on 9 tasks with feedback in MiniWob++. We ﬁnd that Planner+Lib. tends to get stuck
with a lower success rate. In the face of highly diverse scenarios, Skill Library cannot express the
rules behind the environment, thus falling into the Path Dependency problem.

4.2
Ablation Study

In this ablation study, we quantify the impact of each core component of the AutoManual framework
on performance, speciﬁcally focusing on success rates and error reduction during task execution.
Since we allowed the Planner to replan up to 3 times, each task could have up to 4 error steps.

Online v.s. Ofﬂine Rule Management: We perform ofﬂine AutoManual by collecting all trajectories
and then managing rules from them. As Tab 4 shows, without online rule management, the generated
manual can only slightly improve planning (from 88.1% to 90.7%). This is because more mundane
mistakes and fewer direct successes will occur in the trajectories (the distributional shift problem),
and the rules cannot be veriﬁed by feedback from the environment.

Skill&Reﬂection Libraries: Retrieving historical conclusions is essential for correct planning, as
they record massive interacting details that can complement the rules. Without them, there will be

9


---Page Break---
more errors in the details, and the success rate drops from 97.4% to 89.5%. However, as discussed
previously, using plain experiences without inducing rules will lead to Path Dependency.

Case-Conditional Prompts: This strategy further improves the rule management process by reducing
the hallucination, as evidenced by an increase in success rate from 93.8% to 97.4%. These prompts
ensure that the Builder updates rules reasonably and grounded.

Effect of Manual Formulation: The ﬁnal formulation of rules into a comprehensive manual
contributed to the success rate of 97.4% and decreased average error steps, demonstrating the
effectiveness of presenting rule-based knowledge in an organized and accessible format. It not only
aids the Planner in mastering multiple rules but is also friendly for human reading.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce AutoManual, a framework signiﬁcantly advancing LLM agents by enabling
adaptability and continual learning through online rule optimization. Utilizing the structured rule
system, AutoManual autonomously generates comprehensive manuals, achieving high success rates
in benchmarks like ALFWorld and MiniWoB++. This approach reduces reliance on human-provided
examples and expert interventions, illustrating a robust method for enhancing agent generalization
and addressing the Path Dependency problem in diverse environments.

A
Limitations

Despite the signiﬁcant contributions of the AutoManual framework, several limitations warrant
further discussion. First, our method heavily relies on the capabilities of GPT-4-turbo to generate
reliable rules, which may limit the framework’s applicability with less advanced language models.

Secondly, the current implementation places all rules directly within the context of LLM, which,
while effective in smaller or moderately complex environments, may not scale well to larger, more
dynamic settings. For such expansive environments, integrating the rule system with Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, similar to the approach taken by AutoGuide [2], could
enhance performance by dynamically selecting relevant rules based on the context, thereby managing
the cognitive load on the LLM more efﬁciently.

Thirdly, for complex and challenging tasks, the agents of AutoManual are insufﬁcient in exploring
the environment, as they only attempt solutions based on current knowledge. To enhance agents’
exploration of unfamiliar environments, it may be necessary to endow the agent with curiosity [24] or
combine it with tree search algorithms [32].

Lastly, there remains a challenge in ensuring that the Planner agent consistently adheres to the
rules outlined in the manual. In practice, the Planner may sometimes ignore these rules (or have
hallucinations about observations) and cannot generate the ideal solution code that can be applied
to different situations. This indicates a need for additional mechanisms to enforce or verify rule
compliance during operations. This issue underscores the potential necessity for developing more
sophisticated methods to ensure rule adherence or to introduce more robust validation steps within
the planning process.

Broader Impacts

The AutoManual framework, leveraging LLM agents, presents positive and negative impacts on
safety. On the positive side, by autonomously generating reliable manuals, our method enhances the
predictability and reliability of LLM behaviors in dynamic environments, potentially reducing errors
and increasing operational safety. However, relying on LLMs also introduces risks of unpredictable
behaviors when agents encounter unanticipated scenarios or when rule adherence is not fully ensured.

Furthermore, the manuals generated by our method can be invaluable tools for human workers. They
encapsulate a distilled form of interaction-based learning that can aid in training, provide decision
support, and improve task efﬁciency in various domains. This can not only enhance productivity but
also ensure that human workers are better informed and prepared to manage the complex systems
with which they interact.

Lastly, AutoManual’s ability to generate structured, context-aware manuals from interactive experi-
ences suggests a promising avenue for constructing comprehensive knowledge bases for AI. These
manuals can contribute to a global knowledge base shared by LLMs of different sizes, promoting
broader AI research and development. It offers a method to systematically organize and retrieve
complex interaction data in a way that is accessible and useful for both machines and humans.

C
Difference with Prior Methods

We compare AutoManual with prior methods that extract rules from experiences, i.e., ExpeL [35]
and AutoGuide [2], and discuss all differences here:

1) Interactive Form. ExpeL and AutoGuide, following Reﬂexion [16], each time output the thought

and next-step action to interact with the environment. Our Planner agent interacts using free-form
code. As evidenced by previous works [7, 25], using code as the plan is more efﬁcient because
the code will automatically perform the in-plan actions and require LLM responses far fewer times.
Additionally, planning with code can enjoy the powerful programming capability of GPT. More
importantly, compared with action sequences, code is easier to generalize to similar scenarios,
facilitating the management.

2) Online v.s. Ofﬂine. ExpeL and AutoGuide extract rules from ofﬂine experiences of Reﬂexion
agent. We update rules online by alternating rule practice and rule management. This online rule
management can verify the reliability and applicability of the rules in a timely manner, forbidding
rules to be armchair general. Additionally, online-update rules can help planners continuously
improve their trajectories, making it easier for higher-quality success processes to emerge.

3) Collaboration Between Agents. Building rules online also enables collaboration between the
Planner and Builder agents. In our AutoManual, the Planner is prompted to describe the rules
considered and analyze special phenomena, which ease the management of the Builder. In contrast,
the builder in ExpeL and AutoGuide can only receive action sequences from the Planner.

4) Rule System. In ExpeL and AutoGuide, each rule has only two attributes: the content and score.
In our rule system, each rule has four attributes: "Type", "Content", "Example", and "Logs". These
attributes provide a comprehensive representation of rules and facilitate the management and usage
of rules. Moreover, we allow rules to build on top of other rules.

5) Handling excessive rules. ExpeL and AutoGuide utilize the rule scores to delete the low-score
rules. However, we found that rule scores are unreliable in the experiments because the Builder tends
to give overconﬁdent scores to all rules. Instead, our AutoManual employs a Consolidator agent to
merge and delete redundant rules.

D
Implementation Details

In the building stage of all experiments, the maximum number of rules was set to 12 to balance
the context length and rule diversity. We use OpenAI’s Assistant API for all agents to save their
history and prevent duplicate inputs. We set all LLMs’ temperatures to 0 and maximum context
length to 16000. Reﬂexion agents are allowed to try at most 3 trials for each task. For AdaPlanner
and AutoManual, we allow the Planner agent to replan at most 3 times on ALFWorld and 6 times on

MiniWob++ in response to the environmental feedback. In the Building stage on ALFWorld, we use
6 tasks for each task type, a total of 36 tasks, by default. We shufﬂe all tasks, and when tasks in a task
type succeed three times in a row during building, we consider that this task type has been solved and
will no longer run it. The API call cost for building and formulating stages is about $14 in total.

We made a slight modiﬁcation to the text format of ALFWorld to make it more suitable for code: for
each object, "object id" was changed to "object_id", and all preceding articles were removed. The
maximum action step for a task is set to 50.

For the 9 tasks with feedback on Miniwob++, we ﬁnd that "email-inbox-nl-turk" and "email-inbox-
forward-nl-turk" are repetitions of "email-inbox" and "email-inbox-forward-nl". Therefore, we only
used 7 task types in the building stage, while in the testing stage, all 9 types were evaluated. In the
building stage, we run a total of 42 tasks (6 tasks for each type).

For all 53 tasks on Miniwob++, since running the building directly will lead to a large number of
rules, and tasks without feedback have low variability, we adopt a two-step building strategy: we ﬁrst
run our building stage on 9 task types with feedback and then only update the skill and reﬂection
libraries on 44 task types without feedback. The 4 examples for experiments on all task types are
from the following task types: ‘click-menu’, ‘enter-date’, ‘social-media-some’. We chose these tasks
mainly because they are difﬁcult for GPT-4-turbo to try out due to the lack of HTML feedback. For
example, the HTML in ‘enter-date’ will not display the cursor but requires the cursor at the correct
position to enter.

Environmental feedback on executing code in MiniWob++ is as follows: Whenever one of the actions
is executed, we will log whether the action was executed successfully or failed. Finally, the results of
these actions are concatenated together, and used as feedback of the code along with the HTML text.

For AdaPlanner [21] and RCI [5], we use their ofﬁcial code on GitHub to implement their methods.
We ﬁx their bugs on matching text patterns but still ﬁnd their performance is much lower than they
reported. This may be because they have not released the code used in their papers, or their methods
are greatly affected by the GPT version (newer versions of GPT will be more creative).

Presentation of Generated Manuals

We present the generated manual3 on ALFWorld by AutoManual in Fig 5. As shown in the manual,
the Formulator agent categorizes the rules into four categories: “Navigation and Search”, “Object
Interaction and Location Management”, “Task-Speciﬁc Processes”, and “Correctness and Validation”
with clear introductions. We ﬁnd our agents have found and recorded lots of important rules that
directly impact task completion. For instance, “the agent should include all possible locations in its
search” in rule_0, “The agent can only hold one object at a time” in rule_3, and “When multiple
items of the same type are present at a location, the agent may have to choose one to interact with or
examine.” in rule_5. For tasks that can be solved by a ﬁxed strategy, such as “Cool”, “Heat”, “Clean”
and “Examine”, AutoManual provides clear Success Process type rules. For the complex task, “Put
Two”, AutoManual conducts classiﬁed discussions in its Success Process rule.

These demonstrate that AutoManual resolves the Path Dependency problem of skills by dig-
ging deeper into mechanisms, updating and incorporating success processes, and annotating
important details.

Moreover, we prompt the Builder to break down large phenomena into speciﬁc rules and derive
deeper rules from them later. In the initial rules 9, we give a simple example of how to build rules
upon rules. In the manual 5, we ﬁnd that the Builder can correctly utilize rules recording basic
mechanisms to build more complex rules. For example, rule_4 uses rule_3 to induce a solution: “If
all objects are found at the same location, handle them sequentially according to rule_3.”

However, we ﬁnd the generated manual is still not perfect. There are some unnecessary duplicates
between rules, such as rule_7 and rule_8, which are both Success Process type rules for "Examine"
tasks, but they are divided into two rules.

Housekeeper Agent Interaction Manual
 

Overview
 

This manual is intended to assist the housekeeper agent in the successful execution of tasks within a simulated environment. The rules

provide guidance on navigating, searching the environment, interacting with objects, and managing task-specific processes, as well as

ensuring the correctness of actions using code assertions.

Navigation and Search
 

Introduction
 

These rules provide guidance on how to search for objects, including the use of helper methods to streamline the process and ensure

thoroughness.

Included Rules
 

rule_0 (type="Special Mechanism"): Objects can be found in unconventional locations, and the agent should include all possible

locations in its search. For example, In epoch_9, the agent found a soapbar on the toilet, which is an unconventional location for storing

such items.

rule_1 (type="Useful Helper Method"): If there are multiple receptacles to be search, the agent can write and use 'find_object' method

as shown in the example. For example,

Object Interaction and Location Management
 

Introduction
 

These rules inform the agent on how to interact with objects, from taking and placing items to handling multiple items of the same type.

Proper location management is crucial for successful task execution.

Included Rules
 

rule_2 (type="Special Phenomena"): When using a microwave, the agent can interact with it (e.g., heat an object) even if there is

another object inside, the agent is holding something, and the microwave door is not explicitly mentioned to be open.

For example, In epoch_1, the agent was able to heat the mug with the microwave even though there was an egg inside the microwave

and the agent was holding the mug.

rule_3 (type="Special Mechanism"): The agent can only hold one object at a time and must put down any held object before taking

another.

For example, In epoch_2, the agent was holding statue_4 and attempted to take statue_3 without putting down statue_4 first, resulting in

a 'Nothing happens' observation.

rule_4 (type="Success Process"): When tasked with placing multiple objects in/on a receptacle, the agent can either collect all objects

before attempting to place them or find and place them one by one, ensuring they revisit locations with multiple objects if necessary. If

all objects are found at the same location, handle them sequentially according to rule_3.

For example, In epoch_15, the agent should have revisited sidetable_1 to collect the second pencil before attempting to place it in

coffeetable_1. In epoch_23, the agent failed to collect all required statues from coffeetable_1 because it did not revisit, is also addressed

by this rule.

# Define helper method to find object that is needed

def find_object(agent, recep_to_check, object_name):

  for receptacle in recep_to_check:

      observation = agent.go_to(receptacle)

      # Check if we need to open the receptacle. If we do, open it.

      if 'closed' in observation:

          observation = agent.open(receptacle)

      # Check if the object is in/on the receptacle.

      if object_name in observation:

          object_ids = get_object_with_id(observation, object_name)

          return object_ids, receptacle

  return None, None

# Use assertions to validate each step

assert object_ids is not None, "Error: Could not find the object."

Figure 5: The Generated Manual for ALFWorld: Part 1.

17


---Page Break---
rule_5 (type="Special Mechanism"): The agent must interact with a receptacle to observe its contents, which includes going to the

receptacle and opening it if it is closed. Before performing a put or take action, the agent must ensure it is at the correct location. When

multiple items of the same type are present at a location, the agent may have to choose one to interact with or examine.

For example, In epoch_16, the agent had to open several closed cabinets (e.g., cabinet_1, cabinet_2) to find items such as the mug. In

epoch_21, the agent observed multiple alarm clocks on desk_1 and selected one ('alarmclock_4') to interact with.

Task-Specific Processes
 

Introduction
 

This category outlines the steps required to complete specific tasks, such as heating, cooling, and examining objects with another object's

assistance.

Included Rules
 

rule_6 (type="Success Process"): If the task involves cooling or heating an object before placing it, the steps are: (1) search for the object

using 'find_object' in rule_1, (2) take the object, (3) cool/heat it as required, (4) go to the target receptacle, and (5) put the object. Ensure

the agent's location and the state of the environment are updated after each action. For example,

rule_7 (type="Success Process"): When tasked with examining an object under a desklamp, the agent should first find the desklamp

and the object, ensure the desklamp is on, take the object, and then use the desklamp to examine the object. For example,

rule_8 (type="Success Process"): When tasked to look at an object under a desklamp, ensure the lamp is on before using it to examine

the object. For example,

Correctness and Validation
 

Introduction
 

Instructions on asserting code to confirm state changes and enhance the reliability of the agent's actions.

Included Rules
 

rule_9 (type="Corrected Error"): Assertions in the agent's code should confirm state changes such as location or held objects, rather

than rely on specific phrases in observations.

For example, Instead of asserting 'You are at' in the observation, the agent should assert the location and held object state changes. Also,

when handling multiple required objects at the same location, the agent should manage them sequentially without unnecessary

variables.

# For example, to cool a mug and put it in a coffeemachine:

# [Step 1] Use 'find_object' method to search all receptacles

# [Step 2] Take the mug

# [Step 3] Go to the fridge, open it if necessary, and cool the mug

# [Step 4] Go to the coffeemachine and put the cooled mug in it

# [Step 1] Use 'find_object' method to search for the desklamp and the object

# [Step 2] Make sure the desklamp is on

# [Step 3] Take the object

# [Step 4] Use the desklamp to examine the object.

# [Step 4] Go to the desklamp's location and turn it on if it's not already on

observation = agent.go_to(receptacle_with_desklamp)

observation = agent.use(found_desklamp)

assert 'turn on' in observation or 'already on' in observation, 'Error in [Step 4]: Failed to use the desklamp.'

# [Step 5] Similarly, search for the alarm clock and take it.

# [Step 6] With the desklamp on, examine the alarm clock using the desklamp.

Ablation Study of Rule System

The well-structured rule system is essential for the rule management and usage. We perform the
ablation study of our rule system in Tab 7.

• AutoManual without “Type”: we remove the “Type” attribute of each rule in the rule system and
the instruction for the Builder to manage various types of rules. As shown in Tab 7, without the
“Type” attribute, the performance drops signiﬁcantly, from 86.2% to 74.6% and 97.4% to 91.5%,

as the Builder cannot manage speciﬁc types of rules and loses speciﬁc instruction on each rule.

• AutoManual without “Example”: we remove the “Example” attribute of each rule in the rule
system. The performance also drops by a large margin, as the Builder cannot specify necessary
details in rules, and rules with lower understandability can sometimes be misleading to the Planner.

• AutoManual without “Validation Logs” has little impact on performance, but “Validation Logs” of
rules are very useful during debugging.

We also conducted some detailed ablation studies of our AutoManual in Tab 7.

• Helper methods deﬁned by humans and the Planner can serve as the solution for a subgoal of a
task that can be used in multiple tasks. AutoManual without “Useful Helper Method”: we remove
the “Useful Helper Method” in the “Type” attribute, the human example, and initial rules, and we
no longer encourage the Planner to write helper functions when writing code. The performance
drops from 86.2% to 79.6% and 97.4% to 94.3%, demonstrating that extracting reusable helper
methods can facilitate the programming.

• AutoManual without Cooperation between Agents: we remove the Planner’s thoughts in the
trajectory when providing it to the Builder and no longer require the Planner to output Relevant
Rules. The performance decreases signiﬁcantly, indicating the thoughts and conclusions of the
Planner are helpful for the Builder to manage rules.

• Case-Conditioned Prompts without Classiﬁcation: we remove the requirement to classify the error
reason to “Imperfect Rules” or “Imperfect Agents” and only use the prompts for “Imperfect Rules”
during case-conditioned prompting. As demonstrated in Tab 7, the results are inferior to using all
5 cases because the analysis and classiﬁcation of error reason can boost the Builder to manage
rules accurately.

F.2
Sensitivity Analysis of Examples and Initial Rules

We analyze the sensitivity of our rule optimization to the initial condition, i.e., the human example
and initial rules. In the experiments on 9 task types with feedback of MiniWob++, we use an example
of search-engine task and the corresponding initial rules, which are shown in Listing 8 and 9. In
these initial rules, we extract the successful process of search-engine task and a helper method
to turn to the next page. Here, we provide AutoManual with an example of enter-text task, the
simplest task type in MiniWob++, as shown in Listing 10.

The results in Tab 8 demonstrate that even if given less initial knowledge, AutoManual can still auto-
matically learn the required knowledge through online optimization, which shows that AutoManual
has good robustness to the initial rules. In addition, we found that the knowledge it learned about
search-engine is highly similar to the standard knowledge provided by humans, such as the need
to turn pages for the search index larger than 3.

An Example of Path Dependency Problem

In the following example, the existing skill can correct solve the “Put two” task when the two objects
occur at the same receptacles. However, in the new scenario, the Planner still replicates the strategy
but fails to complete the task, as the target objects are at different receptacles.

Listing 1: An Example of Path Dependency Problem of the Planner on ALFWorld

Here is the code for a relevant skill:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see bed_1, desk_1, drawer_5, drawer_4,

drawer_3, drawer_2, drawer_1, dresser_1, and garbagecan_1.

A Trajectory of The Building Stage

Here, we present a trajectory of the Planner and the corresponding responses of the Builder for a
task in ALFWorld. In this “Indirect Success” trajectory, the Planner made the mistake of heating the
mug without having it next to the microwave. The Planner then corrected the mistake and provided
organized code in its conclusion. After observing this trajectory, the Builder keenly found the cause
of the error: the existing “Success Process” rule did not indicate that the agent must go to the object
before interacting with the object. The Builder updated the “Success Process” rule and added a
“Corrected Error” rule to clarify the mistake.

Listing 2: A Trajectory of the Planner and Builder on ALFWorld

Initial observation and the task:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see cabinet_13, cabinet_12, cabinet_11,

cabinet_10, cabinet_9, cabinet_8, cabinet_7, cabinet_6, cabinet_5, cabinet_4, cabinet_3, cabinet_2,
cabinet_1, coffeemachine_1, countertop_1, diningtable_1, drawer_1, fridge_1, garbagecan_1, microwave_1,
shelf_3, shelf_2, shelf_1, sinkbasin_1, stoveburner_4, stoveburner_3, stoveburner_2, stoveburner_1, and
toaster_1.
Your task is to: heat some mug and put it in cabinet.

Planner:
### Understanding of the observation:
The agent is in a room with numerous cabinets, appliances, and surfaces. The task is to heat a mug and

then place it in a cabinet. This requires finding a mug, heating it, and then placing it in any cabinet.

### Rules to consider:
- **rule_0**: Ensure all receptacles and surfaces are considered when searching for the mug.
- **rule_1**: Use the ’find_object’ method to search for the mug.
- **rule_2**: After finding the mug, heat it and then put it in a cabinet.
- **rule_3**: Open closed receptacles to search for objects.

### Plan for the task:
1. Use the ’find_object’ method to search for a mug in all receptacles and surfaces.
2. Once the mug is found, take it.

Execution error:

Error in [Step 4]:
I cannot heat mug_1 with microwave_1.
Current state: You are at shelf_1 and holding mug_1.

Planner’s replanning:
### Understanding of the current observations:
The agent successfully found a mug on shelf_1 and took it. However, when attempting to heat the mug with

the microwave, the action failed with "Nothing happens." This indicates that the agent tried to use the
microwave while not being at the microwave’s location. The agent must go to the microwave before
attempting to heat the mug.

### Mistakes in the previous code and the reason for errors:
The error occurred because the agent attempted to heat the mug without being at the microwave’s location.

The precondition for heating an object with a receptacle is that the agent must be at the same location
as the receptacle.

### Rules to consider:
- **rule_0**: Ensure all receptacles and surfaces are considered when searching for the mug.
- **rule_1**: Use the ’find_object’ method to search for the mug.
- **rule_2**: After finding the mug, heat it and then put it in a cabinet.
- **rule_3**: Open closed receptacles to search for objects.

### Plan for the task:
1. Since the mug has already been found and is being held by the agent, proceed to the microwave.
2. Open the microwave if it is closed.
3. Heat the mug with the microwave.

Current state: You are at cabinet_1 and holding nothing.

Planner’s conclusion:
### Summary of misunderstandings and mistakes:
Initially, I attempted to heat the mug without being at the microwave’s location, which is why the action

failed with "Nothing happens." The correct procedure is to first go to the microwave before attempting to

heat any object. After correcting this mistake, the agent successfully heated the mug and placed it in
cabinet_1.

Builder’s classification:
Analyzing the scenario, we can identify the root cause of the observed mistakes and relate them to the

existing rules:

1. The agent initially attempted to heat the mug without being at the microwave’s location, which resulted

in the action "Nothing happens." This mistake was due to the agent not following the precondition for
the ‘heat_with‘ action, which requires the agent to be at the same location as the receptacle (in this
case, the microwave).

2. The existing rules related to the mistakes are:

- **rule_1**: This rule provides a ’find_object’ method to search for objects, which the agent used

correctly to find the mug.
- **rule_2**: This ’Success Process’ rule outlines the steps to put an object in a receptacle after

finding and manipulating it. However, it does not explicitly state that the agent must be at the
location of the appliance to use it, which is relevant for the heating step.
- **rule_3**: This rule reminds the agent to open closed receptacles to search for objects, which the

agent did correctly.

3. There is a ’Success Process’ rule applicable to this type of task (rule_2), but it does not explicitly

cover the precondition for heating an object, which is to be at the same location as the appliance.

4.
The fault in this scenario can be attributed to:

*Imperfect Rules*:
The existing ’Success Process’ rule (rule_2) does not fully document the

precondition for using appliances, such as the microwave.
It does not state that the agent must be at

the location of the appliance to use it for heating an object.

Based on the analysis, the conclusion is that the fault stems from *Imperfect Rules*. The rules need to be

updated to include the precondition for using appliances, which is a critical step in the ’Success
Process’ for tasks involving heating objects.
Builder:
Potential Rules:
1. *Corrected Error*: When attempting to use an appliance (e.g., microwave), the agent must be at the same

location as the appliance. This rule is related to the existing ’Success Process’ rule (rule_2), but it
adds a specific precondition for using appliances that was not previously documented.

25


---Page Break---
2. *Success Process*: The existing ’Success Process’ rule (rule_2) should be updated to include the

precondition of being at the location of the appliance before using it. This is a critical step in tasks
involving heating objects.

Check Difference:
- The potential ’Corrected Error’ rule targets the specific precondition for using appliances, which is a

new addition and not covered by existing rules.
- The update to the ’Success Process’ rule expands on the existing steps to include the precondition for

using appliances, which is a refinement of the existing rule.

Check Existing Rules:
- Rule_2 needs to be updated to include the precondition for using appliances, as this was the key

oversight that led to the agent’s initial error.

[Response Instructions]
You will be given rules discovered by colleagues, summarizing game mechanisms and

experiences of success and failure. Use these rules to guide your coding efforts.

27


---Page Break---
Aim to understand and apply the principles behind the examples of these rules,
adapting them to fit your specific scenarios within the simulated environment.

Output Format Instructions:
1. First, explain your understanding of the task and the current observations, then

describe rules (with their IDs) that need to be considered and plan for the task.
Then, write your code between "‘‘‘python" and "‘‘‘". No text should follow after
the code block.
2. After receiving feedback, you should also explain your understanding of the

current observations, including special (unexpected) formats or phenomena, mistakes

in your previous code, and the reasons for errors. Then, describe rules (with
their IDs) that need to be considered, plan for the task, and then write code.

Follow these instructions:
1. DO NOT USE an undefined function or attribute of the agent. Your code must be

directly executable in the given environment. I won’t implement any placeholders in

your code for you.
2. Your code should be consistent with the code examples of the rules (please copy

the code if there is no better modification!), making it easier for the builder
agent to refine and develop new rules effectively.
3. In your code, you are encouraged to define helpful functions, which should be

general and reusable in different scenes. The helper methods in the rules are
already defined in the coding environment, so you can directly use them. If you don
’t need to modify them, don’t redefine them.
4. After defining helper methods, your code should be divided into steps (marked

with "[Step]" in comments) and write assertions at the end of each step to ensure
that each step achieves its subgoal.
Follow these instructions. Don’t give up or change the task.

Listing 4: Conclusion Prompt for Indirect Success

Please summarize the misunderstandings and mistakes you made, and then organize your

code into a code block. You should copy the used parts from your previous code,
including helper methods and steps. You can only modify the previously wrong step,
and make sure you don’t miss any detail! So that I can use it with similar but not
the same scenarios.

Listing 5: Conclusion Prompt for Failure

You failed to complete the task. Now carefully review the trajectory of the executed

actions and the corresponding observations, then identify the reasons for the
failure. This reason is often your mistake or misunderstanding rather than the
environment’s error. By carefully comparing with applicable rules and examples,
pinpoint where your code deviated from expected standards.

If there exist coding errors, specify the segments of the problematic code and

elucidate how they contributed to the errors. If you want to write a correction for

an error, you must double-check its plausibility! Additionally, determine whether
your codes were in strict adherence to the relevant rules and examples. This
reflection and documentation will serve as a reminder for completing future tasks.

Prompts for Builder Agent

Listing 11: System Prompts for The Builder Agent

[Role]
You are observing a housekeeper agent as it codes and acts within a simulated

environment (game). Your Role is to construct a manual of rules to not only assist
the agent in completing tasks but also to do so with the least amount of attempts/
errors. This requires recording and analyzing the experiences of the agent’s
successes and failures, and updating previous discoveries.

[Functions]
You will be presented with the current epoch’s trajectory. The interaction in the

trajectory includes the agent’s analysis, execution code, and the resulting
feedback.

You should use the following methods of rule_system to build and improve rules.

rule_system.write_rule(rule, type="", example="", validation_record="")
# Write down a new rule of the game you discovered.
# Parameters:
#
rule: a rule of the game you discovered.
#
type: the type of the rule, chosen from ["Special Phenomena/Mechanism", "
Corrected Error", "Unresolved Error", "Useful Helper Method", "Success Process"].
The "Corrected Error" can include misunderstandings and mistakes that have been
corrected.
#
example: an example (or code) from the trajectory demonstrates this rule. You
can add detailed information in the comment.
#
validation_record: your validation record on this rule, including the epoch IDs
and rule IDs from which this rule is induced.

rule_system.update_rule(rule_id, rule="", type="", example="", validation_record="")

,
# Rewrite the attributes of an existing rule when you come up with a better

understanding.
# Input only the attributes you want to rewrite.

rule_system.stop_generating()
# Description: stop generating rules from the current epoch.
# Use Case: When you believe that the trajectory of the current epoch is not needed

or insufficient to derive any more new rules, you can call this function and wait
for the next epoch’s data. You should also call this function when you have updated

all rules for the current epoch.

[Actions]
At each epoch, an agent is created in an environment, and the initial observation

and target task are printed. The agent can only use the following action functions:

agent.go_to(receptacle) # Go to a receptacle and update the agent’s location.
agent.open(receptacle) # Open a receptacle and observe its contents.
agent.close(receptacle) # Close a opened receptacle.
agent.take_from(object, receptacle) # Take an object from a receptacle if the agent

is not holding anything.
agent.put_in_or_on(object, receptacle) # Put an object in or on a receptacle if the

agent is holding it.
agent.use(object) # Use a lamp.
agent.clean_with(object, receptacle) # Clean an object with a receptacle.
agent.heat_with(object, receptacle) # Heat an object with a receptacle.
agent.cool_with(object, receptacle) # Cool an object with a receptacle.

32

get_object_with_id(observation, object_name) # Extracts a list of object_ids with

the specified object_name from the observation.

[Response Instructions]
Upon receiving the current trajectory, you should first identify the case of the

current trajectory’s result and then build rules following the corresponding
instructions.

Listing 12: Case Classify Prompts for Builder

Please analyze the scenario to identify the root cause of the observed mistakes and

describe the existing rules related to the mistakes. Then check whether there
exists a "Success Process" rule applicable to this type of task. Finally, determine

whether the fault stems from:
- *Imperfect Rules*: the agent encounters unexpected phenomena that are not fully

documented in the current rules, or the rules have not included the "Success
Process" of this task type.
- *Imperfect Agent*: the rules fully document the "Success Process" and error

reminders of such scenarios, but the agent fails to follow these rules meticulously
.
Consider each step of the process carefully and conclude with either *Imperfect

Rules* or *Imperfect Agent* based on your analysis.

Listing 13: Base Prompts for Builder

[Output Format Instructions]
Based on the current trajectory and your analysis, you should output the following

things:
* Potential Rules: Describe your thoughts about potential rules based on the current
trajectory. Depending on the results, you may need to check *Success Process*, *
Helper Method*, *Corrected Error*, *Unresolved Error*, and other findings in
sequence. Each potential rule needs to be clarified whether it is related to
existing rules.
* Check Difference: Describe whether the potential rules target different phenomena.
* Check Existing Rules: Describe whether existing rules are conflicted or need
updating.
* Codes: Finally, sequentially call the rule_system’s functions within "‘‘‘python"
and "‘‘‘".

[Detailed instructions]
**Maintain a maximum of 12 rules** Try to make each rule useful and non-repetitive,
and insert new rules into closely related ones.
**Add Rules** Extract "Special Phenomena/Mechanism" rules when interactions appear
counterintuitive, environment-specific, or when the agent expresses uncertainty
about the environment mechanics (e.g., using "assume..." in the comment). Refrain
from making speculative suggestions or guesses. Instead, conservatively document
phenomena and the agent’s valuable insights.
**Keep new rules targeted and precise.** Break down a large phenomenon or general
strategy into targeted units as individual rules. These can later be upgraded or
merged into a more general or larger rule.
**Write rules’ scope** The time when the rule is triggered, or the task scope of the
rule should be mentioned at the beginning of the rule.
**Avoiding overconfidence for new rules** Please acknowledge the need for further
verification in your note.

**Update Rules** If an existing rule needs to be updated to include a new phenomenon
, you should try to preserve the details of the existing content and preferably
insert a categorial discussion or just insert new content into it (or its example).

Especially, the rules of "Success Process" and "Useful Helper Method" type should
retain their details. Then update the rule’s validation_record after further
verification or revision.

Listing 14: Case 1 Prompts for Builder

---Page Break---
**Rules for Success** You should extract "Useful Helper Method" and "Success Process
":
* For each useful helper function identified: If it is not already included in a
rule, create a rule of type "Useful Helper Method" and record its code unchanged in

the rule’s example section. If a method with similar functionality already exists
in the rule, consider whether the rule needs to be updated.
* If the success process does not fall within the scope of an existing "Success
Process" rule, faithfully document all steps (marked as "[Step]") in the successful

code within a rule of type "Success Process", and document necessary codes and
reminders in the rule’s example; if the success process of the current task falls
within the scope of the existing "Success Process" rule, consider whether the rule
needs to be updated to incorporate the current roadmap.

Listing 15: Case 2 Prompts for Builder

**Rules for Success** You should extract "Useful Helper Method" and "Success Process

code within a rule of type "Success Process", and document necessary codes and
reminders in the rule’s example; if the success process of the current task falls
within the scope of the existing "Success Process" rule, consider whether the rule
needs to be updated to incorporate the current roadmap.

**Rules for Misstep** You should reflect on the main misstep to improve efficiency
and log it into the "Corrected Error" type rule, including corrective code
validated by the feedback (with the help of the agent’s analysis and code, but its
conclusion may not be correct and should be checked carefully).

Listing 16: Case 3 Prompts for Builder

**Rules for Success** You might need to update "Useful Helper Method" and "Success
Process".
* For each useful helper method identified: If a method with similar functionality
already exists in the rule, consider whether the rule needs to be updated.
* If the success process of the current task falls within the scope of the existing
"Success Process" rule, consider whether you need to update the rule to include
some tips or include important and specific code in its examples.

**Rules for Misstep** Identify existing rules that agents failed to follow and
resulted in major mistakes. You should update the rule to emphasize some important
points (you can add **...** at the part of the rule you want to emphasize) or to
add error-prone points (perhaps added to the comments of the example code).

Listing 17: Case 4 Prompts for Builder

**Rules for Final Error** Based on your previous analysis and conclusion, summarize
the final error that led to failure. You should write an "Unresolved Error" rule to

record the error: in what situation, what the agent did, and what results were
produced. So that they can serve as reminders for the agent in the future. Please
don’t rush to propose any definitive reasons or suggestions for the error; just
record it.

The final error is unresolved and cannot be included in rules of other types than "

Unresolved Error". As the task failed, you cannot write down any "Success Process"
or "Useful Helper Method" rules.

Prompts for Consolidator Agent

Listing 19: System Prompts for Consolidator

[Role]
You are observing a housekeeper agent as it codes and acts within a simulated

environment (game). Your goal is to construct a manual of rules to assist the agent

in completing various tasks in the environment. Your Role is to merge or delete
previously found rules by analyzing the experiences of the agent.

[Functions]
You will be presented with the current found rules. The rules are extracted from

many epochs’ trajectories, in which each interaction includes the agent’s analysis,

execution code, and the resulting feedback.

A rule is represented with ’rule_id’ and has the following attributes:

- rule: the description of the rule, which begins with its use case or scope.
- type: the type of the rule.
- example: an example (or code) from the trajectory demonstrates this rule. You

can add detailed information in the comment.
- validation_record: your validation record on this rule, including the epoch IDs

and rule IDs from which this rule is induced.

You should use the following methods of rule_system to delete and merge rules.

rule_system.update_rule(rule_id, rule="", type="", example="", validation_record="")
# Rewrite the attributes of an existing rule when you come up with a better

understanding.
# Input only the attributes you want to rewrite.

rule_system.delete_rule(rule_id)
# Delete a existing rule with rule_id.
# **How to merge** To merge two existing rules, you can call rule_system.update_rule

for one rule and then call rule_system.delete_rule to delete another rule.

rule_system.get_interactions(epoch_ids)
# Get the interaction history of previous epochs by their IDs.
# Use Case: You can use this tool to get the interactions from previous epochs (

epoch starts from 0). You may need to check the validation_record of an existing
rule to know which epochs to get.
# Parameters:
#
epoch_ids: a string containing the epoch IDs from previous epochs, separated by
commas, e.g., epoch_0,epoch2.

rule_system.stop_generating()
# Description: stop generating rules from the current epoch.
# Use Case: You should call this function when you have finished updating all rules

for the current epoch.

[Actions]
At each epoch, an agent is created in an environment. The agent can only use the

following action functions in its code to interact with the environment:

agent.go_to(receptacle) # Go to a receptacle and update the agent’s location.
agent.open(receptacle) # Open a receptacle and observe its contents.

35


---Page Break---
agent.close(receptacle) # Close a opened receptacle.

agent.heat_with(object, receptacle) # Heat an object with a receptacle.
agent.cool_with(object, receptacle) # Cool an object with a receptacle.
get_object_with_id(observation, object_name) # Extracts a list of object_ids with

the specified object_name from the observation.

[Response Instructions]
Output Process:
After receiving the current rules, you should select potential rules to investigate

and then delete or merge rules.

Detailed instructions:
**Maintain a maximum of 12 rules**
**Merge if addressed** If a "Success Process" rule can address the "Corrected Error"
or "Unresolved Error" rule, you can consider merging these rules while retaining
their details.

**Retain important details** The rules of "Success Process" and "Useful Helper
Method" type should retain their details, and should not be deleted or easily
refreshed by new updates. You cannot merge two rules of type "Success Process" or "
Useful Helper Method"!
**Insertion is preferable** If a rule is updated to include the content of other
rules, you should try to preserve the details of the existing content and
preferably insert a categorial discussion or insert new content to it (or its
example).

Prompts for Formulator Agent

Listing 20: System Prompts for Formulator

[Role]
You are observing a housekeeper agent as it codes and acts within a simulated

environment (game). Your goal is to construct a manual of rules to assist the agent

in completing various tasks in the environment. Your role is to formulate a manual
based on the found rules, including categorizing and summarizing related rules.

[Functions]
You will be presented with the current found rules. The rules are extracted from

many epochs’ trajectories, in which each interaction includes the agent’s analysis,

execution code, and the resulting feedback.

A rule is represented with ’rule_id’ and has the following attributes:

- rule: the description of the rule, which begins with its use case or scope.
- type: the type of the rule.
- example: an example (or code) from the trajectory demonstrates this rule. You

[Response Instructions]
Output Process:
After receiving the current rules, you should output the following things:
* General Understandings: Describe your overall understanding of all rules and some
specific rules.
* Category of Rules: Methodically analyze the connections between related rules,
then cluster these rules, and propose category names for the clusters. Make sure
each rule must belong to one and only one category!
* The Manual: Finally, sequentially write a structured manual within ’‘‘‘markdown’
and ’‘‘‘’. In the manual, you first describe the overview of all rules and then
introduce each category of rules. In each category, you should list the rules and
write rule_id within ** and **.

Detailed instructions:
1. Categorize rules based on their use cases and topics they target, not based on

their "type".
2. If two "Success Process" rules follow the same critical success points or process

, you can consider categorizing them into one category and propose a general
strategy with the critical success points in the Introduction section of the
category. But you don’t have to do this if they don’t follow the same critical
success points.
3. To make the manual more accessible, please make the categories and rules appear

in order from easy to difficult and from basic to complex.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1352

1. Claims
1353

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
1354

paper’s contributions and scope?
1355

Answer: [Yes]
1356

Justiﬁcation: As shown in the Section of Experiments, our methods require little human
1357

expert knowledge of the new environment and can resolve the path dependency problem.
1358

Guidelines:
1359

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
1360

made in the paper.
1361

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
1362

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
1363

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
1364

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how
1365

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
1366

• It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
1367

are not attained by the paper.
1368

2. Limitations
1369

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
1370

Answer: [Yes]
1371

Justiﬁcation: See Limitation Section.
1372

Guidelines:
1373

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
1374

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
1375

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
1376

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
1377

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
1378

model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
1379

should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
1380

implications would be.
1381

• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
1382

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
1383

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
1384

• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
1385

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
1386

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
1387

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
1388

technical jargon.
1389

• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
1390

and how they scale with dataset size.
1391

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
1392

address problems of privacy and fairness.
1393

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
1394

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
1395

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
1396

judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
1397

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
1398

will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
1399

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
1400

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
1401

a complete (and correct) proof?
1402

Answer: [NA]
1403

37


---Page Break---
Justiﬁcation: The paper includes no theoretical results.
1404

Guidelines:
1405

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
1406

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
1407

referenced.
1408

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
1409

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
1410

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
1411

proof sketch to provide intuition.
1412

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
1413

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
1414

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
1415

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
1416

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
1417

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
1418

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
1419

Answer: [Yes]
1420

Justiﬁcation: We describe the implementation details in the section of Experiments and
1421

Appendix.
1422

Guidelines:
1423

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1424

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
1425

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
1426

whether the code and data are provided or not.
1427

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
1428

to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
1429

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
1430

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
1431

might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may
1432

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
1433

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
1434

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
1435

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
1436

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
1437

appropriate to the research performed.
1438

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
1439

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
1440

nature of the contribution. For example
1441

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
1442

to reproduce that algorithm.
1443

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
1444

the architecture clearly and fully.
1445

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
1446

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
1447

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
1448

the dataset).
1449

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
1450

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
1451

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
1452

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
1453

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
1454

5. Open access to data and code
1455

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
1456

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
1457

material?
1458

38


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
1459

Justiﬁcation: We have provided the prompts and examples in the Appendix. We have
1460

provided the source code.
1461

Guidelines:
1462

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
1463

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
1464

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
1465

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
1466

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
1467

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
1468

benchmark).
1469

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
1470

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
1471

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
1472

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
1473

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
1474

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
1475

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
1476

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
1477

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
1478

versions (if applicable).
1479

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
1480

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
1481

6. Experimental Setting/Details
1482

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
1483

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
1484

results?
1485

Answer: [Yes]
1486

Justiﬁcation: We have described these in the experiments
1487

Guidelines:
1488

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1489

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
1490

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
1491

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
1492

material.
1493

7. Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance
1494

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropriate
1495

information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?
1496

Answer: [Yes]
1497

Justiﬁcation: We performed each experiment 3 times and have shown the error bar (standard
1498

deviations).
1499

Guidelines:
1500

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1501

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁ-
1502

dence intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support
1503

the main claims of the paper.
1504

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
1505

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
1506

run with given experimental conditions).
1507

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
1508

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
1509

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
1510

---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
1511

of the mean.
1512

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
1513

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
1514

of Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.
1515

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
1516

ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
1517

error rates).
1518

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
1519

they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.
1520

8. Experiments Compute Resources
1521

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
1522

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
1523

the experiments?
1524

Answer: [Yes]
1525

Justiﬁcation: We use the OpenAI API for all experiments and report the cost.
1526

Guidelines:
1527

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
1528

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
1529

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
1530

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
1531

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
1532

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
1533

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
1534

didn’t make it into the paper).
1535

9. Code Of Ethics
1536

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
1537

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
1538

Answer: [Yes]
1539

Justiﬁcation: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
1540

Guidelines:
1541

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
1542

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
1543

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
1544

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
1545

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
1546

10. Broader Impacts
1547

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
1548

societal impacts of the work performed?
1549

Answer: [Yes]
1550

Justiﬁcation: See Broader Impacts Section.
1551

Guidelines:
1552

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
1553

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
1554

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
1555

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
1556

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
1557

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc
1558

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
1559

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
1560

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
1561

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
1562

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
1563

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
1564

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
1565

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
1566

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
1567

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
1568

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
1569

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
1570

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
1571

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
1572

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
1573

feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).
1574

11. Safeguards
1575

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
1576

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
1577

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
1578

Answer: [NA]
1579

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not provide pretrained language models, image generators, or
1580

scraped datasets.
1581

Guidelines:
1582

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
1583

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
1584

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
1585

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
1586

safety ﬁlters.
1587

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
1588

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
1589

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
1590

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
1591

faith effort.
1592

12. Licenses for existing assets
1593

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
1594

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
1595

properly respected?
1596

Answer: [Yes]
1597

Justiﬁcation: We have stated and cited the asset used in the paper.
1598

Guidelines:
1599

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
1600

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
1601

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
1602

URL.
1603

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
1604

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
1605

service of that source should be provided.
1606

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
1607

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
1608

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
1609

license of a dataset.
1610

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
1611

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
1612

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
1613

the asset’s creators.
1614

13. New Assets
1615

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
1616

provided alongside the assets?
1617

Answer: [NA]
1618

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not release new assets.
1619

Guidelines:
1620

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
1621

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their

1625

asset is used.
1626

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
1627

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.
1628

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
1629

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
1630

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
1631

well as details about compensation (if any)?
1632

Answer: [NA]
1633

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
1634

Guidelines:
1635

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
1636

human subjects.
1637

• Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contribu-
1638

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
1639

included in the main paper.
1640

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
1641

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
1642

collector.
1643

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
1644

Subjects
1645

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
1646

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
1647

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
1648

institution) were obtained?
1649

Answer: [NA]
1650

Justiﬁcation: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
1651

Guidelines:
1652

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
1653

human subjects.
1654

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
1655

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
1656

should clearly state this in the paper.
1657

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary signiﬁcantly between institutions
1658

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
1659

guidelines for their institution.
1660

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
1661

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
