Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task,
aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving per-
formance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This prob-
lem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly
enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models,
making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new
sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models
must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks
but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep (Continual Audio-Visual Sound
Separation). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation
Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through in-
cremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in
old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seam-
lessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation
frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate
catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared
to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation. Code is

Introduction

Humans can effortlessly separate and identify individual sound sources in daily experience [25, 7, 64,
33]. This skill plays a crucial role in our ability to understand and interact with the complex auditory
environments that surround us [34]. However, replicating this capability in machines remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of real-world auditory scenes [7, 77]. Inspired by
the multisensory perception of humans [62, 60], audio-visual sound separation tackles this challenge
by utilizing visual information to guide the separation of individual sound sources in an audio mixture.

Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in audio-visual sound separation [84,
23, 21, 67, 14, 65, 81, 63, 11, 71]. Benefiting from more advanced architectures (e.g., U-Net [84, 23],
Transformer [14], and diffusion models [27]) and discriminative visual cues (e.g., grounded visual
objects [67], motion [83], and dynamic gestures [21]), audio-visual separation models are able to
separate sounds ranging from domain-specific speech, musical instrument sounds to open-domain
general sounds within training sound categories. However, a limitation of these studies is their focus
on scenarios where all sound source classes are presently known, overlooking the potential inclusion
of unknown sound source classes during inference in real-world applications. This oversight leads to
the catastrophic forgetting issue [32, 3], where the fine-tuning of models on new classes detrimentally
impacts their performance on previously learned classes. Despite Chen et al. [14] demonstrating
that their iQuery model can generalize to new classes well through simple fine-tuning, it still suffers
from the catastrophic forgetting problem on old classes. This prevents the trained models from

continuously updating in real-world scenarios, impeding their adaptability to dynamic environments.
The question how to effectively leverage visual guidance to continuously separate sounds from new
categories while preserving separation ability for old sound categories remains open.

continual audio-visual sound separation and its mitigation

To bridge this gap, we introduce a
novel continual audio-visual sound
separation task by integrating audio-
visual sound separation with contin-
ual learning principles. The goal of
this task is to develop an audio-visual
model that can continuously separate
sound sources in new classes while
maintaining performance on previously
learned classes.
The key challenge
we need to address is catastrophic for-
getting during continual audio-visual
learning, which occurs when the model
is updated solely with data from new
classes or tasks, resulting in a signifi-
cant performance drop on old ones. We
illustrate our new task and the catas-
trophic forgetting issue in Fig. 1.

Unlike typical continual learning prob-
lems such as task-, domain-, or class-
incremental classification in visual do-
mains [2, 57, 38, 53, 85], which result
in progressively increasing logits (or
probability distribution) across all ob-
served classes at each incremental step, our task uniquely produces fixed-size separation masks
throughout all incremental steps. In this context, each entry in the mask does not directly correspond
to any specific classes. Additionally, the new task involves both audio and visual modalities. There-
fore, simply applying existing visual-only methods cannot fully exploit and preserve the inherent
cross-modal semantic correlations. Very recently, Pian et al. [53] and Mo et al. [44] extended
continual learning to the audio-visual domain, but both focused on classification tasks.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep
(Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation). Upon the framework, we introduce a novel Cross-modal
Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to not only maintain the cross-modal semantic similar-
ity through incremental tasks but also preserve previously learned knowledge of semantic similarity
in old models to counter catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC is a generic constraint that can be
seamlessly integrated into the training process of different audio-visual sound separators. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed ContAV-Sep, we conducted experiments on the MUSIC-21 dataset
within the framework of continual learning, using the state-of-the-art audio-visual sound separation
model iQuery [14] and a representative audio-visual sound separation model Co-Separation [23],
as our separation base models. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate
catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance than other continual learning
baselines. In summary, this paper contributes follows:

(i) To explore more practical audio-visual sound separation, in which the separation model should
be generalized to new sound source classes continually, we pose a Continual Audio-Visual Sound
Separation task that trains the separation model under the setting of continual learning. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work on continual learning for audio-visual sound separation.

(ii) We propose ContAV-Sep for the new task. It uses a novel cross-modal similarity distillation
constraint to preserve cross-modal semantic similarity knowledge from previously learned models.

(iii) Experiments on the MUSIC-21 dataset can validate the effectiveness of our ContAV-Sep, demon-
strating promising performance gain over baselines.

Related Work

Audio-Visual Sound Separation. Audio-visual sound separation aims to separate individual sound
sources from an audio mixture guided by visual cues. A line of research emerges under various
scenarios, such as separating musical instruments [23, 84, 79, 21, 83, 67], human speech [20, 1,
18, 49, 15], or sound sources in in-the-wild videos [22, 70]. Many frameworks and methods have
been proposed to address challenges within specific problem settings. For instance, the extraction of
face embeddings proves beneficial for speech audio separation [18]. Moreover, incorporating object
detection can provide an additional advantage [23, 22]. The utilization of trajectory optical flows to
leverage temporal motion information in videos, as demonstrated by [83], also yields improvements.
In this work, not competing on designing stronger separators, we would advance the exploration of
the audio-visual sound separation within the paradigm of continual learning. We investigate how
a model can learn to consistently separate sound sources from sequential separation tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge.

Continual Learning. The field of continual learning has drawn significant attention, especially
in visual domains, with various approaches addressing this challenge. Notable among these are
regularization-based methods, exemplified in works such as [32, 3, 31, 39]. These approaches involve
applying regularization to crucial parameters associated with old tasks to maintain the model’s
capabilities and during incremental steps, less important parameters are given higher priority for
updates compared to important ones. Conversely, several works [57, 9, 5, 26, 12, 54, 8, 10, 40] applied
rehearsal-based pipelines to enable the model review previously learned knowledge. For instance,
Rebuffi et al. [57] proposed one of the most representative exemplars selection strategy Nearest-Mean-
of-Exemplars (NME), selects the most representative exemplars in each class based on the distance
to the feature center of the class. Meanwhile, pseudo-rehearsal [47, 48, 66] employs generative
models to create pseudo-exemplars based on the estimated distribution of data from previous classes.
Moreover, architecture-based/dynamic architecture methods[52, 4, 46, 24, 28, 37, 40] proposed to
modify the model architecture itself to enable the model to acquire new knowledge while mitigating
the forgetting of old knowledge. Specifically, Pham et al. [52] proposed a dual network architecture, in
which one is to learn new tasks while the other one is for retaining knowledge learned from old tasks.
Wang et al. [72] combined the dynamic architecture and distillation constraint to mitigate the issue
of continual-increasing overhead problem in dynamic architecture-based continual learning method.
However, above studies mainly concentrate on the area of continual image classification. Recently,
researchers also explored other continual learning scenarios beyond image classification. For instance,
Park et al. [50] extend the knowledge distillation-based [2, 17] continual image classification method
to the domain of video by proposing the time-channel distillation constraint. Douillard et al. [16]
proposed to tackle the continual semantic segmentation task with multi-view feature distillation and
pseudo-labeling. Xiao et al. [78] further addressed the continual semantic segmentation problem
through weights fusion strategy between old and current models. Wang et al. [75] addressed the
continual sound classification task through generative replay. Furthermore, continual learning has
also been explored in the domain of language/vision-language learning tasks [30, 43, 59, 61, 19, 86],
self-supervised representation learning [19, 42, 55, 80, 35, 74], audio classification [6, 73] and
fake audio detection [41, 82], etc. Despite the success of existing continual learning methods in
various scenarios, their applicability in the domain of continual audio-visual sound separation is
still unexplored. Although Pian et al. [53] and Mo et al. [44] proposed to tackle the catastrophic
problem in audio-visual learning, their studies mainly concentrated in the area of audio-visual video
classification. In contrast to existing works in continual learning, in this paper, we delves into the
continual audio-visual sound separation, aiming to tackle the challenge of catastrophic forgetting
specifically in the context of separation mask prediction for complicated mixed audio signals within
joint audio-visual modeling.

Problem Formulation

Audio-Visual Sound Separation. Audio-visual sound separation aims to separate distinctive sound
signals according to the given associated visual guidance. Following previous works [14, 23, 67,
21, 79], we adopt the common “mix-and-separation” training strategy to train the model. Given two
videos V 1(s1, v1) and V 2(s2, v2), we can obtain the input mixed sound signal S by mixing two

3


---Page Break---
video sound signals s1 and s2, and then we can have the ratio masks M 1 = s1/S and M 2 = s2/S1.
The goal of the task is to utilize the corresponding visual guidance v1 and v2 to predict the ratio
masks for reconstructing the two individual audio signals. This process can be formulated as:

ˆ
M
1 = FΘ(S, v1),

ˆ
M
2 = FΘ(S, v2),
(1)

where FΘ is the separation model with trainable parameters Θ. And then, the original sound signals
s1 and s2 are used to calculate the loss function for optimizing the model:

Θ∗= argmin

E(V 1,V 2)∼D
h
L( ˆ
M
1, M 1) + L( ˆ
M
2, M 2)
i

(2)

where D denotes the training set, and L is the loss function between the prediction and ground-truth.

Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation. Our proposed continual audio-visual sound separation
task aims to train a model FΘ continually on a sequence of T separation tasks {T1, T2, ..., TT }. For
the t-th task Tt (incremental step t), we have a training set Dt = {V i(si, vi), yi
t}nt
i=1, where i and nt
denote the i-th video sample and the total number of samples in Dt respectively, and yi
t ∈Ct is the
corresponding sound source class of video V i, where Ct is the training sound class label space of task
Tt. For any two tasks Tt1 and Tt2 and their corresponding training sound class label space Ct1 and
Ct2, we have Ct1 ∩Ct2 = ∅. Following previous works in continual learning [57, 2, 53, 44, 29, 76],
for a task Tt, where t > 1, holding a small size of memory/exemplar set Mt to store some data from
old tasks is permitted in our setting. Therefore, with the memory/exemplar set Mt, all available data
that can be used for training in task Tt (t > 1) can be denoted as D′
t = Dt ∪Mt. Finally, the training
process of Eq. 2 in our continual audio-visual sound separation setting can be denoted as:

Θt = argmin
Θt−1
E(V 1,V 2)∼D′
t
h
L( ˆ
M
1, M 1) + L( ˆ

i
,

s.t.
ˆ
M
1 = FΘt−1(S, v1),
ˆ
M
2 = FΘt−1(S, v2),
(3)

which means that the new model Θt is obtained by updating the old model Θt−1 which was trained
on the previous task, using the current task’s available data D′
t. After the training process for task
Tt with D′
t, the updated model will be evaluated on a testing set which includes video samples
from all seen sound source classes up to continual step t (task Tt). And the evaluation also follows
the common “mix-and-separation” strategy. During this continual learning process, the model’s
separation performance on the previously learned tasks drops significantly after training on new tasks.
This learning issue is referred to as the catastrophic forgetting [32, 38, 3] problem, which poses a
considerable challenge in continual audio-visual sound separation.

3.2
Overview

To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in continual audio-visual sound separation, we
introduce ContAV-Sep. This new framework, illustrated in Fig. 2, consists of three key components:
a separation base model, an output mask distillation module, and our proposed Cross-modal Simi-
larity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC). We use a recent state-of-the-art audio-visual separator:
iQuery [14] as the base model of our approach, which contains a video encoder to extract the global
motion feature, an object detector and image encoder to obtain the object feature, a U-Net [58]
for mixture sound encoding and separated sound decoding, and an audio-visual Transformer to get
the separated sound feature through multi-modal cross-attention mechanism and class-aware audio
queries. For the object detector, we follow iQuery [14] and use the pre-trained Detic [87], a universal
object detector, to detect the sound source objects in each frame. For the video encoder and the
image encoder, inspired by the excellent generalization ability of recent self-supervised pre-trained
models, which has been proven to be effective and appropriate in continual learning [53], we apply
two self-supervised pre-trained models VideoMAE [69] and CLIP [56] as the video encoder and the
image encoder, respectively. Note that, during the training process, the object detector, video encoder,
and image encoder are frozen.

1In practice, the audio signal is first processed using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to generate a
spectrogram. For brevity, we will denote spectrogram magnitudes as s1, s2, and S.

Please note that, the old model FΘt−1 is frozen during training.

Given a pair of videos V 1(s1, v1) and V 2(s2, v2), at incremental step t (task Tt), the U-Net audio
encoder FAE

takes the mixed audio signal S obtained by mixing s1 and s2 as input, and generates
the latent mixed audio feature. This process can be expressed as:

f lat.
t

Then, the audio-visual Transformer FT rans.

is employed to generate the separated sound feature by
taking the latent mixed audio feature and visual features as inputs:

visual signal v1 of video V 1, U o

t (·) are learnable projection layers to map the object and
motion features into the same dimension. Similarly, we can also obtain the separated sound feature of
V 2 guided by the associated visual features.

The extracted separated sound feature and the latent mixed audio feature are combined to generate
a mask. This mask is subsequently applied to the mixed audio, leading to the reconstruction of the
separated sound spectrogram.

3.3
Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint

Recent studies [53, 45] have highlighted the importance of cross-modal semantic correlation in
audio-visual modeling. However, this correlation tends to diminish during subsequent incremental
phases, which leads to catastrophic forgetting in our continual audio-visual sound separation task. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC)

5


---Page Break---
that serves two crucial purposes (1) maintaining cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental
tasks, and (2) preserving previous learned semantic similarity knowledge from old tasks.

CrossSDC preserves cross-modal semantic similarity from two perspectives: instance-aware semantic
similarity and class-aware semantic similarity. Both similarities are enforced by integrating contrastive
loss and knowledge distillation. Instead of exclusively focusing on the similarities within current
and memory data generated by the current training model, CrossSDC incorporates the cross-modal
similarity knowledge acquired from previous tasks into the contrastive loss. This integration not
only facilitates the learning of cross-modal semantic similarities in new tasks but also ensures the
preservation of previously acquired knowledge. In the incremental step t (t > 1), the instance-aware
part of our CrossSDC can be formulated as:

Linst. = −EV i∼D′
t

P



,
(7)

where 1[i = j] is an indicator that equals 1 when i = j, denoting that video samples V i and V j are
the same video; The sim function represents the cosine similarity function with temperature scaling;
The modalities mod1 and mod2, where (mod1, mod2) ∈{(a, o), (a, m), (m, o)}, denote different
pairs of features to be compared: separated sound and object features, sound and motion features,
and motion and object features. Here, τ denotes the incremental step, for which we have:

τ1, τ2 ∈T, where T =

{t, t −1},
if V ∈Mt,
{t},
if V ∈Dt,
(8)

which means that, for current task’s data Dt, we calculate the contrastive loss using features from
the current model (τ1 = τ2 = t), while for memory set data Mt, we use features from both the
old and current models (e.g., τ1 = t and τ2 = t −1). In this way, knowledge distillation would be
integrated into the cross-modal semantic similarity constraint for the current task, which ensures
better preservation of learned cross-modal semantic similarity from previous tasks.

While the instance-aware similarity provides valuable semantic correlation modeling, it does not
account for the class-level semantic correlations, which is also crucial for audio-visual similarity
modeling. To capture and preserve the semantic similarity within each class across incremental
tasks, we also incorporate a class-aware component specifically designed for inter-class cross-modal
semantic similarity, which can be formulated as:

Lcls. = −E(V i,yi)∼D′
t



P

k exp(sim(f mod1
τ1,i , f mod2
τ2,k ))



. (9)

In this context, visual and audio features from two videos are encouraged to be close when they
belong to the same class. The overall formulation of our CrossSDC is as follows:

LCrossSDC = λinsLins + λclsLcls,
(10)

where λins and λcls are two scalars that balance the two loss terms. In this way, the model captures
and preserves semantic correlations not just between instances but also within the same classes.

3.4
Overall Loss Function

In the previous subsection, we introduced our proposed CrossSDC constraint. To effectively combine
CrossSDC with the overall objective, we incorporate it alongside output distillation and the main
separation loss function.

Output distillation is a widely used technique in continual learning [38, 2, 53] to preserve the
knowledge gained from previous tasks while learning new ones. In our approach, we utilize the
output of the old model as the distillation target to preserve this knowledge. Note that we only distill
knowledge for data from the memory set, as represented by:

Finally, our overall loss function is denoted as:

3.5
Management of Memory Set

In alignment with the work of [76], our framework maintains a compact memory set throughout
incremental updates. Each old class is limited to a maximum number of exemplars. After completing
training for each task, we adopt the exemplar selection strategies in [2, 53] by randomly selecting
exemplars for each current class and combining these new exemplars with the existing memory set.

Experiments

In this section, we first introduce the setup of our experiments, i.e., dataset, baselines, evaluation
metrics, and the implementation details. After that, we present the experimental results of our
ContAV-Sep compared to the baselines, as well as ablation studies. We also conduct experiments on
the AVE [68] and the VGGSound [13] datasets, which contain sound categories beyond the music
domain. We put the experimental results on the AVE and the VGGSound datasets, the comparison to
the uni-modal semantic similarity preservation method, the performance evaluation on old classes in
incremental tasks, and the visualization of separating results in the Appendix.

4.1
Experimental Setup

Dataset. Following common practice [83, 88, 14], we conducted experiments on MUSIC-21 [83],
which contains solo videos of 21 instruments categories: accordion, acoustic guitar, cello, clarinet,
erhu, flute, saxophone, trumpet, tuba, violin, xylophone, bagpipe, banjo, bassoon, congas, drum,
electric, bass, guzheng, piano, pipa, and ukulele. In our experiments, we randomly selected 20 of
them to construct the continual learning setting. Specifically, we split the selected 20 classes into 4
incremental tasks, each of which involves 5 classes. The total number of available videos is 1040,
and we randomly split them into training, validation, and testing sets with 840, 100, and 100 videos,
respectively. To further validate the efficacy of our method across a broader sound domain, we
conduct experiments using the AVE [68] and the VGGSound [13] datasets in the appendix.

Baselines. We compare our proposed approach with vanilla Fine-tuning strategy, and continual learn-
ing methods EWC [32] and LwF [38]. As we mentioned before, typical continual learning methods,
e.g., class-incremental learning methods, which yield progressively increasing logits (or probability
distribution) across all observed classes at each incremental step and design specific technique in
the classifier, we consider that these methods are not an optimal choice for our proposed continual
audio-visual sound separation problem. Thus, considering that continual semantic segmentation
problem has a more similar form compared to conventional class-incremental learning, we also
select two state-of-the-art continual semantic segmentation methods PLOP [16] and EWF [78] as
our baselines. Moreover, we compare our method to the recently proposed audio-visual continual
learning method AV-CIL [53], in which we adapt the original class-incremental version to the form of
continual audio-visual sound separation by replacing their task-wise logits distillation with the output
mask distillation. Further, we also present the experimental results of the Oracle/Upper Bound, which
means that using the training data from all seen classes to train the model. For fair comparison, all
compared continual learning methods and our ContAV-Sep use the same state-of-the-art sepa-
rator, i.e. iQuery [14], as the base separation model. Further, we also incorporate our proposed and
baseline methods into another representative audio-visual sound separation model Co-Separation [23].
Notably, the Co-Separation model does not utilize the motion modality. Therefore, when CrossSDC is
applied to Co-Separation, the (mod1, mod2) in Eq. 7 and 9 is constrained to (mod1, mod2) = (a, o).
For baselines that involve memory sets, we ensure that each of them is allocated the same number of
memory as our proposed method for fair comparison.

Implementation Details. Following [14], we use a 7-layers U-Net [58] as the audio net, and sub-
sample the audio at 11kHz, each of which is approximately 6 seconds. We apply the STFT with

the Hann window size of 1022 and the hop length of 256, to obtain the 512 × 256 Time-Frequency
representation of each audio signal, followed by a re-sampling on the log-frequency scale to generate
the magnitude spectrogram with T, F = 256. We set the video frame rate (FPS) to 1, and detect the
object using the pre-trained universal detector Detic [87] to detect the sound source object on each
frame, and then, each detected object is resized and randomly cropped to the size of 224 × 224. For
the image encoder and the video encoder, we apply the self-supervised pre-trained CLIP [56] and
VideoMAE [69] to yield the object feature and motion feature, respectively. For the audio-visual
Transformer module, we follow the design in [14]. For all the baseline methods, we apply the same
model architecture and modules with ours for them, including the mentioned Detic, CLIP, VideoMAE,
audio-visual Transformer, etc. Please note that, during our training process, the pre-trained Detic,
CLIP, and VideoMAE are frozen. In our proposed Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint
(CrossSDC), the balance weights λins and λcls are set to 0.1 and 0.3, respectively. And the balance
weight λdist. for the output distillation loss is set to 0.3 in our experiments. For the memory set, we
set the number of samples in each old class to 1, so as other baselines that involve the memory set. All
the experiments in this paper are implemented by Pytorch [51]. We train our proposed method and all
baselines on a NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPU. We follow previous works [67, 14] in sound separation,
and evaluate the performance of all the methods using three common metrics in sound separation
tasks: Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR), Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR), and Signal to Artifact
Ratio (SAR). The SDR measures the interference and artifacts, while SIR and SAR measure the
interference and artifacts, respectively. In our experiments, we report the SDR, SIR, and SAR of all
the methods after training at last incremental steps, i.e., testing results on all classes. For all these
three metrics, higher values denote better results.

4.2
Experimental Comparison

The main experimental comparisons are shown in Tab. 1. Our proposed method, ContAV-Sep,
outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, compared to baselines
using state-of-the-art audio-visual sound separator iQuery [14] as the separation base model, ContAV-
Sep achieves a 0.3 improvement in SDR over the compared best-performing method. Additionally,
our method surpasses the top baseline by 0.25 in SIR and 0.41 in SAR. Furthermore, compared
to continual learning baselines with Co-Separation [23], our ContAV-Sep still outperforms other
approaches. This consistent superior performance across different model architectures highlights not
only the effectiveness but also the broad applicability and generalizability of our proposed CrossSDC.

Our observations further demonstrate that retaining a small memory set significantly enhances the
performance of each baseline method. For instance, for the iQuery-based continual learning methods,
equipping LwF [38] with a small memory set results in improvements of 3.31, 3.99, and 1.94 on
SDR, SIR, and SAR, respectively. Similarly, the addition of a small memory set to EWC [32] leads
to enhancements of 2.98, 3.43, and 1.43 in the respective metrics. The memory-augmented version of
PLOP [16] exhibits superior performance with margins of 3.21, 3.24, and 1.68 for SDR, SIR, and
SAR, respectively. Finally, incorporating memory into EWF [78] results in improvements of 1.37,

1.67, and 0.29 for the three metrics. This phenomenon can be attributed to the inherent nature of
the sound separation training process. In training, the audio signal from each sample mixes with
others, giving a composite audio signal. This mixed audio signal, coupled with the corresponding
visual data pair for each separated audio, constitutes the actual training sample for the separation task.
As a result, even a single memory sample can be associated with multiple samples from the current
training set, generating a diverse array of effective training pairs.

We also present the testing results of SDR, SIR, and SAR at each incremental step in Figures 3a, 3b,
and 3c, respectively. Our method is consistently observed to outperform others in terms of SDR at all
incremental steps. While our approach may not always produce the best SIR and SAR results at the
intermediate steps (specifically, steps 2 and 3 for SIR, and step 3 for SAR), it ultimately achieves the
highest performance at the final step. This demonstrates the robustness of our method, indicating
minimal forgetting throughout the incremental learning process.

4.3
Ablation Study on CrossSDC and Memory Size

In this subsection, we conduct an ablation study to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed
CrossSDC. By removing single or multiple components of the CrossSDC, we evaluate the impact of
each on the final results. The results of the ablation study are presented in Tab. 2. From the table, we
can see that our full model achieves the best performance compared to the variants, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed CrossSDC.

Moreover, we also discuss the effect of memory size on our proposed ContAV-Sep. In our main
experiments, the default setting of the memory size is 1 sample per old class. In this subsection, we
conduct experiments by increasing the memory size from 1 sample per old class to 30 samples per
old class. The experimental results are shown in Tab. 3 and Figure 4. Observations from the table
indicate a positive correlation between the size of the memory and the overall performance metrics.
As the memory size increases, there is a discernible trend of improvement in the results.

Limitation and Discussion

Our experimental findings reveal that the utilization of a small memory set, even a single sample
per old class, markedly improves the performance of each baseline method. This improvement is
attributed to the ability of a single memory sample to pair with diverse samples from the current
training set, thereby generating numerous effective training pairs. Consequently, this process enables
the model to acquire new knowledge for old classes in subsequent tasks, as the memory data can be

paired with data from previously unseen new classes — this is different from conventional continual
learning tasks, where old classes do not acquire new knowledge in new tasks. This could be a
potential reason why the baseline continual learning methods do not perform well in our continual
audio-visual sound separation problem. In this work, our method also mainly focuses on preserving
old knowledge of old tasks, which may prevent the model from acquiring new knowledge of old
classes when training in new tasks. Recognizing this, we identify the exploration of this problem as a
key avenue for future research in this field.

Additionally, the base model architectures used in our approach and baselines require object detectors
to identify sounding objects. Although iQuery [14] can supplement object features with global video
representations, it may still suffer from undetected objects. It is a fundamental limitation of the
object-based audio-visual sound separators [23, 14]. While our work, unlike previous efforts, does
not compete on designing a stronger audio-visual separation base model, enhancing the robustness of
sounding object detection presents a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore training audio-visual sound separation models under a more practical
continual learning scenario, and introduce the task of continual audio-visual sound separation. To
address this novel problem, we propose ContAV-Sep, which incorporates a Cross-modal Similarity
Distillation Constraint to maintain cross-modal semantic similarity across incremental tasks while
preserving previously learned semantic similarity knowledge. Experiments on the MUSIC-21 dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in this new continual separation task. This paper opens a
new direction for real-world audio-visual sound separation research.

Broader Impact. Our proposed continual audio-visual sound separation allows the model to adapt to
new environments and sounds without full retraining, which could enhance efficiency and privacy by
reducing the need to transmit and store sensitive audio data.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly reflect the paper’s contributions and
scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the work in Sec. 4.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not contain theoretical results or proof.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include an implementation paragraph section in Sec. 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our source code has been released. Datasets used in our experiments are
public dataset.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include an implementation paragraph section in Sec. 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Because of the limitation of computation resource, we didn’t report the error
bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

19


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper provides sufficient information of the computer resources needed to
reproduce the experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper does not violate any respect of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper discusses the potential societal impacts. We include it in Sec. 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, are properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

21


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets are introduced in the paper
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
