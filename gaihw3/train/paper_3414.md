Abstract

The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion
models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most
prior approaches rely on multiple images or video diffusion models, utilizing score
distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct
supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds
and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D
geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models
and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we
propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models
to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we
present a novel framework, Diffusion4D, for efficient and scalable 4D content
generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a
4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic
3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-
to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel
motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to
refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital
views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting
in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and
4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities. Our project page is

Introduction

The availability of internet-scale image-text-video datasets, coupled with progress in diffusion model
techniques [37, 32, 31], has propelled significant advancements in generating diverse and high-quality
visual content, including images, videos, and 3D assets [23, 13, 19, 34, 6, 48, 2]. These advancements
have further fostered much progress in the realm of 4D content generation [47, 16, 51, 1, 11, 30,
36, 7, 52], which has gained widespread attention across both research and industrial domains. The
ability to generate high-quality 4D content is key to various applications, ranging from the artistic
realms of animation and film production to the dynamic worlds of augmented reality.

However, generating high-quality 4D content efficiently and consistently remains a significant
challenge. ➊Due to the scarcity of large-scale multi-view consistent 4D datasets, earlier 4D synthesis
works [1, 57, 36] borrow appearance and motion priors from pretrained image- or video-diffusion
models, and leverage score distillation sampling (SDS) [28] for optimization. This strategy is

time-consuming and computationally inefficient due to the heavy supervision back-propagation,
limiting its widespread applicability. [51, 54] explored video-conditioned 4D generation and utilized
3D-aware image diffusion models to acquire pseudo multi-view data for photometric supervision.
Yet the issue of slow optimization speed persists. ➋Another primary challenge in 4D synthesis
is to guarantee 4D geometry consistency, which can be decomposed into two components: spatial
consistency and temporal consistency. As illustrated in Fig. 1, spatial consistency implies that the
object maintains consistent 3D geometry at each distinct timestamp, while temporal consistency
indicates that the object’s appearance and movement exhibit coherence and smoothness across
timestamps. These two components have been thoroughly explored separately in static multi-view
3D synthesis [19, 39, 34] and monocular video generation [3, 35, 4]. Multi-view 3D diffusion
models possess robust knowledge of geometrical consistency, whereas video diffusion models
encapsulate temporal appearance coherence and smooth motion priors. Recent approaches [27, 49]
tried combining these two generative models to enhance efficiency and consistency in 4D generation.
However, their underlying assumption of spatial-temporal conditional independence, the utilization
of multi-model supervision, or inference at distinct timestamps inherently leads to 4D geometry
inconsistencies. This raises the question: can we integrate spatial and temporal consistency into
a single network, and obtain multi-timestamp cross-view supervision in one shot? Inspired
by recent works in static 3D generation [41, 58] that repurposed temporal consistency in video
generation to spatial consistency in 3D generation, we design a strategy that achieves spatial-temporal
4D consistency with a singular 4D-aware video diffusion model.

To this end, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion4D, to achieve efficient and consistent genera-
tion of 4D content. First, to overcome the data scarcity issue, we meticulously curate a large-scale,
high-quality 4D dataset from a vast corpus of 3D datasets [10, 9]. Utilizing the curated dataset,
we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of generating orbital videos of dynamic 3D
objects, imitating the photographing process of 4D assets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first endeavor to adapt a video diffusion model and train on a 4D dataset for explicit novel view
synthesis of 4D assets. To explicitly control the dynamic strength of the assets, we propose a novel
3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric and embed it as conditions into the diffusion network. We also
incorporate the motion magnitude reconstruction loss to encourage the model to directly learn the
object’s 3D-to-4D dynamics. During the sampling stage, we propose a novel 3D-aware classifier-free
guidance to further enhance the dynamics of 3D assets. Leveraging the flexibility of the video
diffusion model architecture, our framework can seamlessly accommodate various prompts, including
text, single image, and static 3D content. It demonstrates the capability to generate highly spatial-
temporal consistent orbital views around 4D assets, thus providing comprehensive information for
the construction of 4D assets. Based on the generated orbital views of 4D assets, we perform explicit
4D construction by optimizing Gaussian splatting representations with off-the-shell 4D construction
pipelines [46, 15]. We develop a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with photometric losses. The
synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and
diverse 4D assets. In summary, our contributions can be summarized into three folds:

• We present a novel 4D content generation framework that, for the first time, adapts video diffusion
models for explicit synthesis of spatial-temporal consistent novel views of 4D assets. The 4D-aware
video diffusion model can seamlessly integrate with the off-the-shelf modern 4D construction
pipelines to efficiently create 4D content.

in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency, establishing a new benchmark for

Background

4D generation aims at synthesizing dynamic 3D content from various inputs, such as text, single
images, monocular videos, or static 3D assets. Extending 3D generation into the space-time domain,
this task requires not only consistent geometry prediction but also the generation of temporally
consistent dynamics. There are many works dedicated to this task. MAV3D[36] deals with text-
conditioned 4D generation by utilizing SDS derived from video diffusion models to optimize a
dynamic NeRF representation. 4DFY [1] tackles this problem by combining supervision signals
from image, video, and 3D-aware diffusion models. Animate124 [57] leverages both text and image
prompts to improve the appearance of the dynamic 3D assets. DreamGaussian4D [30] adopts the
deformable 3D Gaussians for 4D representations and tackles the image-conditioned generation with
a driving video. Similarly, 4DGen [51] proposes utilizing spatial-temporal pseudo labels and obtains
anchor frames with a multi-view diffusion model. Consistent4D [16] leverages the object-level
3D-aware image diffusion model for the primary supervision and proposes cascade DyNeRF to
facilitate stable training. More recent work STAG4D [54] uses a multi-view diffusion model to
initialize multi-view images anchored on input video frames and introduces a fusion strategy to
improve the temporal consistency. However, the use of SDS loss in these works results in slow
optimization speed and limits their applicability. To improve the efficiency, Efficient4D [27] generates
multi-view captures of dynamic 3D objects through SyncDreamer-T, while Diffusion2[49] leverages
orthogonal diffusion models to sample dense views. Despite the high efficiency, the assumptions
of spatial-temporal conditional independence, multiple model utilization, and distinct-timestamp
inference design inherently lead to 4D geometry inconsistencies. Unlike previous methods, our
framework is the first to integrate 4D spatial-temporal consistency into a singular video diffusion
model. More discussions about related works are in App. A.1.

Method

In this section, we provide a detailed illustration of the proposed framework, Diffusion4D, designed
for the efficient and consistent generation of 4D content. We initiate by formulating the problem
and outlining the key objectives in 3.1. Then, we introduce our data curation strategy pivotal in
acquiring a large-scale, high-quality 4D dataset in 3.2. Subsequently, we delve into the methodology
of applying the curated dataset to develop 4D-aware video diffusion models, capable of synthesizing
orbital views of dynamic 3D assets conditioning on various forms of prompts in 3.3. Finally, we
introduce the explicit construction of 4D assets using 4D models based on the Gaussian Splitting
representations in 3.4.

3.1
Problem Setting and Key Objectives

Formally, given a prompt y, we aim to generate an orbital video V = {Ii ∈RH×W ×3}
T
i=1 around a
dynamic 3D asset. This video comprises T multi-view images captured at T consecutive timestamps
T = {τi}T
i=1 along a predefined camera pose trajectory, where H and W are the height and width
dimensions of images. To simplify the problem, we put constraints on the camera pose trajectory,
assuming that the camera always looks at the center of an object (origin of the world coordinates)
with a fixed elevation angle and camera distance. Thus, the viewpoint can be uniquely specified by
the azimuth angle. The azimuth angle uniformly increases from 0 to 360 degrees along T timestamps,
constructing a complete orbital video. We aim to generate this orbital video with a 4D-aware video
diffusion model that can iteratively denoise samples from the learned conditional distribution p(V|y),
where y can be text, single images, or static 3D content. At the end, explicit 4D construction is
performed with generated orbital video V as supervisions.

3.2
Data Curation

The development of the proposed 4D-aware video diffusion model requires a substantial amount
of high-quality 4D assets. We curate a large-scale, high-quality dynamic 3D dataset sourced from
the vast 3D data corpus of Objaverse-1.0 [10] and Objaverse-XL [9]. Since the original Objaverse
dataset primarily consists of static 3D assets and many of them are of low quality (e.g., partial
scans, missing textures) [38], we applied a series of empirical rules to filter the dataset. The curation
process includes an initial selection with dynamic label, removal of assets with subtle or overly
dramatic motion, and out-of-boundary detection. In the initial step, we select 3D assets labeled
as "dynamic". However, upon closer examination, we observe that many assets exhibit subtle or
imperceptible movement, limiting their utility in learning dynamic properties in the proposed task.
To mitigate this problem, we employ Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to evaluate the
temporal dynamics of the assets. Specifically, for each 4D asset, we fix the camera pose at the front
view and render three images at three distinct timestamps (τ0, τT/4, and τT/2), then compute two
SSIM scores between them. Assets with both SSIM scores higher than a predetermined threshold
shigh = 0.95, suggesting high resemblance and little movement, are discarded. We also observe
that many samples exhibit significant geometric distortion or drastic appearance changes over time.
Therefore, we empirically set an SSIM score of small value slow = 0.4 as the lower bound to filter
out cases of poor quality. Subsequently, for each remaining 4D asset, we render T = 24 multi-view
images following the camera pose trajectory and timeline settings as we defined in Sec. 3.1. In
the final step, we handle cases where assets exhibit over-dramatic movements that extend out of
the boundaries of the scene. We employ alpha maps to identify and remove such cases and ensure
that only appropriately positioned dynamic assets are included in the curated dataset, enhancing the
overall quality and coherence of the generated content. Finally, we also conduct a manual inspection
over Objaverse-1.0 [10] to remove low-quality cases that do not make sense semantically. This
comprehensive strategy results in a total of 81K high-quality animated assets. We released the IDs of
the dynamic 3D assets in our curated dataset.

3.3
4D-Aware Video Generation

Utilizing the curated dataset, we can render a vast number of orbital videos of dynamic 3D assets to
train a 4D-aware video diffusion model. For pretrained model selection, given that conventional video
diffusion models designed for monocular video generation lack 3D geometry priors, we resort to
the recent works of 3D-aware video generation models [41, 58]. In the following, we first introduce
the pretrained 3D-aware video diffusion model. Then, we describe how to adapt the model to our
4D-aware orbital video generation task. At this point, we focus on explicitly specifying the motion
magnitude guidance, directly learning the 3D-to-4D dynamics in the training stage, and further
augmenting the 3D object dynamics in the inference stage. Finally, we introduce how we utilize the
curated dataset and customize the model architecture to accommodate various condition modalities.

Pretrained 3D-aware video diffusion models. The main idea of 3D-aware video diffusion mod-
els [41, 58] is to repurpose the temporal consistency in video generation models for the spatial 3D

consistency of static 3D objects. Capitalizing on pretrained video diffusion models [3, 42, 56], these
models are finetuned on large-scale datasets of high-quality 3D assets. It facilitates them to generate
smooth and consistent orbital views of static 3D objects with user-specified camera pose conditions.
In our method, we inherit the 3D geometry consistency in these models and extend it to modeling the
spatial-temporal consistency in orbital views of 4D objects.

Vanilla 4D-aware video diffusion models. Modern video diffusion models typically carry out
diffusion and denoising processes in latent space [4, 53]. In our specific task, given an orbital video
V around a 4D asset, which is rendered from curated dataset following the camera position trajectory
introduced in Sec. 3.1, we first use a pretrained encoder to encode images into a compressed latent
z0 ∈RT ×h×w×c. The h, w, c respectively denote the height, width, and channel dimension of the
latent representation. The diffusion forward process samples a time step t and adds noise ϵt to source
input and obtain zt. A denoising network ϵθ, parameterized by θ, is trained to predict the added noise
conditioned on y, with a noise prediction loss Lldm = ∥ϵt −ϵθ(zt, y, t)∥2
2. In the inference stage,
as shown in Fig. 2, given an initial random gaussian noise and prompt condition y, the denoising
network predicts the added noise to iteratively denoise the latent embedding. A denoised latent ˆz0 is
finally obtained, which is decoded via a pretrained decoder to recover a high-fidelity orbital video.

3D-to-4D motion magnitude guidance and reconstruction. For the 4D-aware video generation,
one of the most interesting attributes is the dynamic strength of the 3D assets. In an effort to enhance
the control over the 3D-to-4D dynamic strength, we introduce the motion magnitude guidance into
the diffusion model. To begin with, we need to quantitatively measure the motion magnitude of the
moving objects. In contrast to the previous video models [8] that measure the motion magnitude by
computing the inter-frame differences, the appearance differences across frames in V originate from
both camera-view changes and object movement. To remove the influence from the camera-view
changes, for each dynamic 3D object, we also render an orbital video ¯V = {¯Ii ∈RH×W ×3}
T
i=1
around the static 3D asset, consisting of T multi-view images captured at the same camera poses
as V at timestamp τ0. Consecutively, we propose a metric named 3D-to-4D motion magnitude m
measuring the dynamic strength:

m(V) = 1

T

i=1
||Ii −¯Ii||2

(1)

Motivated by previous works [58], we use a two-layer multi-layer perception (MLP) to extract a
motion magnitude embedding, which is combined with the time embedding and injected into the
denosing network. The noise prediction function by the denoising network accordingly changes to
ϵθ(zt, y, m, t). This design allows the user to explicitly control the motion magnitude in inference
stage. The impact of the motion magnitude guidance on the generation results is illustrated in Fig. 5.

In the training phase, to encourage the denoising network to learn the 3D-to-4D dynamics, we
incorporate the motion magnitude reconstruction loss. This loss facilitates the direct learning of
dynamic strength with explicit supervision over motion magnitude from 3D to 4D dynamics. For the
sake of computation cost, we apply the reconstruction loss in the latent space and it is formulated as:

Lmr = ||m(z0) −m(ˆz0)||2
2, m(z0) = 1

T ||z0 −¯z0||2
2.
(2)

, where ˆz0 denotes the estimated clean video latent during training, the ¯z0 denotes the compressed
latent of ¯V by the pretrained encoder. Our diffusion model training loss is formulated by combining
latent diffusion loss and motion magnitude reconstruction loss with a weight ω: L = Lldm + ωLmr.

3D-aware classifier-free guidance. To further augment the dynamic strength of 3D objects, we draw
inspiration from classifier-free guidance [14] and propose a 3D-aware classifier-free guidance. It uses
the pretrained 3D-aware video diffusion model, formulated as ¯ϵθ, to provide classifier-free guidance
during the inference stage. Combining the prompt condition y, motion magnitude guidance m, the
unconditional noise prediction ϵθ(zt, t) and 3D-aware noise prediction ¯ϵθ(zt, y, t), the denoising step
is reformulated as:

ˆϵθ(zt, y, m, t) = ϵθ(zt, y, m, t) + w1(ϵθ(zt, y, m, t) −ϵθ(zt, t)) + w2(ϵθ(zt, y, m, t) −¯ϵθ(zt, y, t))

(3)
, where ˆϵθ(zt, y, m, t) is joint noise prediction, and w1 and w2 are the classfier-free guidance scalers.

Generation with various condition modalities. In the above formulations, we use y as a general
prompt condition. Thanks to the versatility of our high-quality 4D dataset and the flexibility of
the 3D-aware video diffusion model architecture, our framework can readily accommodate diverse
prompt modalities, including text, single images, or static 3D contents. For the text condition, we
obtain the text description of each dynamic 3D asset from the prior work [22], and the text embedding
extracted by CLIP model is fed into the diffusion model via the cross-attention mechanism. You can
refer to [42] for more details. For the image condition, we use the first view image I0 in V captured
at timestamp τ0 as the reference image. The image condition is injected into the diffusion model with
both cross-attention mechanism and feature concatenation. Please refer to [56, 3] for more details.
For static 3D content condition, we use ¯V as the reference video. Similar to the image condition,
the video features are extracted by pretrained encoder and and fed into the diffusion model via feature
concatenation. This versatility allows our framework to effectively respond to different condition
modalities, facilitating seamless integration into a wide range of applications and scenarios.

3.4
Coarse-to-Fine 4D Construction

The spatial-temporal consistent multi-view videos generated by our 4D-aware video diffusion model
offer comprehensive information about the 3D geometry and motions of dynamic 3D assets. At
this stage, we explicitly model the 4D assets with Gaussian splatting(GS) [18] owing to its explicit
representation, powerful fitting capabilities, and efficient optimization with dense-view supervision.
We resort to the state-of-the-art 4D construction pipelines, i.e. 4DGS [46] and SC-GS [15]. When we
directly train the GS on the generated multi-view video V, we find that the model does not perform
well in capturing the 3D geometry details. The visualization can be found in Fig. 5(e). Therefore,
we augment the supervision signals and propose a coarse-to-fine construction strategy. In the coarse
stage, given the first-view image I0 in V, we use the pretrained 3D-aware video diffusion model to
generate an orbital-view video ¯V
′ of the static 3D object. As our 4D-aware video diffusion model is
finetuned on this model, we observe high 3D geometry consistency between ¯V
′ and V. We merge
them together to train the GS in the coarse training stage. Note that the two sets of images (V and ¯V
′)
are of the same orbital views at different timestamps, V ranging from 0 to 1, and ¯V
′ at 0 only. Actually,
for static 3D content conditioned generation, we can readily replace ¯V
′ with conditional signal ¯V into
the image set for coarse training. In the fine training stage, we use V only to further tune the GS to
improve the spatial-temporal consistency. Thanks to the 4D consistency in our generated videos, we
can achieve precise pixel-level matching across different views and timestamps. We follow [46] and
use L1 and Llpips [55] losses for optimization. To enforce geometry smoothness, we also involve
depth smoothness loss as regularizer [5, 25]. For 4DGS-based reconstruction [46], the total loss is
formulated as Lgs = λl1L1 + λlpipsLlpips + λdepthLdepth. For SC-GS based reconstruction [15],
λarapLarap is also involved. The λl1, λlpips, λarap, and λdepth are losses weights.

Experimentation

4.1
Experiment Setup

We employ Diffusion4D to generate 4D assets conditioned on multiple modalities of prompts, i.e.
text, single image, and static 3D content. Leveraging the curated dataset, for each dynamic 3D asset,
we render two 360-degree orbital videos V′s with T = 24, one starting at the front view and the
other starting at a random azimuth angle. We fix the elevation angle as 0 and the camera distance
as 2-meter. The image resolution is chosen at 256 × 256 across the experiments. In preparation
for static 3D content-conditioned generation, following the camera poses of each rendered video V,
we also render two 360-degree orbital video ¯V′s of each static 3D asset fixed at initial timestamp
τ0. We use VideoMV [58] as the pretrained 3D-aware video diffusion model, which is trained on a
large scale of static 3D assets of superior quality. Specifically, for text-conditioned 4D-aware video
generation, we adopt the text-to-3D video generator [58] that is based on the ModelScopeT2V [42]
model architecture. For image and video conditions, we adopt the image-to-3D video generator [58]
that is finetuned from I2VGen-XL [56]. We train our 4D-aware video diffusion model for 6k iterations
with a constant learning rate of 3 × 10−5. We use a valid batch size of 128 and train on 8 NVIDIA
A100 GPUs. During the sampling stage, we use text, front-view images, front-view started orbital
videos of static 3D assets as conditions. we use DDIM [37] sampling with sampling step 50, and
w1 = 7.0 and w2 = 0.5 in classifier-free guidance. In the 4D construction stage, for 4DGS, we

optimized the GS representation for 5k iterations in the coarse stage and 2k iterations in the fine stage.
For SC-GS, we optimized the GS for 16k iterations in the coarse stage and 4k iterations in the fine
stage. Following prior works [30, 51], by default, we use reconstructions from 4DGS for quantitative
and qualitative comparisons with the baselines.

4.2
Metric

From the curated dataset, we leave out 20 cases as the test set for evaluation. For quantitative
assessment, we first use the CLIP [29] score to evaluate the semantic correlation between the prompts
(reference) and synthesized images (target). In each case, depending on the condition modality, the
text description or front-view image serves as the reference. For the diffusion generation, we use all
24 images in orbital videos as targets, and for 4D construction, we uniformly render 36 orbital views
from constructed 4D assets as targets (CLIP-O). We also measure using only front-view images as
targets(CLIP-F). To evaluate the appearance and texture quality and the spatial-temporal consistency
of the synthesized images, we also use the following metrics, i.e. LPIPS [55], PSNR, SSIM [45], and
FVD [40], to help assess image- and static 3D content-conditioned generation. For these evaluations,
we use ground truth images rendered from the dynamic 3D assets as references. Images generated by
the diffusion model or rendered from constructed 4D assets are used as targets. Metrics are computed
between ground truth images and synthesized images from the same camera pose. The same procedure
is applied to calculate the scores for baseline methods. We also conduct qualitative comparisons
through a user study involving 30 human evaluators from diverse backgrounds. Participants are asked
to specify their preference for rendered orbital videos around 4D assets based on four properties,
following the approach in [1]: 3D geometry consistency (3DC), appearance quality(AQ), motion
fidelity(MF), and text alignment(TA). We report the percentage of users who prefer each method
overall and based on each of the four properties.

Main Results

Text-conditioned and image-conditioned 4D generation. We take 4DFY [1] and Animate124 [57]
as baselines for text-conditioned generation, and 4DGen[51] and STAG4D[54] as baselines for
image-conditioned generation, due to their remarkable performance and adaptability to the task
settings. In Fig. 3 we provide a detailed comparison between our method and baselines with various
prompts. For the baselines, we provide two views at starting and ending timestamps. For our method,
we visualize the spatial-temporal renderings from 4D constructions at five consecutive timestamps
in multiple views. We also show the generated multi-view images from our video diffusion models
(denoted with *). Our efficient and elegant pipeline is capable of generating diverse and realistic 4D
assets with satisfactory geometrical and temporal consistency. While the baselines also synthesize
4D assets, their results exhibit very limited or even invisible motion. In contrast, our results show
apparent motions of great fidelity. As highlighted by the contours in Fig. 3, our animations include
cartoon characters and humans stepping forward, running or raising arms, birds flapping wings, and
lights changing. Our method also provides more detailed appearances. The quantitative results in

Figure 5: Ablation study of different components of our proposed framework.

Tab. 1 demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches across all metrics and user
preferences. Compared with the state-of-the-art SDS-based methods, which involve sophisticated
and time-consuming optimization, our method is much more efficient and produces more favorable
results. Users showed a strong preference for Diffusion4D over other baselines, especially in 3D
geometry consistency and motion fidelity. Also, as 4D construction is based on the images from the
diffusion models, we can observe that diffusion outputs perform slightly better than rendered outputs.

Static 3D content-conditioned 4D generation. We visualized the results of static 3D content-
conditioned generation in Fig. 4. Our framework successfully activates static 3D assets and generates
spatial-temporal consistent 4D assets. Due to the lack of direct baselines, we compare our image-
conditioned 4D generation with 3D content-conditioned generation. The difference between these two
settings is that the former relies only on a single image, whereas the latter has access to dense views
of the 3D assets. While both can generate realistic dynamic 3D assets, the latter can generate more
3D geometry-consistent objects. As shown in the last two rows in Fig. 4, Mario and anthropomorphic
mouse closely follows the appearance and geometry of the prompts, particularly from the side and
back views. The quantitative results in Tab. 1 indicate that the static 3D content-conditioned setting
achieves the best performance among all tasks, thanks to the access to dense views of source assets.

Ablation Study

We conduct an analysis on the effect of various design components in our framework with the typical
image-to-4D generation task, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 and Tab. 2. In the 4D-aware diffusion
model, we incorporated multiple features to enhance the dynamics of 3D assets. We added each
feature incrementally to demonstrate their impact. In Fig. 5 (1), we can observe that training without
motion magnitude reconstruction loss results in nearly invisible movement (a), while incorporating it
introduces subtle motion (b). Increasing the motion magnitude guidance (m) augments the dynamics
of the kid (c). The involvement of 3D-aware classifier-free guidance significantly augments the

without the coarse stage leads to incomplete 3D geometry (e). Comparing (f) and (g), we can observe
that adding the fine stage enhances the appearance and texture details of the generated 4D assets.
Results in Tab. 2 indicate that the removal of each proposed component leads to a noticeable drop in
metrics. In summary, the full model delivers the best results both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Limitation and Future work

While our proposed Diffusion4D framework demonstrates significant advancements in terms of
efficiency and consistency for 4D content generation, we acknowledge the following limitations
to provide a foundation for future work. First, we use a video size of 24 × 256 × 256. While this
resolution provides a good balance between quality and computational feasibility, higher resolution
and longer temporal sequences could further enhance the detail and realism of 4D content generation.
Image resolution could be improved using off-the-shelf super-resolution models. Second, though we
curated a substantial amount of high-quality data, the dataset still lacks diversity. The asset textures
are simple, with actions restricted to basic movements such as walking, jumping, and stretching arms.
Although there is a large number of characters, each character appears only a few times, performing
a limited range of actions. Last, in the 4D reconstruction stage, the performance is subject to the
capacity of off-the-shelf 4D construction pipelines. In our settings, we empirically find that both of
the chosen 4D construction pipelines work well in constructing consistent 4D assets from orbital
views. Comparatively, SC-GS performs better than 4DGS from more novel views. Due to the limited
views for supervision, the constructed 4D assets may meet floaters and blurry problems when the
objects have large motions. In future research, we will try to expand the diversity and quality of
the dynamic 3D dataset. We will focus on exploring 4D reconstruction to improve the model’s
ability to interpret and leverage orbital-view supervisions, which will be beneficial for generating 4D
assets with better consistency across novel views. We will put more effort into generating longer and
higher-resolution 4D orbital videos to support more detailed 4D construction, potentially broadening
the applications for Diffusion4D.

Conclusion

In this work, we introduced Diffusion4D, an efficient and scalable framework for spatial-temporal
consistent 4D generation. Motivated by the prior explorations using video diffusion model to generate
orbital views of static 3D assets, we migrate the temporal consistency in the video diffusion model
to spatial-temporal consistency in 4D generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D
dataset, we developed a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of
dynamic 3D assets. We incorporate 3D-to-4D motion magnitude guidance and the motion magnitude
reconstruction loss to enhance the dynamics learning and control. 3D-aware classifier-free guidance
is introduced to further augment the dynamic strength. We fulfill explicit 4D construction with a
coarse-to-fine learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method surpasses prior
state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across
various prompt modalities. This innovative approach not only addresses the limitations of previous
methods but also sets a new benchmark for 4D content generation.

Related Work

A.1.1
3D Generation

3D generation aims to create static 3D content from text or images. DreamFusion [28], first introduces
the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss to optimize NeRF with diffusion models. However, The
original form of SDS encounters challenges such as multi-face Janus issues and slow optimization.
Subsequent works [19, 20, 43, 44, 26, 33, 34, 50] have attempted to refine the mechanism to address
these issues. Another research direction [19, 21, 20, 39] focus on generating dense multi-view images
with consistent 3D properties directly. They achieve this by training or fine-tuning 2D diffusion
models on 3D datasets to better suit 3D generation tasks. Zero123 [19] generates a 2D image from an
unseen view based on a single image. SyncDreamer [20] can generate multiview-consistent images
from a single input image. Some later works [33, 34] explicitly generate fixed multi-view images in
one diffusion pass. The generated images can be used for reconstructing 3D content. Some other
works like Point-E [24] and Shap-E [17] train models to directly generate 3D point clouds or meshes.

A.1.2
Video Generation

Video generation has obtained significant advancements. Diffusion has been employed for video pre-
diction tasks in recent years, which have achieved great levels of realism, diversity, and controllability.
Among them, video LDM [4] applies the latent diffusion framework for video generation. SVD
[3] follows the same architecture and inserts temporal convolution and attention layers after every
spatial convolution and attention layer, achieving effective performance improvement. W.A.L.T [12]
introduces window attention architecture for joint spatial and spatio-temporal generative modeling.
Some recent works [41, 58] have tried to leverage temporal consistency [? ] from video generation
but are limited to static 3D generation tasks. Inspired by their success, our work focuses on utilizing
spatial consistency from video diffusion models for 4D generation tasks.

A.1.3
4D Generation

Compared to 3D generation, 4D generation requires not only predicting consistent geometry but also
generating temporal-consistent dynamics. There are a few recent works dedicated to this task. One
line of research works predict 4D representations conditioned on a single image and text description.
MAV3D [36] deals with a text-to-4D problem by utilizing score distillation sampling derived from
video diffusion models to optimize a dynamic NeRF based on textual prompts. Animate124 [57]
leverages a dynamic NeRF-based representation to tackle this problem. 4DFY [1] addresses text-to-
4D synthesis by combining supervision signals from image, video and 3D-aware diffusion models.
DreamGaussian4D [30] adopts the deformable 3D Gaussian as 4D representations. 4DGen [51]
proposes a novel pipeline where they utilize spatial-temporal pseudo labels into anchor frames with
a multi-view diffusion model. Another line of work predicts dynamic objects from single-view
videos. Consistent4D [16] leverages the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model as the primary
supervision signal for training Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, and proposing cascade DyNeRF to
facilitate stable training. More recent work STAG4D [54] utilizes a multi-view diffusion model to
initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames and introduce a fusion strategy to
ensure temporal consistency. Efficient4D [27] generates multi-frame multi-view captures of dynamic
3D objects through SyncDreamer-T and reconstructs 4D representations with them.

A.2
Experimental Details about Baselines implementation

For the baselines, we followed the instructions from their public websites to do experiments. 4DFY [1]
is designed for text-to-4D generation. We fed in the text prompts directly to get the generation results.
Animate124 [57] requires a pair of text and image prompts for generation. Therefore, we use the
first front-view image in our generated video as the image prompt for generation. In the image-to-4D
generation, both 4DGen [51] and STAG4D [54] propose to use pretrained video diffusion models to
generate monocular videos as the prompt conditions. To boost their performance, we directly render
ground-truth images at the front view from the source dynamic 3D datasets and obtain the monocular
dynamic videos as prompts.

innovations. These contributions are accurately detailed in the main body of the paper,
where each component is thoroughly explained, implemented, and evaluated.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed about the limitations and future works of this submission in
APP. 5. This includes the need for higher image resolution and longer temporal sequences
to enhance visualization and detail in 4D construction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We do not include theoretical results in our submission.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We describe our method in great details in Sec.4.1, experimental details in
Sec.4.1 and App. A.2, the comprehensive evaluation metrics in Sec. 4.2, and the data curation
strategies in Sec. 3.2 and App. ??.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.

17


---Page Break---
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will release the code and the dynamic 3D assets idx of the dataset for
reproduction of the results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the details in Sec. 4.1 and App. A.2. All training details such as
model parameters, dataset used, and metrics are discussed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [No] ,

Justification: In this particular literature, error bars and confidence intervals are not typically
reported. It is not clear what assumptions should be made on error distributions. So we do
not report error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide information about compute resources in Table 1. Our 4D con-
struction model is trained on an A100 in 8 minutes to get the results. We also provide the
details about cost of training diffusion model in App. A.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper demonstrates a high level of research integrity by providing detailed
methodologies, transparent data curation processes, and thorough analyses. We also empha-
size reproducibility by fully disclosing the information needed to replicate the experiments.
The research adheres to all relevant legal and ethical standards regarding the use of data and
research practices.

Guidelines:

19


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We disucss our positive societal impacts in Sec. 1. Our work has a positive
effect on the generating area, helping artists and designers to create high-quality 4D content
quickly. We do not find that there are direct negative societal impacts of this work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: By providing detailed information about the curation process and the safe-
guards implemented, the paper promotes transparency. This allows other researchers and
practitioners to understand the steps taken to ensure ethical use and to replicate these
safeguards in their own work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

20


---Page Break---
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The creators or original owners of the assets used in the paper are properly
credited, and the license and terms of use are explicitly mentioned and properly respected.
The paper clearly credits the original source of the 3D data corpus, and provides citations
for all the models, methods, and algorithms it builds upon or compares against.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We did not provide any new assets alongside this paper. The paper describes in
detail the curation process of a high-quality dynamic 3D dataset sourced from the Objaverse
dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For the user study, we provide the details of this part in Sec. 4.3.

Guidelines:

21


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We did not study on human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
