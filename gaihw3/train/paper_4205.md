Abstract

The surge in applications of large language models (LLMs) has prompted con-
cerns about the generation of misleading or fabricated information, known as hal-
lucinations. Therefore, detecting hallucinations has become critical to maintaining
trust in LLM-generated content. A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness
classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled truthful and hallucinated data. To
address the challenge, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that
leverages the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection.
Such unlabeled data arises freely upon deploying LLMs in the open world, and
consists of both truthful and hallucinated information. To harness the unlabeled
data, we present an automated membership estimation score for distinguishing be-
tween truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled mixture data, thereby
enabling the training of a binary truthfulness classifier on top. Importantly, our
framework does not require extra data collection and human annotations, offering
strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experi-
ments show that HaloScope can achieve superior hallucination detection perfor-
mance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin. Code is
available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/haloscope.

Introduction

In today’s rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning, large language models (LLMs) have
emerged as transformative forces shaping various applications [35, 45]. Despite the immense capa-
bilities, they bring forth challenges to the model’s reliability upon deployment in the open world.
For example, the model can generate information that is seemingly informative but untruthful dur-
ing interaction with humans, placing critical decision-making at risk [19, 53]. Therefore, a reliable
LLM should not only accurately generate texts that are coherent with the prompts but also possess
the ability to identify hallucinations. This gives rise to the importance of hallucination detection
problem, which determines whether a generation is truthful or not [32, 6, 25].

A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness classifier is the scarcity of labeled datasets contain-
ing truthful and hallucinated generations. In practice, generating a reliable ground truth dataset for
hallucination detection requires human annotators to assess the authenticity of a large number of
generated samples. However, collecting such labeled data can be labor-intensive, especially con-
sidering the vast landscape of generative models and the diverse range of content they produce.
Moreover, maintaining the quality and consistency of labeled data amidst the evolving capabilities
and outputs of generative models requires ongoing annotation efforts and stringent quality control
measures. These formidable obstacles underscore the need for exploring unlabeled data for halluci-
nation detection.

Membership Estimation

Figure 1: Illustration of our proposed framework HaloScope for hallucination detection, leveraging unlabeled
LLM generations in the wild. HaloScope first identifies the latent subspace to estimate the membership (truthful
vs. hallucinated) for samples in unlabeled data M and then learns a binary truthfulness classifier.

Motivated by this, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that leverages unlabeled
LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection. The unlabeled data is easy-to-access and
can emerge organically as a result of interactions with users in chat-based applications. Imagine, for
example, a language model such as GPT [35] deployed in the wild can produce vast quantities of
text continuously in response to user prompts. This data can be freely collectible, yet often contains
a mixture of truthful and potentially hallucinated content. Formally, the unlabeled generations can
be characterized as a mixed composition of two distributions:
Punlabeled = (1 −π)Ptrue + πPhal,
where Ptrue and Phal denote the marginal distribution of truthful and hallucinated data, and π is
the mixing ratio. Harnessing the unlabeled data is non-trivial due to the lack of clear membership
(truthful or hallucinated) for samples in mixture data.

Central to our framework is the design of an automated membership estimation score for distinguish-
ing between truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled data, thereby enabling the training
of a binary truthfulness classifier on top. Our key idea is to utilize the language model’s latent repre-
sentations, which can capture information related to truthfulness. Specifically, HaloScope identifies
a subspace in the activation space associated with hallucinated statements, and considers a point to
be potentially hallucinated if its representation aligns strongly with the components of the subspace
(see Figure 2). This idea can be operationalized by performing factorization on LLM embeddings,
where the top singular vectors form the latent subspace for membership estimation. Specifically, the
membership estimation score measures the norm of the embedding projected onto the top singular
vectors, which exhibits different magnitudes for the two types of data. Our estimation score offers a
straightforward mathematical interpretation and is easily implementable in practical applications.

Extensive experimental results on contemporary LLMs confirm that HaloScope can effectively im-
prove hallucination detection performance across diverse datasets spanning open-book and closed-
book conversational QA tasks (Section 4).
Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, we sub-
stantially improve the hallucination detection accuracy by 10.69% (AUROC) on a challenging
TRUTHFULQA benchmark [29], which favorably matches the supervised upper bound (78.64 % vs.
81.04%). Furthermore, we delve deeper into understanding the key components of our methodol-
ogy (Section 4.4), and extend our inquiry to showcase HaloScope versatility in addressing real-world
scenarios with practical challenges (Section 4.3). To summarize our key contributions:

• Our proposed framework HaloScope formalizes the hallucination detection problem by
harnessing the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild. This formulation offers strong
practicality and flexibility for real-world applications.
• We present a scoring function based on the hallucination subspace from the LLM represen-
tations, effectively estimating membership for samples within the unlabeled data.
• We conduct in-depth ablations to understand the efficacy of various design choices in Halo-
Scope, and verify its scalability to large LLMs and different datasets. These results provide
a systematic and comprehensive understanding of leveraging the unlabeled data for hallu-
cination detection, shedding light on future research.

Problem Setup

Formally, we describe the LLM generation and the problem of hallucination detection.

Definition 2.1 (LLM generation). We consider an L-layer causal LLM, which takes a sequence of n
tokens xprompt = {x1, ..., xn}, and generates an output x = {xn+1, ..., xn+m} in an autoregressive
manner. Each output token xi, i ∈[n + 1, ..., n + m] is sampled from a distribution over the model
vocabulary V, conditioned on the prefix {x1, ..., xi−1}:

xi = argmaxx∈V P(x|{x1, ..., xi−1}),
(1)

and the probability P is calculated as:

P(x|{x1, ..., xi−1}) = softmax(wofL(x) + bo),
(2)

where fL(x) ∈Rd denotes the representation at the L-th layer of LLM for token x, and wo, bo are
the weight and bias parameters at the final output layer.

Definition 2.2 (Hallucination detection). We denote Ptrue as the joint distribution over the truthful
input and generation pairs, which is referred to as truthful distribution. For any given generated
text x and its corresponding input prompt xprompt where (xprompt, x) ∈X, the goal of hallucination
detection is to learn a binary predictor G : X →{0, 1} such that

G(xprompt, x) =
 1,
if (xprompt, x) ∼Ptrue
0,
otherwise

Proposed Framework: HaloScope

3.1
Unlabeled LLM Generations in the Wild

Our key idea is to leverage unlabeled LLM generations in the wild, which emerge organically as a
result of interactions with users in chat-based applications. Imagine, for example, a language model
such as GPT deployed in the wild can produce vast quantities of text continuously in response
to user prompts. This data can be freely collectible, yet often contains a mixture of truthful and
potentially hallucinated content. Formally, the unlabeled generations can be characterized by the
Huber contamination model [18] as follows:

Definition 3.1 (Unlabeled data distribution). We define the unlabeled LLM input and generation
pairs to be the following mixture of distributions

Punlabeled = (1 −π)Ptrue + πPhal,
(4)

where π ∈(0, 1]. Note that the case π = 0 is idealistic since no false information occurs. In
practice, π can be a moderately small value when most of the generations remain truthful.

Definition 3.2 (Empirical dataset). An empirical set M = {(x1
prompt, ex1), ..., (xN
prompt, exN)} is
sampled independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from this mixture distribution Punlabeled,
where N is the number of samples. exi denotes the response generated with respect to some input
prompt xi
prompt, with the tilde symbolizing the uncertain nature of the generation.

Despite the wide availability of unlabeled generations, harnessing such data is non-trivial due to the
lack of clear membership (truthful or hallucinated) for samples in mixture data M. In a nutshell, our
framework aims to devise an automated function that estimates the membership for samples within
the unlabeled data, thereby enabling the training of a binary classifier on top (as shown in Figure 1).
In what follows, we describe these two steps in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 respectively.

3.2
Estimating Membership via Latent Subspace

The first step of our framework involves estimating the membership (truthful vs untruthful) for data
instances within a mixture dataset M. The ability to effectively assign membership for these two
types of data relies heavily on whether the language model’s representations can capture information

3


---Page Break---
related to truthfulness. Our idea is that if we could identify a latent subspace associated with hallu-
cinated statements, then we might be able to separate them from the rest. We describe the procedure
formally below.

Embedding factorization. To realize the idea, we extract embeddings from the language model for
samples in the unlabeled mixture M. Specifically, let F ∈RN×d denote the matrix of embeddings
extracted from the language model for samples in M, where each row represents the embedding
vector f ⊤
i
of a data sample (xi
prompt, exi). To identify the subspace, we perform singular value de-
composition:

fi := fi −µ

F = UΣV⊤,
(5)

where µ ∈Rd is the average embedding across all N samples, which is used to center the embedding
matrix. The columns of U and V are the left and right singular vectors, and form an orthonormal
basis. In principle, the factorization can be performed on any layer of the LLM representations,
which will be analyzed in Section 4.4. Such a factorization is useful, because it enables discovering
the most important spanning direction of the subspace for the set of points in M.

Figure 2: Visualization of the representations for
truthful (in orange) and hallucinated samples (in
purple), and their projection onto the top singular
vector v1 (in gray dashed line).

Membership estimation via latent subspace.
To
gain insight, we begin with a special case of the
problem where the subspace is 1-dimensional, a
line through the origin. Finding the best-fitting line
through the origin with respect to a set of points
{fi|1 ≤i ≤N} means minimizing the sum of the
squared distances of the points to the line.
Here,
distance is measured perpendicular to the line. Geo-
metrically, finding the first singular vector v1 is also
equivalent to maximizing the total distance from the
projected embedding (onto the direction of v1) to the
origin (sum over all points in M):

v1 = argmax∥v∥2=1

N
X

i=1
⟨fi, v⟩2 ,
(6)

where ⟨·, ·⟩is a dot product operator. As illustrated in Figure 2, hallucinated data samples may
exhibit anomalous behavior compared to truthful generation, and locate farther away from the center.
This reflects the practical scenarios when a small to moderate amount of generations are hallucinated
while the majority remain truthful. To assign the membership, we define the estimation score as
ζi = ⟨fi, v1⟩2, which measures the norm of fi projected onto the top singular vector. This allows us
to estimate the membership based on the relative magnitude of the score (see the score distribution
on practical datasets in Appendix B).

Our membership estimation score offers a clear mathematical interpretation and is easily imple-
mentable in practical applications. Furthermore, the definition of score can be generalized to lever-
age a subspace of k orthogonal singular vectors:

ζi = 1

k

k
X

j=1
σj · ⟨fi, vj⟩2 ,
(7)

where vj is the jth column of V, and σj is the corresponding singular value. k is the number
of spanning directions in the subspace. The intuition is that hallucinated samples can be captured
by a small subspace, allowing them to be distinguished from the truthful samples. We show in
Section 4.4 that leveraging subspace with multiple components can capture the truthfulness encoded
in LLM activations more effectively than a single direction.

3.3
Truthfulness Classifier

Based on the procedure in Section 3.2, we denote H = {exi ∈M : ζi > T} as the (potentially
noisy) set of hallucinated samples and T = {exi ∈M : ζi ≤T} as the candidate truthful set. We

4


---Page Break---
then train a truthfulness classifier gθ that optimizes for the separability between the two sets. In
particular, our training objective can be viewed as minimizing the following risk, so that sample ex
from T is predicted as positive and vice versa.

RH,T (gθ) = R+
T (gθ) + R−
H(gθ)
= Eex∈T 1{gθ(ex) ≤0} + Eex∈H 1{gθ(ex) > 0}.
(8)

To make the 0/1 loss tractable, we replace it with the binary sigmoid loss, a smooth approximation of
the 0/1 loss. During test time, we leverage the trained classifier for hallucination detection with the

truthfulness scoring function of S(x′) =
egθ(x′)

1+egθ(x′) , where x′ is the test data. Based on the scoring
function, the hallucination detector is Gλ(x′) = 1{S(x′) ≥λ}, where 1 indicates the positive class
(truthful) and 0 indicates otherwise.

Experiments

In this section, we present empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our method on various
hallucination detection tasks. We describe the setup in Section 4.1, followed by the results and
comprehensive analysis in Section 4.2–Section 4.4.

4.1
Setup

Datasets and models. We consider four generative question-answering (QA) tasks for evaluation,
including two open-book conversational QA datasets COQA [37] and TRUTHFULQA [29] (genera-
tion track), closed-book QA dataset TRIVIAQA [20], and reading comprehension dataset TYDIQA-
GP (English) [9]. Specifically, we have 817 and 3,696 QA pairs for TRUTHFULQA and TYDIQA-
GP datasets, respectively, and follow [30] to utilize the development split of COQA with 7,983
QA pairs, and the deduplicated validation split of the TRIVIAQA (rc.nocontext subset) with 9,960
QA pairs. We reserve 25% of the available QA pairs for testing and 100 QA pairs for validation,
and the remaining questions are used to simulate the unlabeled generations in the wild. By default,
the generations are based on greedy sampling, which predicts the most probable token. Additional
sampling strategies are studied in Appendix E.

We evaluate our method using two families of models: LLaMA-2-chat-7B & 13B [45] and OPT-
6.7B & 13B [50], which are popularly adopted public foundation models with accessible internal
representations. Following the convention, we use the pre-trained weights and conduct zero-shot
inference in all cases. More dataset and inference details are provided in Appendix A.

Baselines.
We compare our approach with a comprehensive collection of baselines, categorized
as follows: (1) uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches–Perplexity [38], Length-
Normalized Entropy (LN-entropy) [31] and Semantic Entropy [23]; (2) consistency-based methods–
Lexical Similarity [30], SelfCKGPT [32] and EigenScore [6]; (3) prompting-based strategies–
Verbalize [28] and Self-evaluation [21]; and (4) knowledge discovery-based method Contrast-
Consistent Search (CCS) [5]. To ensure a fair comparison, we assess all baselines on identical
test data, employing the default experimental configurations as outlined in their respective papers.
We discuss the implementation details for baselines in Appendix A.

Evaluation.
Consistent with previous studies [32, 23], we evaluate the effectiveness of all methods
by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC), which measures the perfor-
mance of a binary classifier under varying thresholds. The generation is deemed truthful when the
similarity score between the generation and the ground truth exceeds a given threshold of 0.5. We
follow Lin et al. [29] and use the BLUERT [40] to measure the similarity, a learned metric built upon
BERT [11] and is augmented with diverse lexical and semantic-level supervision signals. Addition-
ally, we show the results are robust under a different similarity measure ROUGE [27] following
Kuhn et al. [23] in Appendix D, which is based on substring matching.

Implementation details.
Following [23], we generate the most likely answer by beam search
with 5 beams for evaluation, and use multinomial sampling to generate 10 samples per question
with a temperature of 0.5 for baselines that require multiple generations. Following literature [6, 2],

All values are percentages (AUROC). “Single sampling” indicates whether the approach requires multiple

we prepend the question to the generated answer and use the last-token embedding to identify the
subspace and train the truthfulness classifier. The truthfulness classifier gθ is a two-layer MLP with
ReLU non-linearity and an intermediate dimension of 1,024. We train gθ for 50 epochs with SGD
optimizer, an initial learning rate of 0.05, cosine learning rate decay, batch size of 512, and weight
decay of 3e-4. The layer index for representation extraction, the number of singular vectors k, and
the filtering threshold T are determined using the separate validation set.

4.2
Main Results

As shown in Table 1, we compare our method HaloScope with competitive hallucination detec-
tion methods, where HaloScope outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin in both
LLaMA-2-7b-chat and OPT-6.7b models. We observe that HaloScope outperforms uncertainty-
based and consistency-based baselines, exhibiting 16.47% and 26.71% improvement over Semantic
Entropy and EigenScore on the challenging TRUTHFULQA task. From a computation perspective,
uncertainty-based and consistency-based approaches typically require sampling multiple genera-
tions per question during testing time, incurring an aggregate time complexity O(Km2) where K is
the number of repeated sampling, and m is the number of generated tokens. In contrast, HaloScope
does not require sampling multiple generations and thus is significantly more efficient in inference,
with a standard complexity O(m2) for transformer-based sequence generation. We also notice that
prompting language models to assess the factuality of their generations is not effective because of
the overconfidence issue discussed in prior work [54]. Lastly, we compare HaloScope with CCS [5],
which trains a binary truthfulness classifier to satisfy logical consistency properties, such that a
statement and its negation have opposite truth values. Different from our framework, CCS does not
leverage LLM generations but instead human-written answers, and does not involve a membership
estimation process. For a fair comparison, we implemented an improved version CCS*, which trains
the binary classifier using the LLM generations (the same as those in HaloScope). The result shows
that HaloScope significantly outperforms CCS∗, suggesting the advantage of our membership esti-
mation score. Moreover, we find that CCS∗performs better than CCS in most cases. This highlights
the importance of harnessing LLM generations for hallucination detection, which better captures the
distribution of model-generated content than human-written data.

Robustness to Practical Challenge

HaloScope is a practical framework that may face real-world challenges. In this section, we explore
how well HaloScope deals with different data distributions, and its scalability to larger LLMs.

Does HaloScope generalize across varying data distributions?
We explore whether HaloScope
can effectively generalize to different data distributions. This investigation involves directly ap-
plying the extracted subspace from one dataset (referred to as the source (s)) and computing the
membership assignment score on different datasets (referred to as the target (t)) for truthfulness
classifier training. The results depicted in Figure 3 (a) showcase the robust transferability of our
approach HaloScope across diverse datasets. Notably, HaloScope achieves a hallucination detection
AUROC of 76.26% on TRUTHFULQA when the subspace is extracted from the TRIVIAQA dataset,
demonstrating performance close to that obtained directly from TRUTHFULQA (78.64%). This
strong transferability underscores the potential of our method to facilitate real-world LLM applica-
tions, particularly in scenarios where user prompts may undergo domain shifts. In such contexts,
HaloScope remains highly effective in detecting hallucinations, offering flexibility and adaptability.

HaloScope scales effectively to larger LLMs.
To illustrate effectiveness with larger LLMs, we
evaluate our approach on the LLaMA-2-13b-chat and OPT-13b models. The results of our method
HaloScope, presented in Table 2, not only surpass two competitive baselines but also exhibit im-
provement over results obtained with smaller LLMs. For instance, HaloScope achieves an AUROC
of 82.41% on the TruthfulQA dataset for the OPT-13b model, compared to 73.17% for the OPT-6.7b
model, representing a direct 9.24% improvement.

Ablation Study

In this section, we conduct a series of in-depth analyses to understand the various design choices for
our algorithm HaloScope. Additional ablation studies are discussed in Appendix C-G.

How do different layers impact HaloScope’s performance?
In Figure 3 (c), we delve into
hallucination detection using representations extracted from different layers within the LLM. The
AUROC values of truthful/hallucinated classification are evaluated based on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat
model. All other configurations are kept the same as our main experimental setting. We observe a
notable trend that the hallucination detection performance initially increases from the top to middle
layers (e.g., 8-14th layers), followed by a subsequent decline. This trend suggests a gradual capture
of contextual information by LLMs in the first few layers, followed by a tendency towards overcon-
fidence in the final layers due to the autoregressive training objective aimed at vocabulary mapping.
This observation echoes prior findings that indicate representations at intermediate layers [6, 2] are
the most effective for downstream tasks.

Where to extract embeddings from multi-head attention?
Moving forward, we investigate the
multi-head attention (MHA) architecture’s effect on representing hallucination. Specifically, the
MHA can be conceptually expressed as:

fi+1 = fi + Qi Attni(fi),
(9)

where fi denotes the output of the i-th transformer block, Attni(fi) denotes the output of the self-
attention module in the i-th block, and Qi is the weight of the feedforward layer. Consequently,
we evaluate the hallucination detection performance utilizing representations from three different
locations within the MHA architecture, as delineated in Table 3.

Table 3: Hallucination detection results on different representation locations of multi-head attention.
We observe that the LLaMA model tends to encode the hallucination information mostly in the
output of the transformer block while the most effective location for OPT models is the output of the
feedforward layer, and we implement our hallucination detection algorithm based on this observation
for our main results in Section 4.2.

Ablation on different design choices of membership score.
We systematically explore different
design choices for the scoring function (Equation 7) aimed at distinguishing between truthful and
untruthful generations within unlabeled data. Specifically, we investigate the following aspects: (1)
The impact of the number of subspace components k; (2) The significance of the weight coefficient
associated with the singular value σ in the scoring function; and (3) A comparison between score
calculation based on the best individual LLM layer versus summing up layer-wise scores. Figure 3
(b) depicts the hallucination detection performance with varying k values (ranging from 1 to 10).
Overall, we observe superior performance with a moderate value of k. These findings align with
our assumption that hallucinated samples may be represented by a small subspace, suggesting that
only a few key directions in the activation space are capable of distinguishing hallucinated samples
from truthful ones. Additionally, we present results obtained from LLaMA and OPT models when
employing a non-weighted scoring function (σj = 1 in Equation 7) in Table 4. We observe that the
scoring function weighted by the singular value outperforms the non-weighted version, highlighting
the importance of prioritizing top singular vectors over others. Lastly, summing up layer-wise scores
results in significantly worse detection performance, which can be explained by the low separability
between truthful and hallucinated data in the top and bottom layers of LLMs.

What if directly using the membership score for detec-

Figure 4 showcases the performance of directly
detecting hallucination using the score defined in Equa-
tion 7, which involves projecting the representation of a
test sample to the extracted subspace and bypasses the
training of the binary classifier as detailed in Section 3.3.
On all four datasets, HaloScope demonstrates superior
performance compared to this direct projection approach
on LLaMA, highlighting the efficacy of leveraging unla-
beled data for training and the enhanced generalizability
of the truthfulness classifier.

Comparison with training on labeled data.
We fur-
ther benchmark our approach against a supervised ora-
cle, where each generation in M is explicitly labeled as
truthful or hallucinated similar to [2, 13, 26], and a binary
classifier is trained based on representations of the labeled
data. This enables us to assess the performance gap be-
tween HaloScope and the upper bound. In Figure 5, we
compare our approach with the supervised oracle on the
same test set and report the AUROC metric. The results,
based on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model, demonstrate that
our method achieves hallucination detection accuracy on TRUTHFULQA (AUROC: 78.64%) that fa-
vorably matches the performance of the supervised oracle (AUROC: 81.04%). This is encouraging
considering that our method does not rely on any manual annotation.

Qualitative results.
We provide qualitative examples of the model’s truthfulness score (as intro-
duced in Section 3.3) for different generated texts given the same input prompts during inference
(Figure 6). The model is LLaMA-2-chat-13b and we utilize questions in TRUTHFULQA that can
cause misconception even for humans, for example, Q: Who first started Tesla Motors? We find
that HaloScope can accurately produce the scores that align with the truthfulness of the answers (the
higher the score, the more truthful the answer is).

Related Work

Hallucination detection has gained interest recently for ensuring LLMs’ safety and reliabil-
ity [15, 16, 19, 53, 48, 51, 7, 33, 17, 38, 46]. The majority of work performs hallucination de-
tection by devising uncertainty scoring functions, including those based on the logits [31, 23, 14]
that assumed hallucinations would be generated by flat token log probabilities, and methods
that are based on the output texts, which either measured the consistency of multiple gener-
ated texts
[32, 1, 34, 47, 10] or prompted LLMs to evaluate the confidence on their genera-
tions [21, 47, 39, 28, 43, 54]. Additionally, there is growing interest in exploring the LLM activations
to determine whether an LLM generation is true or false [42, 49, 36]. For example, Chen et al. [6]
performed eigendecomposition with activations but the decomposition was done on the covariance
matrix that required multiple generation steps to measure the consistency. Zou et al. [55] explored
probing meaningful direction from neural activations. Our approach is different in three aspects: 1)
HaloScope estimates the membership for unlabeled data by identifying the hallucination subspace
rather than a single direction in [55], which can capture the truthfulness encoded in LLM activa-
tions more effectively (evidenced in Figure 3); 2) HaloScope trains a truthfulness classifier based
on membership estimation results, where the explicit training procedure brings more benefits for
generalizable hallucination detection compared to direct projection in [55] (Section 4.4); and 3) our
paper conducts comprehensive and in-depth evaluation on common benchmarks, thus offering more
practical insights than [55]. Another branch of works, such as Li, Duan and Azaria et al. [26, 13, 2],
employed labeled data for extracting truthful directions, which differs from our scope on harnessing
unlabeled LLM generations. Note that our studied problem is different from the research on halluci-
nation mitigation [24, 44, 52, 22, 41, 8], which aims to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs’ decoding
process. [4, 12, 3] utilized unlabeled data for out-of-distribution detection, where the approach and
problem formulation are different from ours.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework HaloScope for hallucination detection,
which exploits the unlabeled LLM generations arising in the wild. HaloScope first estimates the
membership (truthful vs. hallucinated) for samples in the unlabeled mixture data based on an embed-
ding factorization, and then trains a binary truthfulness classifier on top. The empirical result shows
that HaloScope establishes superior performance on a comprehensive set of question-answering
datasets and different families of LLMs. Our in-depth quantitative and qualitative ablations pro-
vide further insights on the efficacy of HaloScope. We hope our work will inspire future research
on hallucination detection with unlabeled LLM generations, where a promising future work can be
investigating how to train the hallucination classifier in order to generalize well with a distribution
shift between the unlabeled data and the test data.

Implementation details for baselines. For Perplexity method [38], we follow the implementation
here1, and calculate the average perplexity score in terms of the generated tokens. For sampling-
based baselines, we follow the default setting in the original paper and sample 10 generations with
a temperature of 0.5 to estimate the uncertainty score. Specifically, for Lexical Similarity [30], we
use the Rouge-L as the similarity metric, and for SelfCKGPT [32], we adopt the NLI version as
recommended in their codebase2, which is a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model to measure the
probability of “entailment” or “contradiction” between the most-likely generation and the sampled
generations. For promoting-based baselines, we adopt the following prompt for Verbalize [28] on
the open-book QA datasets:

Q: [question] A:[answer]. \n The proposed answer is true with a confidence value (0-100) of ,

and the prompt of

Context: [Context] Q: [question] A:[answer]. \n The proposed answer is true with a confidence
value (0-100) of ,

for datasets with context. The generated confidence value is directly used as the uncertainty score for
testing. For the Self-evaluation approach [21], we follow the original paper and utilize the prompt
for the open-book QA task as follows:

Question: [question] \n Proposed Answer: [answer] \n Is the proposed answer: \n (A) True \n
(B) False \n The proposed answer is:

For datasets with context, we have the prompt of:

Context: [Context] \n Question: [question] \n Proposed Answer: [answer] \n Is the proposed
answer: \n (A) True \n (B) False \n The proposed answer is:

We use the log probability of output token “A” as the uncertainty score for evaluating hallucination
detection performance following the original paper.

We show in Figure 7 the distribution of the membership

per) for the truthful and hallucinations in the unlabeled
LLM generations of TYDIQA-GP. Specifically, we vi-
sualize the score calculated using the LLM representa-
tions from the 14-th layer of LLaMA-2-chat-7b.
The
result demonstrates a reasonable separation between the
two types of data, and can benefit the downstream train-
ing of the truthfulness classifier.

Results with Rouge-L

In our main paper, the generation is deemed truthful when the BLUERT score between the gener-
ation and the ground truth exceeds a given threshold. In this ablation, we show that the results are
robust under a different similarity measure Rouge-L, following [23, 6]. Consistent with Section 4.1,
the threshold is set to be 0.5. With the same experimental setup, the results on the LLaMA-2-7b-chat
model are shown in Table 5, where the effectiveness of our approach still holds.

Results with a Different Dataset Split

We verify the performance of our approach using a different random split of the dataset. Consistent
with our main experiment, we randomly split 25% of the available QA pairs for testing using a dif-
ferent seed. HaloScope can achieve similar hallucination detection performance to the results in our
main Table 1. For example, on the LLaMA-2-chat-7b model, our method achieves an AUROC of
76.39% and 94.89% on TRUTHFULQA and TYDIQA-GP datasets, respectively (Table 6). Mean-
while, HaloScope is able to outperform the baselines as well, which shows the statistical significance
of our approach.

E
Ablation on Sampling Strategies

We evaluate the hallucination detection result when HaloScope identifies the hallucination subspace
using LLM generations under different sampling strategies. In particular, our main results are ob-
tained based on beam search, i.e., greedy sampling, which generates the next token based on the
maximum likelihood. In addition, we compare with multinomial sampling with a temperature of

16


---Page Break---
0.5. Specifically, we sample one answer for each question and extract their embeddings for sub-
space identification (Section 3.2), and then keep the truthfulness classifier training the same as in
Section 3.3 for test-time hallucinations detection. The comparison in Table 7 shows similar perfor-
mance between the two sampling strategies, with greedy sampling being slightly better.

Results with Less Unlabeled Data
In this section, we ablate on the effect of the number of unlabeled LLM generations N. Specifically,
on TRUTHFULQA, we randomly sample 100-500 generations from the current unlabeled split of the
dataset (N=512) with an interval of 100, where the corresponding experimental result on LLaMA-
2-chat-7b model is presented in Table 8. We observe that the hallucination detection performance
slightly degrades when N decreases. Given that unlabeled data is easy and cheap to collect in
practice, our results suggest that it’s more desirable to leverage a sufficiently large sample size.

Results of Using Other Uncertainty Scores for Filtering
We compare our HaloScope with training the truthfulness classifier by membership estimation with
other uncertainty estimation scores. We follow the same setting as HaloScope and select the thresh-
old T and other key hyperparameters using the same validation set. The comparison is shown in
Table 9, where the stronger performance of HaloScope vs. using other uncertainty scores for train-
ing can precisely highlight the benefits of our membership estimation approach by the hallucination
subspace. The model we use is LLaMA-2-chat-7b.

Results on Additional Tasks

We evaluate our approach on two additional tasks, which are (1) text continuation and (2) text
summarization tasks. For text continuation, following [32], we use LLM-generated articles for
a specific concept from the WikiBio dataset. We evaluate under the sentence-level hallucination
detection task and split the entire 1,908 sentences in a 3:1 ratio for unlabeled generations and test
data. (The other implementation details are the same as in our main Table 1.)

For text summarization, we sample 1,000 entries from the HaluEval [25] dataset (summarization
track) and split them in a 3:1 ratio for unlabeled generations and test data. We prompt the LLM with
”[document] \n Please summarize the above article concisely. A:” and record the generations while
keeping the other implementation details the same as the text continuation task.

Broader Impact and Limitations

Broader Impact. Large language models (LLMs) have undeniably become a prevalent tool in
both academic and industrial settings, and ensuring trust in LLM-generated content for safe usage
has emerged as a paramount concern. In this line of thought, our paper offers a novel approach
HaloScope to detect LLM hallucinations by leveraging the in-the-wild unlabeled data. Given the
simplicity and versatility of our methodology, we expect our work to have a positive impact on the
AI safety domain, and envision its potential usage in industry settings. For instance, within the
chat-based platforms, the service providers could seamlessly integrate HaloScope to automatically
examine the factuality of the LLM generations before information delivery to users. Such applica-
tions will enhance the reliability of AI systems in the current foundation model era.

Limitations. Our new algorithmic framework aims to detect LLM hallucinations by harnessing
the unlabeled LLM generations in the open world, and works by devising a scoring function in the
representation subspace for estimating the membership of the unlabeled instances. While HaloScope
offers a straightforward solution to leveraging the unlabeled data for training, its effectiveness is still
somewhat affected by the drastic distribution shift between the unlabeled data and the test data.
Therefore, a distributionally robust algorithm for training the hallucination classifier is a promising
future work.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction discuss in detail the studied problem and the
contributions of our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these
goals are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Limitation is discussed in Appendix I.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means
that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The au-
thors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what
the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the ap-
proach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to ad-
dress problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA] .

19


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theo-
rems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a
short proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be comple-
mented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main
experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclu-
sions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We disclose the experimental details in the main paper Section 4 and Ap-
pendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps
taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture
fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation,
it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with
the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data
is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via
detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in
the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means
that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all sub-
missions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend
on the nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear
how to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to re-
produce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to
construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case au-
thors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

20


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use datasets that are publicly available. We provide the instructions on
how to reproduce our experimental results in the main paper Section 4 and Appendix A.
The code will be released upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not
be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe the training and testing details in the main paper Section 4 and
Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of
detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropri-
ate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the result on a different dataset split in Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

21


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should prefer-
ably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of
Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide details on computer resources in Appendix J.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments
that didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, and confirmed that our work does
not deviate from it.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss broader societal impacts in Appendix I.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

22


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact spe-
cific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitiga-
tion strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our work proposes a method to help LLMs detect hallucinations. This itself
will not pose a risk for misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by re-
quiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or
implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite relevant works for the resource we use for the experiments in Sec-
tion 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

23


---Page Break---
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the pack-
age should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the li-
cense of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documenta-
tion provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can
either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the pa-
per include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable,
as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contri-
bution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should
be included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, cura-
tion, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the
data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work does not involve research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research
with human subjects.

24


---Page Break---
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equiva-
lent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval,
you should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity
(if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
