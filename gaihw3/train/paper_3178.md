Abstract

Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent
models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results.
Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-
error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning
due to their poor understanding of the “real” physical world. Imitating humans’
mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before
the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper,
we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent
planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from
both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior
task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist
the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated
datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B,
and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance
compared to various strong baselines. Other interesting findings include: 1) our
instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM
can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising
potential for further development3.

Introduction

The remarkable advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed a rapid development of
various natural language processing tasks [25, 16, 28, 47, 60, 33]. Recently, multiple attempts that

directly exploit LLMs as agent models to address physical world planning tasks have demonstrated
promising achievements [54, 57, 56, 34, 38, 64, 44]. However, as most state-of-the-art LLMs
are autoregressive models trained with next-token prediction, they lack the ability to essentially
understand the real world, leading to generating hallucinatory actions and performing brainless
trial-and-error in the environment as shown in Figure 1(a).

In contrast to LLMs, humans possess a mental knowledge model about the physical world [1, 18,
17, 30]. When facing a specific task, they will first briefly rehearse the entire process in mind using
their rich prior knowledge before performing mindless actions. We call this kind of knowledge global
task knowledge (a.k.a. environment/task commonsense). In addition, during the task procedure, the
mental world knowledge model will constantly maintain a kind of local state knowledge, representing
humans’ cognition of the current world state. For example, imagine you are in a room and your task
is to put a clean egg in microwave. The task knowledge may refer to The egg is most
likely in the fridge ... The workflows are: 1) locate and take the egg; 2)
clean the egg using sinkbasin ... The state knowledge possibly refers to My task is to
... I have found and taked the egg ... Next I should ... The absence of world knowledge
can lead to blind trial-and-error in the early planning stages when environmental information is
limited. Conversely, in later stages when information is redundant, it can easily result in a confused
cognition of the current world state and generate hallucinatory actions.

The process by which humans handle planning tasks reminds us to develop a parametric World
Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. As humans typically acquire knowledge from
expertise and practical experience, we build WKM based on knowledge learned from both expert
and explored trajectories. Specifically, we first steer the agent model to synthesize task knowledge
from the comparison between expert and sampled trajectories. Then we prompt it to summarize state
knowledge for each planning step from expert trajectories and combine the previous and next actions
to build a state knowledge base. Lastly, we integrate the generated knowledge into expert trajectories
and train a WKM. The agent model needs to be retrained to adapt to the task knowledge. Note our
agent and knowledge model are both trained with LoRA [12] sharing the same backbone.

During the planning phase, we use the WKM to provide global prior task knowledge and maintain
local dynamic state knowledge for the agent model as shown in Figure 1(b). The task knowledge
will be concatenated in natural language form following the specific task to guide the agent model’s
trial-and-error. At each planning step, to prevent the occurrence of hallucinatory actions, we utilize the
generated state knowledge as the query to conduct kNN retrieval from the pre-built state knowledge
base. We then use the constraints from the previous action, the probabilities of the retrieved next
actions, and the probabilities from the agent model to make a weighted prediction for the next action.

We evaluate our method on three real-world simulated planning tasks: ALFWorld [41], WebShop
[53], and ScienceWorld [50] with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs: Mistral-7B [16], Gemma-
7B [24], and Llama-3-8B [25]. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance compared to various strong baselines on both seen and unseen tasks. Moreover, further
analytical results show that 1) our WKM can effectively reduce blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory
actions, 2) our model-generated instance-level knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 3)
weak-guide-strong is feasible, 4) multi-task unified WKM possesses strong potential, and 5) explicit
state knowledge will hurt the performance of agent planning.

Preliminaries

We mainly focus on interactive tasks with partial observations from environments. Following the
task formulation in [44], the problem can be viewed as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP): (U, S, A, O, T ). The instruction space U defines the task and its corresponding
regulations. S is the state space, O is the observation space, and A is the action space. T : S×A →S
defines the transition function, which we assume to be given by the environments. It is noticed that
U, A, and O are subspaces of the natural language space in the language agent scenarios.

Based on the above, the historical trajectory ht that consists of a list of actions and observations at
time t can be represented as:
ht = (u, a0, o0, a1, o1, . . . , at, ot),
(1)
where u ∈U is the task instruction and a ∈A, o ∈O are the action and the observation. Given a
task, the language agent with parameter θ serves as the policy model πθ responsible for generating

the action at+1 based on ht at each time step t + 1:

at+1 ∼πθ(·|ht).
(2)

Specifically, a0 ∼πθ(·|u) is generated according to the task instruction u. The whole trajectory τ
concludes when the task is completed or exceeds the maximum time steps. Then the production of
the entire trajectory with time length n can be modeled as:

πθ(τ|u) =

n
Y

t=0
πθ(at+1|ht)πθ(a0|u).
(3)

Ultimately, the final reward r(u, τ) ∈[0, 1] representing the task completion rate is calculated. Note
that we follow a REACT-style [54] trajectory that includes rationales before each action. We use a to
represent the action with rationales for convenience.

World Knowledge Model.
World knowledge model serves as humans’ mental cognition of the
physical environment, more intricate than the word knowledge model which LLM-powered agent
models are trained to be [61, 10, 52, 13]. Our “world” here refers to the simulated environment of the
task. Based on the static environment of the task and the dynamic changes during interaction with the
agent, we define world knowledge as a combination of prior global knowledge and dynamic local
knowledge, corresponding to the blind trial-and-error problem in global planning and the hallucinatory
action issue in local planning in traditional agent models, respectively. To attain precise and efficient
agent planning, we develop a parametric WKM to simulate the mental WKM of humans.

3
Method

As shown in Figure 2, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize the task knowledge from the
comparison of expert and sampled trajectories (§3.1). Then we prompt the agent model to self-
summarize the state knowledge based on historical behavior and construct a state knowledge base
(§3.2). The generated knowledge will be integrated into the expert trajectories for training the WKM.
After the training process (§3.3), we augment the agent model with the world knowledge model to
achieve effective and accurate planning (§3.4).

3.1
Task Knowledge Synthesis

The task knowledge serves as the prior knowledge to guide the agent model’s global planning and
prevent it from dropping into blind trial-and-error.

---Page Break---
Experienced Agent Exploration.
We primarily acquire task knowledge through the comparison of
preference trajectories (chosen vs. rejected). In order to improve the quality of rejected trajectories
and obtain more targeted task knowledge, we employ an experienced agent for exploration. Firstly, we
train a vanilla language model with expert trajectories4 from the training set to obtain an experienced
agent. Subsequently, the experienced agent explores the training set tasks again to generate rejected
trajectories. Our purpose is to extract superior task knowledge that cannot be acquired solely through
supervised fine-tuning on chosen trajectories, thus further effectively boosting the agent’s capabilities.

Self Knowledge Synthesis.
With the expert trajectories as the chosen ones and the trajectories
sampled from the experienced agent as the rejected ones, we prompt the agent model itself to
synthesize the task knowledge. Supposing K is the task knowledge space:

κ ∼πθ(·|ρTaskKnow, u, τw, τl),
(4)

where κ ∈K is the task knowledge, ρTaskKnow stands for the prompt to instruct the task knowledge
extraction, and τw, τl are the chosen and rejected trajectories respectively. Note that given the same
task u, τw and τl always satisfy r(u, τw) = 1 ≥r(u, τl). Even when r(u, τw) = r(u, τl), we still
consider trajectories sampled from the experienced agent as rejected ones. This is because expert
trajectories often have shorter step lengths, enabling the agent to learn more knowledge of efficient
planning. For detailed prompts of task knowledge synthesis, please refer to Appendix I.1.

3.2
State Knowledge Summarization

The state knowledge serves as the dynamic knowledge to constrain the agent model’s local planning
and prevent it from generating hallucinatory actions. We prompt the agent model to self-summarize
state knowledge at each planning step based on the expert trajectories to guarantee quality. For
detailed prompts of state knowledge summarization, please refer to Appendix I.2. Supposing the
prompt used to summarize state knowledge is ρStateKnow and the state knowledge s ∈S is a part of
the state space S, the generation of state knowledge at time t can be represented as:

st ∼πθ(·|ρStateKnow, ht).
(5)

State Knowledge Base Construction.
To avoid confusion caused by excessive additional infor-
mation, instead of explicitly concatenating the state knowledge to the context, we construct a state
knowledge base for retrieval (we analyze in §4.3 how explicit state knowledge may affect the perfor-
mance of agent model). We combine the state knowledge st with the previous action at and next
action at+1 from the expert trajectory to form a action-state-action triplet (at, st, at+1). After iterat-
ing through all expert trajectories, we obtain a State Knowledge Base B = {(s, apre, anext)(i)}|B|
i=1,
where apre = at, anext = at+1, and |B| is the size of the state knowledge base.

3.3
Model Training

We integrate the generated world knowledge into expert trajectories and train a world knowledge
model. The agent model needs to be re-trained to adapt to the incorporation of task knowledge. Note
that our agent model and knowledge model are both trained with LoRA sharing the same backbone.
We list the examples of training data for both the agent model and WKM in Appendix E.

Agent Model Training.
Given the expert trajectories dataset D = {(u, κ, τw)(i)}|D|
i=1 with task
knowledge κ generated in §3.1, we train the agent model to follow the task knowledge to generate
actions. Under an auto-regressive manner, the loss of the agent model can be formulated as:

Lagent(πθ) = −Eτw∼D[πθ(τw|u, κ)]
(6)

Suppose X = (x1, x2, . . . , x|X|) is the token sequence of the trajectory τw, we have:

πθ(τw|u, κ) = −

|X|
X

j=1
(1(xj ∈A) × log πθ(xj|u, κ, x<j)) .
(7)

Here 1(xj ∈A) is the indicator function to mask tokens unrelated to actions. Please note that τw
here does not include the state knowledge mentioned in §3.2.

4For details on how to collect expert trajectories, please refer to Appendix A.

World Knowledge Model Training.
The main difference in the training data between the agent
and knowledge model is the added state knowledge. Given the expert trajectories dataset with both
task and state knowledge D′ = {(u, κ, τ ′
w)(i)}|D′|
i=1 where τ ′
w = (a0, o0, s0, . . . , an, on, sn), the loss
of the knowledge model πϕ can be formulated as:

Lknow(πϕ) = −Eκ,τ ′w∼D′[πϕ(κ|u)πϕ(τ ′
w|u, κ)]
(8)

Suppose X ′ = (x′

3.4
Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model

At inference time, the agent model plans on the evaluation tasks with the aid of the world knowledge
model. We redefine the historical trajectory ht = (u, κ, a0, o0, a1, o1, . . . , at, ot). Given a specific
task instruction u, the knowledge model first generates the task knowledge κ ∼πϕ(·|u), then
the agent model starts planning. Assuming the available action set Au ⊆A for the task u is
(α(1)
u , α(2)
u , . . . , α(|Au|)
u
), at any time t ≥0, instead of directly generating a next action at+1 ∈Au
based on ht, we first employ the world knowledge model to generate the current state knowledge
st ∼πϕ(·|ht) and leverage st to query the state knowledge base B = {(s, apre, anext)(i)}|B|
i=1. With
the state knowledge as the key, we retrieve N nearest triplets from where apre = at based on
semantic similarity and collect the corresponding next actions anext. We count the probability of
each action pknow(α(i)
u ) = Ni

N , where Ni is the occurrence number of action α(i)
u in all the collected
anext. Therefore, we get the probability acquired from the state knowledge base:

Pknow(Au) = (pknow(α(1)
u ), pknow(α(2)
u ), · · · , pknow(α(|Au|)
u
)),

|Au|
X

i=1
pknow(α(i)
u ) = 1.
(11)

Afterward, we sample the probability distribution of the first token for each action α(i)
u , 1 ≤i ≤|Au|
from the last layer of the agent model and apply a softmax function to normalize the probability
distribution. We define the probability acquired from the agent model as:

Pagent(Au) = (pagent(α(1)
u ), pagent(α(2)
u ), · · · , pagent(α(|Au|)
u
)),

|Au|
X

i=1
pagent(α(i)
u ) = 1.
(12)

Finally, we determine the next action by combining the above two probabilities:

at+1 =
arg max

α(i)
u ∈Au,1≤i≤|Au|
(γ · pagent(α(i)
u ) + (1 −γ) · pknow(α(i)
u )),
(13)

where γ is the hyperparameter that controls the proportion of Pagent(Au). Based on the above, we
enhance the agent planning by global guidance from task knowledge and local constraints from
state knowledge generated by our WKM. Due to the WKM and retrieval, the inference stage incurs
additional time overhead compared to the pure agent model. The approximate ratio is around 2.5:1.

unseen tasks to evaluate the agent’s generalization ability. The reward of ALFWorld is binary 0 or

dense rewards from 0 to 1 to measure the completion level of the task. For all the datasets, we apply
average reward as the final metrics. Please refer to Appendix B for detailed dataset information.

Models and Baselines.
We evaluate on three state-of-the-art open-source models: 1) Mistral-7B
[16], the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 version. 2) Gemma-7B [24], the Gemma-1.1-7B-it version. 3)
Llama-3-8B [25], the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct version. We compare our method with two prompt-
based baselines: REACT [54] and Reflexion [40]. Besides, we adopt two strong baselines that
introduce rejected trajectories into the training process to learn from experience: NAT [49], learn
from rejected trajectories through SFT, and ETO [44], learn from rejected trajectories through DPO
[36]. Moreover, we compare with a knowledge-augmented planning method KNOWAGENT. We
also include ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [27] and GPT-4 (gpt-4-32K-0613) [28] for comparison.
All the prompt-based baselines are tested under one-shot and all the fine-tuning-based baselines are
trained with LoRA [12]. Please refer to Appendix C for baselines and re-producing details.

Training and Inference Setups.
We fine-tune the proposed approach with LoRA [12] using the
LlamaFactory [62] framework. During training, the model is tuned after finishing the entire trajectory
rather than each step of action. The learning rate is 1e-4 and the sequence length is 2048 for all
the models. The training epoch is 3 and the batch size is 32. We adopt the AdamW optimizer [22]
with a cosine learning scheduler. During inference, we apply the embedding layer of WKM as the
encoder and use the cosine similarity between sentences for retrieval. The number of retrieved
action-state-action triplets N is set to 3000 and the Pagent(Au) weight γ is set to {0.4, 0.5, 0.7}. All
the training and inference experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA V100 32G GPUs within 12 hours.
Please refer to Appendix D for detailed hyperparameters used in our paper.

on various datasets. GPT-3.5-Turbo performs ordinarily on two datasets other than WebShop, and it
even falls behind Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B’s REACT performance on ScienceWorld. However,
GPT-4 exhibits strong performance across various datasets. Nevertheless, our approach, through

LoRA training alone, surpasses GPT-4 on ALFWorld (44.29→73.57 on seen, 38.05→76.87 on
unseen) and WebShop (62.76→66.64). For fine-tuning-based baselines, both NAT and ETO fall
behind our method, implying that just integrating world knowledge for agent models is worth more
than further fussy SFT or DPO on negative examples. Our method also performs better than KNOWA-
GENT which brings human-designed fixed action knowledge and long action paths into trajectories.
This suggests the effectiveness of our WKM which is responsible for generating instance-level task
knowledge and maintaining implicit action constraints. Furthermore, KNOWAGENT’s performance
on unseen tasks is not as impressive as on seen tasks, while WKM can keep its advantage. This
phenomenon also demonstrates the generalization ability of WKM.

Approach Ablations.
As shown in Figure 3, taking Mistral-7B as an example, we decompose
the key components of WKM to examine the roles of the task and state knowledge separately. In a
macro view, removing each module results in a clear drop in the agent’s performance, which validates
the power of our world knowledge. Furthermore, the improvement through task knowledge (w/
task) is more pronounced than that through state knowledge (w/ state), suggesting the necessity of
global prior knowledge for agent planning. A more micro observation reveals that the impact of state
knowledge is more significant on seen tasks compared to unseen tasks, while the influence of task
knowledge is sustainable across seen and unseen tasks. This may be attributed that although our
real-time state knowledge is generated by WKM, the state knowledge base is built on the training
set, which may weaken generalization to some extent. Additionally, to validate our motivation of
allowing the agent to learn task knowledge from both expert and generated trajectories, we exclude the
rejected trajectories during the synthesis of task knowledge, instructing the agent model to synthesize
knowledge solely based on the chosen trajectories. The results (w/o rejected) demonstrate that
learning from the contrast between chosen and rejected trajectories is more effective than learning
from chosen examples alone. This procedure is a little similar to DPO, but we achieve it through
knowledge augmentation rather than directly converting it into a loss calculation between chosen and
rejected trajectories. Additional results can further evident that training a WKM separately performs
better than training one single model together with the agent model as well as using few-shot prompts
to replace WKM for providing knowledge.

Analysis

World knowledge can mitigate blind trial-and-error and reduce hallucinatory actions.
We
compare the number of planning steps for each dataset between three strong baselines and WKM
and calculate the average steps of each method. As depicted in Figure 9 (in Appendix F), WKM

---Page Break---
demonstrates the ability to complete a significant proportion of tasks using the shortest trajectory,
indicating that guidance from world knowledge can effectively reduce the agent’s blind trial-and-error
in the environment. Taking a further perspective from an average standpoint in Table 2, it can
be observed that WKM exhibits lower average planning steps compared to other baselines. As
ALFWorld can respond to invalid actions, in Table 3, we count the percentage of hallucinatory actions
that occurred in trajectories from ALFWorld for each method. The results confirm the effectiveness
of our world knowledge model to decrease hallucinatory actions. Furthermore, it is worth noting that
most baselines show a prominent increase in the average number of steps and percentage of invalid
actions when transitioning from seen tasks to unseen tasks, but WKM can still maintain a relatively
low level. This reflects laterally that our world knowledge can still effectively guide the agent model
on unseen tasks, highlighting the knowledge generalization brought by the world knowledge model.
To see how our world knowledge works, please refer to our case study in Appendix H.

Our instance-level knowledge can generalize better to unseen
tasks.
To further explore the benefit of using a knowledge model to
generate instance-level task knowledge, we carefully survey the task
knowledge generated by our WKM and abstract it into dataset-level
knowledge for each dataset. Then we retrain the agent model to
adapt to new dataset-level knowledge5. As illustrated in Figure 4,
we compare the performance of dataset-level knowledge with our
instance-level task knowledge (WKM w/o state) on ALFWorld and
ScienceWorld. It can be observed that our model-generated instance-
level knowledge not only surpasses human-designed knowledge
on seen tasks but also exhibits even more remarkable performance
on unseen tasks, with the improvement in performance on unseen
tasks significantly greater than that on seen tasks. This phenomenon
straightly reflects the strong generalization ability of our knowledge
model compared to rigidly designed knowledge by humans.

Weak knowledge model guides strong agent model
planning.
In our main experiments, the knowledge
model and agent model are based on the same backbone.
Here, we explore on ALFWorld what will happen if we use
a weak knowledge model to guide a strong agent model.
We choose Mistral-7B as the backbone of the knowledge
model and ChatGPT and GPT-4 as the agent model. Since
we cannot get the token distribution from OpenAI API, we
only apply task knowledge to the agent model. As exhibited in Table 4, the results of both ChatGPT
and GPT-4 show distinct advances after being guided by the Mistral-7B world knowledge model,
indicating the weak world knowledge model also contains knowledge that the strong model may lack.
In the era of LLMs, this inspires us with a new agent learning paradigm: weak-guide-strong. Due
to its lightweight nature, the weak knowledge model can flexibly adjust its parameters based on the
needs of the agent model, which can address the difficulty of large agent models in adapting to new
environments through fine-tuning.

Unified World Knowledge Model Training.
We mix the world
knowledge collected from all three datasets and jointly train one
single world knowledge model to investigate the effect of multi-task
world knowledge learning. Figure 5 illustrates the relative perfor-
mance comparison between multi-task WKM and various baselines,
from which we can observe that multi-task WKM not only does
not lead to performance degradation but also exhibits visible im-
provements compared to single-task WKM, especially on WebShop
and ScienceWorld. Similar to [57, 58, 3] which endeavor to train
a unified agent model and achieve strong generalization ability to
held-out tasks, this observation inspires us with the potential of train-
ing a unified world knowledge model that can be applied to help

various held-in agent models and also generalize to guide held-out agent models. A more daring
idea is whether a unified agent model combined with a unified world knowledge model is the key to
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Explicit State

Figure 6: Performance of ex-

Explicit state knowledge will hurt the planning performance.
To demonstrate the rationality of our choice to construct a state
knowledge base, we explore the effect of directly incorporating
state knowledge into the context of the agent model (we retrain the
agent model to follow both the task and state knowledge), as shown
in Figure 6. The performance of explicit state knowledge is far
inferior to our approach of retrieving from a state knowledge base
and utilizing probabilistic constraints. It even performs worse than
when we remove state knowledge and only include task knowledge. This clearly indicates that blindly
extending prompts with a large amount of explicit natural language feedback is lose-more-than-gain
for agent planning, and implicit knowledge constraints may be sometimes more prudent.

Case Study.
In Figure 10 (Appendix H), we list the trajectories of ETO and our WKM within the
same task in ALFWorld to illustrate how world knowledge functions. The rationales before each
action have been omitted to guarantee a clear illustration. The task is to clean some soapbar
and put it in cabinet. Initially, ETO blindly searches for the soapbar in the countertop
and cabinet, introducing a lot of irrelevant information and unnecessary context. In the later stages
of planning, ETO experiences the hallucination and executes the put action after close the cabinet,
causing the environment to become unrecognizable and resulting in a collapse. On the contrary,
guided by task knowledge, WKM directly identified the possible locations of the soapbar and
successfully found it in the first attempt. Subsequently, WKM efficiently completed the task with
precision, adhering to the constraints of state knowledge.

Related Work

LLM Agents.
LLMs have emerged as a promising avenue towards unlocking the potential of
Artificial General Intelligence, offering robust support for the development of agent systems [48, 51,
8, 63]. Existing works in this field mainly focuses on agent planning [14, 21, 54, 42], external tools
harnessing [39, 23, 43, 29, 32, 35, 46], code generation [45, 21, 31, 11], etc. Recently, there has been
an increasing focus on endowing open-source LLMs with agent functionalities through fine-tuning
[2, 57, 56, 38, 44, 49]. However, these approaches rely on blindly fitting the probabilities of tokens
to learn planning, without having an intimate cognition of the environment. The lack of knowledge
can lead to the agent blindly attempting trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions.

Knowledge Augmented Agent Planning.
Planning [15] is a crucial capability for intelligent agents
to accomplish real-world tasks, often requiring agents to possess rich knowledge and environmental
commonsense. Few works have explored the field of knowledge-augmented agent planning. [14, 61,
5] utilize the rich parametric knowledge stored in pre-trained language models to assist agent planners.
[7, 20, 59, 64] design structured or natural language knowledge to regulate the actions. However,
the above studies require the manual design of fixed prompt templates or task procedures, making
it challenging to transfer across different task environments. [63, 55, 6] propose the automation of
knowledge generation using language models. However, their knowledge either consists of only
global workflow or only local action principles. In contrast, we train our world knowledge model both
on global task knowledge and local state knowledge to assist agent planning, and these knowledge
sources are derived from the model’s self-summary rather than hand-curated.

LLM-based World Model.
World model and agent model often co-occur in the domain of rein-
forcement learning and robotics [13, 9, 19, 37, 26, 4]. With LLMs commonly deemed as the most
powerful intelligent machines constructed by humans thus far, the LLM-backed world models have
been proposed [61, 10, 13]. In our paper, we attempt to self-synthesize world knowledge and train to
obtain a world knowledge model. However, we consider our model to be a world knowledge model
rather than a world model based on the reason that our model is temporarily unable to utilize search
algorithms (e.g. MCTS) in conjunction with the agent model to make predictions about the world
and we leave this for our future work.

Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we strive to develop a parametric world knowledge model (WKM) to augment language
agent model planning. Our WKM can generate prior task knowledge to guide global planning as
well as dynamic state knowledge to regulate local planning. Our extensive results show that our
world knowledge can work on both GPT-4 and state-of-the-art open-source models and achieve
superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Analytical experiments validate that our
WKM can 1) reduce brainless trial-and-error and invalid actions, 2) generalize better to unseen tasks,
3) achieve weak-guide-strong, and 4) be effectively extended to unified world knowledge training.
Potential future directions include: 1) building a unified world knowledge model, 2) learning to
predict the world like a world model, 3) applying to multi-modal agent planning, etc.

Limitations

Despite our best efforts, this paper still has some limitations: 1) Our primary intention behind
designing the WKM is to compensate for the lack of world knowledge in the agent model. However,
determining what a language model knows and doesn’t know has been an ongoing challenge that
remains unresolved. 2) It is widely acknowledged that world knowledge extends beyond textual
representations. While our world knowledge is currently limited to textual information, exploring
multi-modal world knowledge models is indeed one of our important future tasks. 3) Our world
knowledge model cannot dynamically update with the changes of the world and feedback from the
agent. 4) Generating world knowledge can introduce additional inference overhead.

Expert Trajectories Collection

We mainly use the expert trajectories with a REACT-style [54] collected from [44]:

1. ALFWorld [41]. The dataset provides human-annotated trajectories.

2. WebShop [53]. Except for human-annotated trajectories, GPT-4 is also applied to generate
trajectories with a reward larger than 0.7 being reserved.

3. ScienceWorld [50]. The dataset offers heuristic algorithms to search golden trajectories for
each sub-task.

Since the original golden trajectories do not contain rationales, GPT-4 is further leveraged to generate
the corresponding information.

B
Dataset Information

We evaluate our method on three real-world simulated agent planning datasets: ALFWorld [41],
WebShop [53], and ScienceWorld [50].

1. ALFWorld is a household dataset requiring the agent to navigate through the room and
manipulate objects. Except for seen tasks, AlFWorld also includes unseen tasks to evaluate
the agent’s generalization ability. The reward of ALFWorld is binary 0 or 1, indicating
whether the agent has completed the task or not.

2. WebShop is an online shopping dataset in a website environment. It provides dense final
rewards from 0 to 1 to measure the completion level of the task.

3. ScienceWorld is a scientific reasoning dataset which is at the level of a standard elementary
school science curriculum. It also possesses both seen and unseen parts and a dense reward
function from 0 to 1.

For all the datasets, we apply average reward as the final metrics. Table 5 illustrates the statistics of
each dataset.

Compared Baselines

Here we detailedly introduce the baselines we compare with and our re-produce details.

1. REACT [54]. The first approach incorporates Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting in agent
planning tasks with a format of Thought-Action-Observation loop. In our paper, we apply
one-shot prompting for REACT6.

2. Reflexion [40]. A strong prompt-based baseline reinforces agent planning with verbal
feedback. Manually designed prompts are used to enable the agent to reflect on the historical
trajectory and re-plan based on the feedback. In our paper, we utilize one-shot prompting
for reflection and select the first reflect iteration as our result due to limited context7.

3. NAT [49]. NAT includes negative trajectories by employing different prompts during agent
fine-tuning. When evaluating, only positive prompts are used to encourage the language

7https://github.com/noahshinn/reflexion

---Page Break---
agent to generate correct trajectories. As it also follows the REACT-style format, we directly
use the default positive and negative prompts and train with LoRA in our paper8.

4. ETO [44]. Another baseline includes negative trajectories during agent training. The method
contains two training phases, of which the first phase is behavior cloning which fine-tunes
the agent on expert trajectories, and the second phase is learning from failures which further
fine-tunes the agent through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [36]. In our paper, we
remove the one-shot prompt for fairness and retain all the default hyperparameters proposed
in ETO except for LoRA training9.

5. KNOWAGENT [64]. KNOWAGENT is a knowledge-augmented agent planning baseline that
applies action knowledge in the prompt and maintains an action path in the context during
planning to constrain the agent’s action. We directly use the default prompt mentioned in
KNOWAGENT for ALFWorld and carefully extend it to WebShop and ScienceWorld by
following a similar format10.

All the prompt-based baselines are tested under one-shot and all the fine-tuning-based baselines are
trained with LoRA [12].

D
Hyperparameters

The detailed hyperparameters we use during training and inference are shown in Table 6. We employ
identical hyperparameters for different models. The temperature of the agent model is set to 0.0 when
conducting exploration and 0.5 when introduced into WKM. The temperature of WKM is set to 0.0
for all the time. The Pagent(Au) weight γ is set to 0.4 for ALFWorld, 0.5 for WebShop, and 0.7 for
SienceWorld.

G
Impact of γ

In fact, the ratio γ can be viewed as a signal to reflect whether knowledge or planning is more
important for a task. To understand which part of the output action has the most significant impact,
we further analyze γ = 0 (fully trust state knowledge base) and γ = 1 (fully trust agent model,
equivalent to remove state knowledge in Figure 3). The empirical results can be seen in Table 7. It
can be observed that state knowledge primarily serves as a constraint to alleviate hallucinated actions
for the agent model. However, when we fully trust it (γ = 0), its lack of generalization significantly
harms the performance of the agent model.

H
Case Study

In Figure 10, we list the trajectories of ETO and our WKM within the same task in ALFWorld to
illustrate how world knowledge functions. The rationales before each action have been omitted to
guarantee a clear illustration. The task is to clean some soapbar and put it in cabinet.
Initially, ETO blindly searches for the soapbar in the countertop and cabinet, introducing a

lot of irrelevant information and unnecessary context. In the later stages of planning, ETO experiences
the hallucination and executes the put action after close the cabinet, causing the environment
to become unrecognizable and resulting in a collapse. On the contrary, guided by task knowledge,
WKM directly identified the possible locations of the soapbar and successfully found it in the
first attempt. Subsequently, WKM efficiently completed the task with precision, adhering to the
constraints of state knowledge.

Ethics Statement

This research was conducted following the ethical standards and best practices. All our experiments
use publicly available datasets (as detailed in Appendix B), avoiding ethical concerns related to
privacy, confidentiality, or misuse of personal biological information. However, despite our best
efforts, it is not avoidable if someone maliciously modifies the world knowledge model to contradict
the world’s knowledge and leads the agent to engage in unethical behavior.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction do accurately reflect
our paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section Limitations.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

24


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not contain theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 and Appendix Hyperparameters.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include our source code and data in the supplemental material submission,
and we outline the data generation procedure, the evaluation protocol, the training regime,
and everything else necessary for reproduction either in the main body of the paper or in the
appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4.1 and Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the average planning steps of each method.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

26


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have carefully checked the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and ensure our code
aligns with the request.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Appendix I.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

27


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not have high risk PLMs or datasets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have cited all the corresponding papers.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

28


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
