Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demon-
strated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series
models. However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-
to-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phe-
nomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly
degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main
obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token pre-
diction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features
in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the
decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework
to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage
guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt
encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate state-
of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore,
we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.
Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by
the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Trans-
former (LI-DiT) based on the framework. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate LI-DiT across model size and data size. Benefiting from the inherent
ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding per-
formance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well
as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3,
DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. The LLM-Infused Diffuser framework is also one
of the core technologies powering SenseMirage, a highly advanced text-to-image
model.

Introduction

The diffusion probabilistic models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have led to significant improvement in high-quality
image synthesis. With the assistance of powerful prompt encoders such as the CLIP text encoder [6]
and T5 series [7], DALL-E 3 [8] and Stable Diffusion 3 [9] greatly enhance the prompt understanding
ability in text-to-image diffusion models. Encouraged by the success of GPT [10], a series of
decoder-only large language models (LLMs) emerged and demonstrated superior text understanding
capabilities compared to CLIP and T5 series models, e.g., LLaMA [11, 12]. However, methods for
effectively leveraging these powerful LLMs in diffusion models remain to be explored [13, 14].

To better understand the inherent properties of LLMs in diffusion models, we first conduct ex-
periments with the transformer-based diffusion model (DiT) [15] and perform evaluations on the
T2I-CompBench [16] benchmark. Following the design in DiT and PixArt-α[17], the text conditional
information from the last layer of LLMs is injected into the diffusion transformer by cross-attention
layers. As shown in Fig. 2, although LLaMA3-8B 1 exhibits much stronger language understanding
ability [18], it still fails to catch up to the performance of the smaller model T5-XL on the image-to-
text alignment benchmark. Meanwhile, the larger variant T5-XXL achieves a significant advantage
over T5-XL. The powerful capabilities of LLMs in text comprehension and logical reasoning have
not been demonstrated in such a scenario. Based on this anomaly, we aim to explore the role of LLMs
in prompt encoding.

We start with analyzing the difference in optimization target and model architecture between T5-
like encoder-decoder models and GPT-like decoder-only models. The masked language modeling
optimization and the encoder-decoder architecture design endow the T5 encoder with an inherent
ability for effective information comprehension. However, the optimization target of decoder-only
LLMs focuses on predicting the next token with the highest probability based on training data
distribution. As presented in Fig. 4, the pre-trained LLM provides a meaningless continuation to
the given image prompt. It means that the LLM does not focus on the essential elements in the
given image caption and the extracted text representation of LLM is not suitable for summarizing
the semantic information of the given image, leading to a misalignment with the diffusion model’s
demand. Meanwhile, we find that LLMs generally cause errors or omissions in comprehending

objects or attributes mentioned in the latter part of the prompt. This observation is further validated
through a quantitative evaluation. We attribute this issue to the causal attention mechanism of
decoder-only LLMs. In the casual attention layer, each token can only attend to itself and other
former tokens, while the information of the latter tokens cannot be captured. Such structured
information imbalance challenges the diffusion model’s ability to comprehend complex prompts.
Therefore, the misalignment and positional bias significantly impede LLMs from being effective text
encoders for diffusion models.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-infused Diffuser, to fully leverage
powerful LLMs promoting diffusion models in text comprehension and following. First, we explicitly
insert an instruction before the prompt to mitigate information misalignment. Based on the instruction-
following ability of LLMs, we leverage human instruction to encourage language models focusing on
concepts related to image generation, including objects, attributes, and spatial relations. Furthermore,
we propose a linguistic token refiner to resolve the positional bias issue. Such designs facilitate
effective global representation modeling via a bi-directional attention mechanism. Finally, the
collaborative refiner merges and refines text representations from multiple LLMs to further boost text
comprehension ability. These targeted designs provide an effective way to leverage the capabilities of
LLMs in diffusion models.

Our LLM-infused Diffuser can be easily and flexibly incorporated into diffusion models. Considering
the excellent performance and scaling capabilities of the transformer architecture [15, 9], we further
design an LLM-infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT). We conduct extensive experiments to
validate LI-DiT across distinct model sizes and data sizes. Benefiting from the inherent ability of
the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily
surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial
models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. In Fig. 1, We present some
randomly sampled cases generated by LI-DiT-10B.

Prompt Encoding with Language Models

As outlined in Sec. 1, we observe two discrepancies between decoder-only LLMs and encoder-decoder
models: optimization objective and model architecture. Specifically, the decoder-only LLMs are
typically optimized using the next token prediction task while the encoder-decoder models are trained
with the masked language modeling task. Besides, the former tokens in a sequence cannot attend the
latter tokens in decoder-only LLMs while every token in the sequence can attend each other in the
encoder models. Based on the observations, we conduct elaborate experiments to investigate how
such discrepancies affect the prompt encoding capacity of LLMs.

2.1
Exploring the Ability to Retain Prompt Information

During the pre-training of T5 models, the input sequences are formatted with masks, and the model
learns from vast amounts of language data by predicting the masked content. In this process, the
encoder is responsible for extracting information from all tokens in the current token sequence.

LLaMA3-8B provides an unrelated expansion, and T5-XXL repeats the input prompt. LLaMA3-8B
with multi-modal fine-tuning can provide detailed information based on human instruction.

However, decoder-only language models focus more on predicting future information rather than
representing the current text representation, which is misaligned with the diffusion model’s usage.
To better understand the characteristics of how language models encode prompts, we feed an image
prompt into both LLaMA3-8B and T5-XXL to analyze their outputs. As shown in Fig. 4, the output
of T5-XXL is the repeat of the input prompt while LLaMA3-8B generates an unrelated expansion.
This phenomenon further validates our hypothesis. Therefore, even though LLMs possess stronger
text understanding and reasoning capabilities, such limitation harms their capacity for encoding
prompts.

2.2
Positional Bias of Decoder-only LLMs

We construct a benchmark to evaluate the image-text alignment of all adj-noun compositions at
different positions in an image prompt. Following conventional text-to-image generation bench-
marks [16, 13], we extract all adj-noun compositions and obtain their relative positions in each image
prompt. These adj-noun compositions can be easily converted to questions. Then, we input the
generated image and the question to a VQA model to obtain its alignment score. Please refer to
the supplemental material for more details about constructing the test set. As shown in Fig. 3, we
compute the average alignment score and the relative position within a prompt for each adj-noun
composition. We can observe diffusion models with T5 encoders exhibit strong robustness to the
position change, while models with decoder-only LLMs perform poorly in latter positions. Such
inherent positional bias significantly harms the prompt encoding capacity of decoder-only LLMs.

LLM-infused Diffuser

3.1
Integrating LLMs and Diffusion Models

To bridge the gap between pre-training optimization and prompt encoding, we leverage the instruction-
following capacity of LLM to encourage it to focus on image contents in the given caption. Fur-
thermore, we also propose the refiner modules to mitigate the inherent positional bias of LLM text
embeddings. By combining these designs, we develop a framework called LLM-infused Diffuser,
which can flexibly infuse current state-of-the-art LLMs to unleash its strong text understanding
capacity. As shown in Fig. 5, the pipeline of LLM-Infused Diffuser consists of four parts: (1) We
insert the system prompt and instruction before the image prompt to encourage the LLM to focus on
the image contents and highlight its attributes. (2) The image prompt with instructions can be encoded
by multiple frozen LLMs separately. (3) Different linguistic token refiner modules are adopted to
eliminate the positional bias of text embeddings from these LLMs. (4) With a collaborative refiner,
text features from LLMs are collaboratively refined, resulting in more robust representations.

Input Prompt. Inspired by powerful instruction-following capabilities of LLMs [19], we aim to
leverage such capabilities to force the LLM to attend to the crucial image contents in the prompt

these embeddings and provides a more robust text representation. We only show 2 LLMs for simplic-

and facilitate the alignment between the text representation and the text-to-image synthesis task.
Specifically, we propose to insert the custom instruction before the conventional image description.
Such instruction prompts the LLM to focus on critical image contents, such as object attributes and
spatial relationships among objects in the image. In our experiments, we adopt a simple instruction:
Describe the image by detailing the color, shape, size, texture, quantity, text, and spatial relationships
of the objects. As shown in Fig. 4, the LLM tends to generate contents that are not related to the
image context if we do not provide explicit instruction. When feeding the instruction and an image
prompt to the LLM, it will follow the instruction to focus on the image-relevant concepts to detailedly
describe the image and provide aligned representations based on the given prompt. The output
embeddings of LLMs are further processed by subsequent refiner modules.

Linguistic Token Refiner. In the causal attention layer of LLM, only the previous tokens can be
attended by the current token, thus it significantly hurts the global text representation modeling.
For example, the last token in the text token sequence can only be attended by itself. To mitigate
such positional bias of decoder-only LLMs, we insert a linguistic token refiner module to refine the
biased output representations of each LLM. As shown in Fig. 5, each refiner module contains a stack
of transformer blocks, which consists of a self-attention layer, a feed-forward layer (FFN), and an
adaptive gating module. For the self-attention layer, we directly discard the causal mask of the LLM
to perform full attention, which enables the representation of the latter token can be attended by
former tokens. The output feature of each layer is controlled by adaptive gating networks, whose
weights are initialized as zero for better training stability. To be specific, we first perform the average
pooling to the LLM representation, then the pooled representation is merged with embeddings of the
timestep t via element-wise sum. The gating network takes such timestep-aware and context-aware
representations as input to perform precise information injection. The final output representation of
the refiner will be jointly fed into the collaborative refiner for enhancement.

Collaborative Refiner. To further improve text comprehension, we adopt multiple LLMs and
linguistic token refiners for prompt encoding and collaboratively refine these representations through
the proposed collaborative refiner. The representations from multiple linguistic token refiners are
separately processed by multiple parallel branches and each block in a branch consists of a cross-
attention and FFN layer. Besides, we use a modulation mechanism to condition each layer of
collaborative refiner on the timestep and text context. This modulation takes the same input as
the aforementioned gating network in the linguistic token refiner. The branches in this module
are connected by multiple parallel cross-attention layers, where the text representations can be
collaboratively refined. Specifically, the cross-attention layer takes the feature of the current branch as
the query, and the features of other branches as the key and value to refine the current feature. Finally,
We truncate the output token sequence, discard the instruction tokens, and mix both representations

by concatenation. This mixed and refined representation can be flexibly integrated into diffusion
models to provide discriminative text conditional information.

3.2
LLM-infused Diffusion Transformer

Our proposed LLM-infused Diffuser can be flexibly integrated into current diffusion models. Consid-
ering the remarkable scaling capacity of diffusion transformers [15], we develop a diffusion model
named LLM-infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT).

Following the paradigm of DiT, LI-DiT takes the noisy representation from the latent space of a
variational eutoencoder (VAE) as input and converts the spatial input into a sequence of tokens. Each
transformer block of LI-DiT contains a self-attention layer, a cross-attention layer, an FFN layer,
and the modulation module. The cross-attention layer can inject the text conditional information
extracted by LLM-infused Diffuser into the token sequence. The modulation module receives the
timestep embeddings and text representation to provide extra conditional information. Unlike the 2D
positional embedding designs in previous works, we adopt a convolution-based position embedding.
After the patchify layer in the diffusion transformer, we directly adopt a ResBlock [20] as the
positional embedding module. The translation invariance of convolutional operators can effectively
introduce positional information to the transformer operators. Therefore, LI-DiT can support arbitrary
resolution image generation without requiring additional design modifications.

Large-scale transformer models usually suffer from unstable gradients and numerical precision,
leading to divergent loss during training. To deal with the training instability issue, we incorporate
several strategies adopted in large-scale vision or language model training. First, we introduce
the QK-norm [21, 22] in both self-attention layers and cross-attention layers. The RMSNorm [23]
layers will normalize the query and key tokens before the dot product computation of attention score.
Such operation enables the numerical stability of attention scores and avoids unstable gradients
from out-of-distribution values. Besides, considering the broader numerical representation range of
bfloat16, we finally use the bfloat16 mixed precision training [24] strategy.

Comparing with Other Methods Adopting LLMs

Our LLM-infused diffuser has significant differences compared to the existing methods that utilize
LLMs for prompt encoding. Apart from leveraging LLMs without specific design [25], current works
can be classified into three categories. The first is that LLMs generate the image layout based on the
prompt, and then the diffusion model completes the image based on this layout [26, 27, 28]. The
second one is training an extra adapter to align LLM with frozen diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
1.5 [4] and Stable Diffusion XL [29] for better prompt comprehension capabilities [30, 31, 14, 13].

The contribution of the LLM-infused diffuser does not conflict with the layout approach. The layout
methods are usually adopted as the controllable plugin in specific areas like visual composition
and number-sensitive tasks. They need to be used in conjunction with a powerful diffusion model.
However, the generation quality of each object in the layout still relies on the prompt understanding
capability of the diffusion model. When generating a single object with a complex description, the
layout approach essentially falls back to directly using the diffusion model for generation. Meanwhile,
the layout can only provide the spatial relationship of objects but can not guide the generation
of complex object relationships such as a boy sitting on the shoulder of a man, while the LLM-
infused diffuser can easily deal with it. The adapter-based methods have not addressed the issues.
LLM4GEN [31] also observed that the performance when adopting T5-XL can also easily outperform
using larger 13B decoder-only LLMs. However, they did not provide any further analysis and directly
used T5-XL as the final text encoder.

and 1 block in the collaborative refiner. In our experiments, we take the text embedding from the
third-to-last transformer block as the output of each LLM. For the detailed architecture of LI-DiT-1B
and LI-DiT-10B, please refer to the supplementary materials.

Training Data. All the exploration and ablation experiments are trained on the ImageNet dataset [35]
and a subset of the CC12M dataset [36]. We assign the text prompt of “a photo of {class}” to each
sample of ImageNet and randomly select 1.3M image-text pairs from CC12M. Following previous
works [9], we mix the original captions and synthetic captions generated by CogVLM [37]. When
we compare LI-DiT with other leading counterparts, we employ a large-scale training dataset with
billion-level image-text pairs, including LAION-5B [38] and other internal datasets containing both
English and Chinese, which enables LI-DiT with bilingual comprehension capabilities. Following
stable diffusion [4], we remove the image-text pair from LAION when its aesthetic scorer is lower
than 4.7. Low-resolution images and low-quality prompts including URLs and tags are also removed.
Specifically, we only sample a subset of 30M image-text pairs from this large-scale dataset to
train LI-DiT-1B and use all the billion level pairs to train the LI-DiT-10B.

Training Details. Following the paradigm of latent diffusion models (LDM) [4], we leverage a
VAE encoder [39] to project the image representation into the latent space. We train a VAE with
8× downsample rate and 16 channels for better image generation [9]. We do not use any data
augmentation strategies. Following the multi-scale training in RAPHEL[40], we group the images
based on their aspect ratio. Only images with similar aspect ratios will construct a batch. For the
ablation experiments conducted on 3M image-text pairs, we train the models with a batch size of 256
and a learning rate of 1e-4 for 300k iterations at 256 resolution. For the training of LI-DiT-1B, we
increase the batch size to 2048 and iterations to 500k. When training LI-DiT-10B, the batch size is
4096, and the iteration number is over 1M. We directly employ a resolution of 512 during training,
and then fine-tune it to 1024 resolution with high-quality data to further improve the aesthetic quality.

Evaluation Metrics. For the quantitative evaluation, we mainly consider the T2I-CompBench [16],
DPG-Bench [13], and GenEval benchmark [41]. We also introduce human evaluations for better

with open-source academic works like SDXL and PixArt-α, LI-DiT-1B outperforms them over all
benchmarks by a large margin. We also compare LI-DiT-10B with DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion
3 (8B), two mainstream closed-source commercial models. The significant improvement further
validates the effectiveness of our LLM-Fused Diffuser.

Human Evaluations.
The quantitative evaluation metrics can not directly measure the artistic and
aesthetic qualities. Following previous works, we conduct the human evaluation to convincingly
compare LI-DiT-10B with Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. Our evaluation dataset
contains 200 prompts with diverse styles and scenarios. The image from LI-DiT-10B and the image
from a competitor will construct an evaluation pair. The human evaluator will compare the image
pair from the perspective of image quality and image-text alignment. The result in Fig. 6 indicates
that LI-DiT-10B can surpass DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion 3 in both image-text alignment and
image quality. Compared with the most popular commercial model Midjourney V6, LI-DiT-10B
demonstrates leading capabilities in image-text alignment with similar image-text quality performance.
In Fig. 7, we show some randomly sampled cases to make a clear comparison.

Ablation Study

Componet-wise ablation study. As shown in Tab. 2, we conduct the component-wise ablation study.
We adopt DiT with pre-trained LLaMA3-8B as the baseline setting. First, we observe consistent
performance gains after introducing the instruction to the input prompt or incorporating the linguistic
token refiner to the baseline. When leveraging both designs, the image-text alignment performances
on two benchmarks continue to improve. Besides, we introduce an extra powerful LLM, Qwen1.5-7B
with multi-modal fine-tuning to verify the effectiveness of the collaborative refiner. The LLM fusion
strategy further enhances the prompt comprehension ability of the diffusion model. These results
clearly validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Effect of causal mask. We investigate the effect of the causal mask on prompt encoding in this
experiment. As presented in Tab. 3, inserting a linguistic token refiner with full attention after the
LLM significantly improves the performance. However, this refiner fails to increase the performance
of the T5 encoder with bi-directional attention. If we introduce the causal mask of LLM to the
refiner, severe performance degradation occurs in both LLaMA3-8B and Qwen1.5-7B. These results
demonstrate the causal mask is a core factor that harms the prompt encoding capacity of the LLM
and our proposed refiner can eliminate such positional bias.

randomly sampled from our human evaluation benchmark.

Effect of instruction. To verify the effectiveness of the instruction, we conduct an ablation in
Tab. 4. First, we find the prompt instruction fails to bring gains for the model that employs a
base LLaMA3-8B without instruction fine-tuning. If we institute the base model for a multi-modal
instruction fine-tuned variant, the alignment scores can be significantly increased. Thanks to the
strong instruction-following capacity brought by instruction fine-tuning, inserting the instruction can
further boost performance. This result demonstrates the multi-modal instruction fine-tuning data
helps the LLM better describe an image and highlight key elements within the image. Besides, the
instruction is able to encourage the LLM to attend to the image contents in the given prompt.

Linguistic token refiner design. As shown in Tab. 5, we conduct experiments on the design of
linguistic token refiner. First, we compare our model with other variants with different numbers of
blocks in the refiner. We observe consistent performance gains when the number of blocks in the
refiner increases. However, such gain is not significant when there are 2 blocks in the linguistic token
refiner. Therefore, we employ 2 blocks in the token refiner to achieve the best trade-off between
complexity and performance. Besides, we also ablate the effect of the gating network in the refiner.
When we remove the gating network, the performances on both benchmarks decrease. This indicates
that the conditional information of time and text context contributes to better image-text alignment.

Effect of collaborative refiner. As shown in Tab. 6, we observe the model with a simple fusion
technique can outperform the other counterparts with a single LLM. Besides, the collaborative refiner
can further boost the performance based on this concatenation fusion. Such a result indicates that an
effective representation fusion method can further enhance the capabilities of LLMs.

Related Work

Diffusion models. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [1] provides an effective
manner to generate high-quality images. To train diffusion models on limited computational resources
while retaining their quality and flexibility, the latent diffusion models (LDMs) [4] project the images
into the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders [39]. A time-conditional UNet [42] is applied
to denoise from the noisy latent input. Please refer to the supplementary materials for detailed
information about the optimization process. The transformer architecture has achieved remarkable
success in various tasks. Dit [15] is the pioneering work in adopting transformer architecture in
diffusion models. Transformer models exhibit excellent scaling properties [22], which support the
training of large-scale diffusion models. Recent advanced models [17, 43, 9, 25, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48] in
image generation and video generation mainly consider the transformer architecture as the backbone.
Apart from the DDPM paradigm, Stable Diffusion 3 [9] and Lumina-T2X [25] leverage the flow
matching [49] strategy to optimize diffusion models.

Text encoder for diffusion models. The CLIP text encoder [6] is popular among various text-
to-image generation models [34, 29, 4]. Under the image-text contrastive optimization, the CLIP
text encoder can map prompts into a unified image-text space, providing valuable information for
conditional image generation. Meanwhile, utilizing CLIP text encoders with larger parameters
and more extensive training data [50, 51] has significantly enhanced the diffusion model’s ability
to comprehend prompts [29, 9]. Imagen [5] observes that large language models like T5 [7] pre-
trained on text-only corpora are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis. Recent
works [17, 43, 52, 8, 9] usually adopt the T5 series as the prompt encoding model. Considering
the excellent text comprehension capabilities of decoder-only LLMs [11, 12, 53, 32, 54, 55, 56],
some works [25, 14, 13] try to introduce LLMs into the designed framework. However, systematic
comparative analysis on T5 models and LLMs is still missing. LLMs with instruction fine-tuning
like Vicuna [57] exhibit powerful instruction following capabilities. The multi-modal instruction
fine-tuning [58, 59, 60, 37, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70] further enables LLMs to understand
visual information. These models have the potential to serve as reliable text encoders.

Conclusion

In this paper, we explore the role of LLMs in prompt encoding for diffusion models based on the
poor performance in the text-to-image generation task when adopting a decoder-only LLM to encode
prompts. Through experiments and analysis, we identified the core factors limiting decoder-only
LLMs as effective text encoders for diffusion models are the misalignment between next token
prediction training and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models, and
the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with the issues,
we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. We further design an
LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. LI-DiT surpasses state-of-
the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable
Diffusion 3, DALLE-3, and Midjourney V6.

8
Limitation and Potential Negative Societal Impact

Due to the limited computation resources, we conduct experiments on LLMs with 7B parameters. In
future work, we will further validate the effectiveness of LLM-infused Diffusion in larger LLMs with
13B or 70B parameters. The potential negative social impact is that images may contain misleading
or false information. We will conduct extensive efforts in data processing to deal with the issue.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model

The optimization target of DDPMs can be defined by maximizing the log-likelihood of the training
data. Given the data distribution q(x0), the forward diffusion process is defined as:

q(x1:T |x0) =

T
Y

t=1
q(xt|xt−1),
(1)

where
q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; √αtxt−1, (1 −αt)I).
(2)
Here, αt is the noise schedule parameter. The reverse diffusion process is the key part of training,
where a parameterized model pθ is learned to approximate the reverse process of the data:

pθ(x0:T ) = p(xT )

The optimization objective of DDPM is to minimize the Variational Lower Bound (VLB), thus
maximizing the log-likelihood of the model. The optimization objective can be expressed as:

LVLB = Eq(x0:T )

Evaluation Benchmark Construction for Positional Bias

In this chapter, we primarily discuss the construction of the positional bias evaluation benchmark.
We used the attributes and nouns provided by T2I-CompBench to construct 1,000 prompts, each
containing up to 8 nouns or attributes. For each prompt, the diffusion model will generate 4
images. We divided each prompt into segments (adj-noun composition). Following the design in
T2I-CompBench, we used BLIP [62] to score the alignment of segments at different positions. When
testing performance, we first calculate the average score within each prompt segment, then compute
the overall average score for all prompts to obtain the model’s accuracy within that segment. We
provide a few samples as follows:

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper discuss the limitations of the work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [No]

24


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not contain theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: We will not opensource data and code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our paper specifies all the training and test details
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not report the statistical significance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

26


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to the appendix

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the societal impacts in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

27


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see Section Experiments

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

28


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Section Experiment
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
