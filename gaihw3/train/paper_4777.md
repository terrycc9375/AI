Abstract

We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision–language
models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics,
we bring to attention several important ﬁndings. First, the common ﬁltering of
training data to English image–text pairs disadvantages communities of lower
socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this
performance gap is not captured by—and even at odds with—the currently popular
evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets.
Second, pretraining with global, unﬁltered data before ﬁne-tuning on English
content can improve cultural understanding without sacriﬁcing performance on
said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a
novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores
the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays
the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.

Introduction

Contrastive vision–language models (VLMs) have emerged as a powerful and versatile method to
bridge the gap between visual and textual information in deep learning systems. They utilize a
dual-encoder architecture to map both images and texts into a shared latent space. Representations in
this latent space are learned leveraging large datasets of noisy image-text pairs from the web. Work
including CLIP [46], ALIGN [31] and SigLIP [75] validates this approach at scale with impressive
zero-shot transfer results across a wide range of downstream tasks.

However, due to the growing range of applications for contrastive VLMs, it is imperative to evaluate
them not only with respect to standard performance metrics, such as their classiﬁcation accuracy on
ImageNet-ILSRCV2012 [17] or image-text retrieval performance on COCO [38], both of which are
Western-oriented [53, 16], but also in terms of “cultural diversity.” We illustrate what we mean in
Figure 1 (a) and (b). When performing zero-shot classiﬁcation on images from the Google Landmarks
Dataset (GLDv2) [66], SigLIP models trained on only English-language image–text pairs (henceforth

denoted en) tend to misclassify international landmarks as similar-looking landmarks located in
English-speaking countries. Note that this is the currently prevalent pretraining approach in the
literature. In contrast, SigLIP models trained on the full, global data (henceforth denoted globe)
identify the correct landmarks.

A similar observation can also be made in Figure 1 (c), where we compare the zero-shot classiﬁcation
accuracy of a model trained on en data to that of a model trained on globe data with its text translated
to English using the Google Translate API (henceforth denoted globe-tl). As can be seen, the en
model seems to be biased towards data from Western regions. Switching to globe-tl data lowers
performance for images from North America and Europe but signiﬁcantly improves performance for
other regions such as South America and Africa that are traditionally underrepresented in AI.

It is worth clarifying that cultural diversity in our context is different from “fairness” and the mitigation
of societal stereotypes. While recent work has shown that CLIP models perpetuate and amplify social
biases and stereotypes present in the training data [27, 7, 2, 43], our emphasis is different. We focus
on improving the ability for a VLM to recognize and accurately interpret visual and textual data from
a wide range of geographical, socioeconomic and cultural contexts, such as physical surroundings,
traditions, customs and everyday goods. Evaluating cultural diversity is critical because it ensures
that VLMs perform well across diverse environments and that they recognize and respect the varied
perspectives that exist worldwide.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study of cultural and socioeconomic diversity, focusing
on the impact of training data source, composition and processing (including translation), using
the recently introduced SigLIP models [75] as a case study. We cover a wide range of benchmark
datasets and evaluation metrics. Amongst our ﬁndings, we show that while SigLIP models trained on
English-only image–text pairs (en) achieve state of the art results on popular benchmarks (ImageNet,
COCO), this ﬁltering disproportionately hurts model performance for low-income households and
regions, and negatively impacts cultural diversity. Crucially, these en models achieve demonstrably
lower performance on cultural diversity benchmarks even after ﬁne-tuning on more diverse and
global data. Conversely, models pretrained on the full, global data (globe, globe-tl) followed by
brief English-only ﬁne-tuning can match and even outperform the English-only baselines on the
popular Western-oriented benchmarks, while also performing demonstrably better in cultural diversity
benchmarks. Hence, pretraining on global data yields better foundation models.

In addition, we introduce the task of geo-localization—based on datasets such as XM3600 [58],
Dollar Street [49], GeoDE [47] and GLDv2 [66]—as a novel evaluation metric for cultural diversity.
We show that, unlike, for example, XM3600 retrieval that evaluates multilinguality, geo-localization
is strongly dependent on the global composition of the dataset used during pretraining.

In line with Alabdulmohsin et al. [2], we focus on contrastive learning for several reasons. These
models have a wide range of applications, e.g. zero-shot classiﬁcation and cross-modal retrieval, and
are being increasingly adopted in critical domains like healthcare [76, 52], and as a backbone for other
models [73, 72, 41]. We study SigLIP [75], the currently best-performing and a widely used CLIP-

style model. SigLIP and CLIP operate on the same principle of aligning representations/embeddings
for texts and images and the difference is only in the choice of the loss function.

Preliminaries

SigLIP Overview.
Given a mini-batch B = {(I1, T1), (I2, T2), . . . } of image–text pairs, an
image encoder f(·) and a text encoder g(·), SigLIP aims to align the image embeddings xi =
f(Ii)/∥f(Ii)∥2 in the given batch with their corresponding text embeddings yi = g(Ti)/∥g(Ti)∥2.
The sigmoid-based loss L(B) processes every image–text pair independently with a positive label
zii = 1 for the matching pairs (Ii, Ti) and a negative label zij = −1 for all other pairs (Ii, Ti̸=j):

where t > 0 and b are learnable temperature and bias parameters.We follow Zhai et al. [75] in most
aspects: we use a Vision Transformer (ViT) [18] for images and a Transformer [60] for text, both of
size Base (B), with an embedding dimension of 768. Images are resized to 256 × 256 resolution and
we use 16 × 16 patch size. Text input is tokenized using a model trained on mC4 [69], a Common
Crawl-based dataset covering 101 languages, with a vocabulary size of 250 k. We keep a maximum
of 64 tokens. We use the modiﬁed Adafactor optimizer [54, 74] for all our experiments with an
initial learning rate of 10−3, reverse square root decay, weight decay of 10−4 and 50 k warmup and
cooldown steps. Training batch size is 16 k. Models are developed in the Big Vision codebase [6]
using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) [32]. Each model is trained on 10 B image–text pairs (roughly
610 k steps) for about 40 k TPUv2 core-hours, so they are compared on a compute-matched regime.

Pretraining Data.
We base our analysis on a range of models trained on different subsets of the
WebLI dataset, a high-volume image–text dataset collected from the public web [15]. Each example
in our ﬁltered subsets contains a caption in the original language as well as an English translation
if the caption is not in English. Hence, we can distinguish between three different dataset variants:
(1) globe, (2) en, and (3) globe-tl. Here, globe denotes the raw, multilingual data with minimal
ﬁltering applied (e.g., removing sensitive and personally identiﬁable information [15]). We denote
its subset that contains only English captions by en. This mirrors the ﬁltering that is currently
applied in several inﬂuential papers, including CLIP, ALIGN and SigLIP, as well as the common
way [22, 21, 67, 56, 57] of using LAION [51] and DataComp [22]. The third and last variant is
globe-tl, which consists of the same images as globe but with an added pre-processing step in which
any non-English text is machine-translated to English. We use this variant to differentiate between
the impact of multilinguality, such as low-resource languages being severely underrepresented [8],
and cultural diversity of the trained models. Since it is plausible that VLMs may not leverage their full
multilingual potential when prompted in non-English languages, as has been observed for LLMs [20],
we report results for both globe and globe-tl in all experiments and highlight any notable differences.
To determine statistical signiﬁcance of our results, we train 3 models each for en, globe and globe-tl
with different random seeds. We perform two-sample t-tests and report the 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Evaluation Data.
To evaluate cultural diversity, we use ﬁve datasets:
Dollar Street [49],
GeoDE [47], GLDv2 [66], XM3600 [58] and MaRVL [39]. These datasets satisfy the criteria
of being of sufﬁciently high quality and collected with geographical diversity in mind, see Figure 2.
In addition, they can readily be used for evaluating contrastive VLMs without a decoder, by supporting
either zero- or few-shot classiﬁcation or cross-modal retrieval.

The Dollar Street (DS) [49] dataset encompasses 38 479 images depicting 289 household items com-
monly found in everyday settings across 63 countries. Each image is tagged with object descriptors
and demographic data such as region, country, and monthly income. Following Rojas et al. [49], we
map 96 topics to ImageNet classes, resulting in a subset of 21 536 images. This subset is split into
training and testing sets (17 228 and 4 307 images, respectively). Notably, object tags (including the
fuzzy matching to ImageNet labels) are not mutually exclusive. We use this dataset for zero-shot
object classiﬁcation and geo-localization. DS has been released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

We also evaluate our models on a geographically diverse subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2
(GLDv2) [66], featuring 1 542 images representing 884 landmarks from 84 countries [35]. These

Figure 2: Data distribution [%] for each of the evaluation datasets, only approximate in MaRVL [39]
based on the 5 languages collected in the dataset. Dollar Street [49], GeoDE [47], GLDv2 [66] and
XM3600 [20] are geographically diverse. MaRVL is included because it focuses on underrepresented
regions, such as Asia and East Africa. By comparison, ImageNet examples are mostly from a few
Western countries (see for instance [53]). COCO has a nearly identical distribution to ImageNet [16].

images serve as the public and private test datasets for the 2021 Google Landmark Retrieval Challenge,
providing a benchmark for evaluating landmark recognition algorithms [34]. We use it for zero-shot
landmark classiﬁcation using the English names of all 884 landmarks as class labels. GLDv2 images
have CC-0 or Public Domain licenses. Annotations are licensed by Google LLC under CC BY 4.0.

GeoDE [47] is a geographically diverse dataset comprising 61 940 manually annotated images
categorized into 40 classes. The dataset emphasizes object classes across six world regions: Europe,
Americas, West Asia, East Asia, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Images were collected through crowd-
sourcing, with rigorous manual veriﬁcation procedures implemented to ensure data integrity. We use
GeoDE for zero-shot object classiﬁcation as well as for geo-localization. Since GeoDE does not have
train and test splits, we shufﬂe the data and take the ﬁrst 20 000 images for training and the rest for
testing in the few-shot geo-localization evaluations. The dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

The Multicultural Reasoning over Vision and Language (MaRVL) dataset [39] presents an ImageNet-
style concept hierarchy designed to encompass a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum. The dataset
incorporates ﬁve languages: Indonesian, Mandarin Chinese, Swahili, Tamil, and Turkish. Both
the conceptual categories and associated images are curated exclusively by native speakers of each
respective language. While the primary task on MaRVL involves validating statements concerning
image pairs, the dataset holds potential for broader applications, including single-image evaluation
metrics. The MaRVL texts and features are distributed under the CC BY 4.0 license. Image access is
provided only for (non-commercial) research purposes.

Finally, Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) [58] is a multilingual evaluation dataset that comprises 3 600
images accompanied by 261 375 human-generated reference captions spanning 36 languages. The
dataset is sourced from the Open Images Dataset [36], with 100 images per language. Quality
assurance measures, including a post-annotation veriﬁcation process, attest to the overall high quality
of the captions. We report both image-caption retrieval and geo-localization results. In the few-shot
geo-localization evaluation, since XM3600 does not have train and test splits, we randomly shufﬂe
the data and use the ﬁrst 1 800 images for training and the second 1 800 images for testing. The
annotations are licensed under the CC BY 4.0 license.

Summary of Findings.
Before digging into the detailed results, we summarize our key ﬁndings:

1. The currently predominant paradigm of directly or indirectly ﬁltering the training data
to English image–text pairs negatively impacts cultural diversity and disproportionately
hurts communities of lower socioeconomic status, exacerbating existing disparities. Its
impact is demonstrably captured by zero-shot classiﬁcation accuracy on Dollar Street,
GLDv2, GeoDE, and MaRVL (Section 3.1, Table 1, Figure 3). This has been known for
vision datasets, such as ImageNet and OpenImages [53], but is relatively less explored in
image-text pretraining data scraped from the Web.
2. The image features learned by models trained on such ﬁltered data are less culturally diverse.
We demonstrate and quantify this by introducing the few-shot geo-localization task. A

3. These performance disparities are not reﬂected by, and even at odds with, the currently most
popular (and often sole reported) benchmarks based on ImageNet [17] and COCO [38].
In addition, we present evidence that benchmarks used to evaluate multilinguality such as
XM3600 [58], are insufﬁcient to evaluate models’ cultural diversity (Section 3.3, Table 1).
4. As a potential way out of this conundrum, we ﬁnd that pretraining on unﬁltered (global) data
followed by ﬁne-tuning on English-only data improves cultural diversity without sacriﬁcing
performance on the popular Western-centric benchmarks. This allows practitioners and
researchers to strike a balance between these otherwise competing metrics. These perfor-
mance improvements across benchmarks are further enhanced by translating training data to
English (Section 3.4, Figure 4, Figure 5).

In summary, we call for a stop of pretraining on directly or indirectly English-ﬁltered data.

Detailed Results

3.1
No ﬁlter for improved cultural diversity

To assess models’ cultural diversity, we report zero-shot classiﬁcation accuracy on Dollar Street,
GLDv2, GeoDE and MaRVL. This evaluation includes tasks such as recognizing common house-
hold items across different countries and income brackets (Dollar Street and GeoDE), identifying
signiﬁcant landmarks and places of worship (GLDv2) and categorizing image concepts (MaRVL).
Detailed results are provided in Table 1. Pretraining on globally diverse data yields substantial
enhancements across all zero-shot classiﬁcation metrics related to cultural diversity. However, these
improvements stand in contrast to the popular benchmarks of ImageNet zero-shot accuracy and
COCO retrieval scores. Given their prominence, it is not surprising that ﬁltering training data
to English image–text pairs, directly or indirectly, has quickly established itself as the preferred
choice [46, 31, 75, 22, 21, 67, 56, 57]. When considering the cultural and geographical diversity of
the resulting models however, a very different picture presents itself with models trained on globe-tl
and globe outperforming those trained on en across all four benchmarks by a signiﬁcant margin.

Indeed, a more ﬁne-grained analysis of zero-shot classiﬁcation on Dollar Street conﬁrms that ﬁltering
to English-only training data disproportionately hurts low-income and non-Western communities;

socioeconomic subgroups. LEFT: Zero-shot classiﬁcation results for Dollar Street, disaggregated by
income level (x-axis). The performance difference between en and globe-tl is larger for lower-income
households. Also, the performance disparity between the lowest and highest income groups is 32.5%

(improved) to 27.4% in globe-tl. RIGHT: MaRVL Concepts classiﬁcation accuracy disaggregated

see Figure 1 (right) and Figure 3 (left). In MaRVL, performance for all regions (except TA) tend
to beneﬁt from using globally diverse training data, as shown in Figure 3 (right). The difference in
classiﬁcation accuracy for different income groups and geographic regions is a worrying signal of the
inherent biases of ﬁltering to English-only data. Removing the English language ﬁlter unsurprisingly
leads to a drop in performance for images from Western countries, as exempliﬁed by ImageNet and
COCO benchmarks, but it signiﬁcantly improves performance for the rest of the world.

3.2
Few-shot geo-localization

The disparities between models’ cultural diversity become even more pronounced when considering
the image encoder’s few-shot geo-localization performance, which we introduce in this work. This
task involves learning to predict the geographical origin of an image, be it at the country or regional
level, with only a limited number of training samples per location. We do this using a linear
classiﬁcation probe on the image representation, employing squared loss and L2 regularization – a
problem that admits a closed-form solution. Our training dataset comprises a constrained number
of images per location, with results reported for sample sizes of 5, 10, or 25 instances. Should the
available examples for a given location in the training set fall below this threshold, we utilize all
accessible samples. Our results (Table 2) suggest that few-shot geo-localization holds promise as a
novel metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs.

Independent of the prediction target being more ﬁne-grained (country) or more coarse-grained
(region), both globe and globe-tl have a signiﬁcant edge over en, as shown in Table 2. These results
suggest that models that are not trained on sufﬁciently diverse and global data fail to learn features
that capture country- or region-speciﬁc information. Another point that is noteworthy, especially
when comparing Table 1 to Table 2, is that the difference in performance between the globe and

Table 2: Global data improves few-shot geo-localization performance signiﬁcantly. Performance
differences are statistically signiﬁcant for all reported results at 95% conﬁdence level (*).

GLDv2 Fine-Tuning Impact

Figure 4: Fine-tuning globe-tl on en quickly catches up with en for ImageNet zero-shot evaluation
while also performing better on GLDv2. Conversely, ﬁne-tuning en on globe-tl does not sufﬁce to
close the gap in performance on culturally diverse benchmarks.

globe-tl models is notably smaller in the few-shot setting. This is not surprising since the standard
zero-shot classiﬁcation prompt templates and object or landmark names are all in English and, hence,
this more closely resembles the globe-tl training data version and does not leverage the multilingual
capabilities of the globe model. In the few-shot setting, by contrast, we only use the image encoder’s
representations and hence the impact of the text tower on the evaluation results is reduced.

3.3
Decoupling multilinguality and cultural diversity

As shown in Table 1, models trained on English-only data (en) perform best on Western-oriented
benchmarks. New benchmarks such as XM3600 have recently been introduced to evaluate multilin-
guality in VLMs. To recall, XM3600 contains 100 images each from 36 different linguistic regions,
captioned by native speakers in all 36 languages. At ﬁrst, it might seem that performing image–text
retrieval based on the English captions or the English translation of the native captions for all 3 600
images could serve as a viable signal for cultural diversity.

However, when comparing our models’ performance on these two tasks, we do not ﬁnd any statistically
signiﬁcant differences between the three models. Unsurprisingly, the globe model performs best
when performing retrieval on non-English captions since the other two models have only seen English
texts during training. However, when evaluating all models on the English-language captions or the
English translations of captions in other languages, there are no statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the three model variants. We hypothesize that this is because XM3600 is derived from the
Open Images dataset, which contains primarily Western images [53] or, images quite similar to what
is already available in English domains. Closer inspection of the XM3600 images conﬁrms that
most images from non-Western countries are likely taken by tourists. For example, among the 100
images from the Arab world, 12% are images of cars. These images do not adequately reﬂect cultural
differences. Moreover, since the original caption language is often English, similar images are likely
to have been included in the en training data, explaining why there are no statistically signiﬁcant
differences between the three models. When comparing retrieval scores between English captions and
English translations of captions in other languages across all three models, we observe a signiﬁcant
difference. Upon further investigation, we found that non-English captions tend to provide more
detailed descriptions of the target image, leading to higher retrieval accuracy. This discrepancy might
not be associated with cultural diversity or multilinguality but rather reﬂects variance in annotators.

Based on these ﬁndings, we argue that datasets originally created for evaluating multilinguality, such
as XM3600, might not be sufﬁcient for evaluating cultural diversity in multimodal systems.

Bridging the gap

Fine-tuning.
As shown in Table 1, improving diversity generally results in a loss of performance on
standard benchmarks. In general, we found that the two objectives typically compete with each other:
in Figure 4, where we take two models pretrained on either en or globe-tl data and ﬁne-tune them on
the other dataset for a short duration. Clearly, improving culturally diverse metrics is accompanied by
a loss in performance on Western-oriented benchmarks and vice versa. This is even more clear when
looking at the correlation coefﬁcients across metrics of over 40 models, shown in Figure 5 (b).

Correlation Coefficient

Figure 5: LEFT: Fine-tuning allows for a controlled trade-off between cultural diversity and perfor-
mance on standard benchmarks. Fine-tuning globe-tl on en is strictly better than ﬁne-tuning en on
globe-tl, but mixing training data in different proportions achieves a better trade-off overall. Values in
percentages [%] correspond to the fraction of time training is restricted to endata. RIGHT: Correlation
coefﬁcients of the evaluation metrics computed based on over 40 fully trained models.

In Figure 5 (a), this trade-off is further visualized. We ﬁrst pretrain models on either en or globe-tl
for a set number of steps (varying between 100k and 600k) and we then switch to the other dataset
for the remainder of the training duration. Each model is trained for approximately 610k steps in
total. We plot the resulting performance at the end of training for each of these switch-over points.
In line with what we see in Figure 4, we ﬁnd that very little ﬁne-tuning is sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly
impact model performance and improve performance either for standard benchmarks (green squares)
or for the cultural diversity evaluations (red circles), depending on which dataset was used at the end.
Hence, if we ﬁne-tune for more than 100k steps, ﬁnal model performance is mostly determined by
the dataset that the model is ﬁne-tuned on.

Notably, it is possible to improve performance on cultural understanding (e.g. improving 0-shot
accuracy in GLDv2 from 44% in en to over 45.5%) without impacting ImageNet 0-shot accuracy by
pretraining on globe-tl and ﬁne-tuning that model on en data. However, the opposite does not hold.
English-only pretrained models achieve lower performance on culturally diverse benchmarks even
after ﬁne-tuning on global data with the tradeoff curve being clearly suboptimal to the one observed
when ﬁne-tuning culturally diverse models on en data. Therefore, pretraining on globally diverse data
before ﬁne-tuning on English-only image–text pairs allows for a nuanced trade-off between catering
to cultural diversity and achieving strong performance on well-established benchmarks.

Data mixing.
Besides ﬁne-tuning, we also study the impact of mixing the two versions of data
during pretraining. Because en is a subset of globe-tl, mixing is equivalent to assigning more weight
to English data. Figure 5 highlights that data mixing is as good as ﬁne-tuning (if not better) in
achieving a balance between Western-oriented and culturally diverse benchmarks. Moreover, it is
applicable in settings where we may have more than 2 different data splits. However, data mixing
entails training new models ab initio, thus incurring higher computational cost compared to ﬁne-
tuning. In our setting, we observe that ﬁne-tuning for as few as 50k steps is often sufﬁcient. By
contrast, training a new model from scratch is more than 12 times as expensive. Table 3 provides a
detailed comparison between data mixing and ﬁne-tuning for similar mixing ratios.

To conclude, both ﬁne-tuning models pretrained on globe-tl as well as choosing an appropriate data
mix during training can be viable approaches to navigate the trade-off between cultural diversity and
optimizing performance on Western-oriented, but well-studied benchmarks, such as ImageNet.

3.5
Quality Filters

We apply quality ﬁltering using an internal model trained on image-text pairs to calculate the image-
text similarity score, in order to assess if our empirical ﬁndings continue to hold in this context.
The model was trained on global data to make sure it accurately assesses quality for global data,
of which English data is a substantial fraction, and its threshold was tuned to balance quality and
quantity. We ﬁlter out about 60% of the data in our experiments. Appendix B shows that our main

8


---Page Break---
ﬁndings continue to hold even when quality ﬁlters are applied. For instance, quality-ﬁltered globe-tl
performs better than quality-ﬁltered en on 0-shot Dollar Street, GLDv2, and GeoDE but performs
worse on Western-oriented benchmarks, such as ImageNet and COCO retrieval. In addition, the
improvement in quality-ﬁltered globe-tl over quality-ﬁltered en is particularly signiﬁcant for few-shot
geo-localization tasks.

Related Work

A range of prior work has studied biases in zero-shot classiﬁers related to a range of sensitive
attributes including gender, race and age [1, 25, 27, 12, 24] and found that CLIP models perpetuate
biases present in the training data [7, 23, 2]. More recent work extends this analysis to zero-shot
performance across groups of different income levels and geographic regions [43, 78]. While several
of these papers highlight the central role of training data and the potentially large impact of design
choices such as the data source or ﬁltering techniques [22] or translation of English captions for
cross-modal multilingual encoders [10, 11, 45], to our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to study the impact
of image–text pair ﬁltering and text translation on cultural understanding in contrastive VLMs.

Contrastive models are usually evaluated on a range of benchmark datasets including ImageNet [50]
(and variations [29, 5]), COCO [38] and Flickr30K [71]. These datasets have been shown to reﬂect a
heavy Western bias [53, 16, 55]. Over the last few years, a range of alternative benchmarks have been
proposed, including DollarStreet [49], GeoDE [47], Crossmodal-3600 [58], GLDv2 [66], GeoNet
[33], Geo-YFCC [19], xGQA [44], MaXM [13], Ego4D [26] and GD-VCR [70]. While we have used
some of these in our experiments, we decided against using others for the following reasons. GeoNet
uses only images from North America and Asia and is hence not sufﬁciently diverse. GeoYFCC
contains images from 62 different countries, but Europe-centric and based on images with noisy
tags [47]. xGQA mainly evaluates multilinguality: the starting point for its creation is a monolingual
English dataset that was then translated. MaXM is an adaptation of XM3600 (which we already use)
to multilingual VQA, which contrastive VLMs do not support. Ego4D contains images from only 9
countries with a majority of the images from English-speaking countries (US, UK). GD-VCR is a
geo-diverse commonsense benchmark, but is a VQA task unsuited for contrastive VLMs.

The closest work to ours is [48], which argues that progress in global data (Dollar Street and GeoDE)
has been much slower than the progress on ImageNet. Unlike their work, however, we study the
impact of the training data mixture, study the impact of translation, suggest a setup where both types
of metrics can be improved, and propose geo-localization as an evaluation metric. We also consider a
broader set of datasets in our study, such as XM3600, GLDv2, and MaRVL.

Limitations and Future Work

While our work highlights the importance of incorporating cultural and socioeconomic diversity
considerations into contrastive VLMs, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, our
experimental results are based on recently popular contrastive, encoder-only SigLIP models. While
our analysis offers valuable insights, it should be extended to generative VLMs [40, 37, 77, 3, 14,
59, 61, 63, 4, 68, 65, 64, 62]. Secondly, our work primarily highlights the importance of utilizing all
available data when pretraining foundation models, but there is potential for additional measures to
further improve cultural diversity, such as via regularization, data balancing, or weight averaging [30].

Table 3: A comparison between data mixing and ﬁne-tuning using identical ratios of en vs. globe-tl
examples; e.g., en 5 : 1 globe-tl for en →globe-tl means that the model was pretrained on en data
for 508k steps and then ﬁne-tuned on globe-tl data for approximately 102k steps.

Thirdly, although our study consciously separates cultural diversity and multilinguality, investigating
their intersection presents an intriguing subject for future research. Fourthly, acknowledging the
vagueness of the notion of culture and cultural diversity, we recognize that our experiments are mainly
comparing model performance across different countries, regions, or income groups. We do not offer
a precise deﬁnition of cultural diversity in the context of VLMs and do not claim to cover all aspects
of cultures in our analysis. Lastly, we do not address the relationship between cultural diversity and
social biases that have been shown to be perpetuated by VLMs. Exploring these connections presents
an opportunity to develop more inclusive AI systems.

Conclusion

This work highlights the importance of considering cultural diversity when training contrastive VLMs.
We recommend that researchers and practitioners move away from training models on English-only
image–text pairs. While this approach may seem beneﬁcial when considering performance on popular
benchmarks, such as ImageNet and COCO, it discards a vast amount of valuable and culturally diverse
training information and disproportionately hurts communities of lower socioeconomic status. Our
ﬁndings suggest that (i) pretraining on the full dataset followed by short ﬁne-tuning on English-only
data, or (ii) pretraining on a mixture of data, achieve good performance on standard benchmarks while
also promoting cultural awareness. When doing so, it is important to acknowledge that there seems
to be a trade-off between optimized performance on standard benchmarks and maintaining cultural
diversity. Practitioners should, hence, carefully consider the intended use case and the importance
of cultural understanding of the resulting model when deciding their pretraining data mixture, also
taking into account unintended biases possibly manifesting in downstream models and applications.
In speciﬁc scenarios, where downstream use is limited to English and multilingualism is not required,
we have found that translating the training data into English is a viable option. However, the latter
approach should be applied judiciously to avoid sacriﬁcing valuable cultural context within the data.

Appendix

A.1
Model Card

Model details following Mitchell et al. [42].

• Model Architecture: The model architecture contains two towers, a vision transformer
encoder [18] and a language transformer encoder [60], both of size B. Models are trained
using a contrastive pretraining technique with sigmoid loss [75].
• Inputs: The vision encoder takes an image reshaped to 256×256 as input. The text encoder
takes tokenized text cropped to the ﬁrst 64 tokens as input.
• Outputs: The vision and text encoders both output a d-dimensional feature vector where
d = 768.
• Intended Use: The primary use is to conduct research on multimodal applications, such as
zero-shot classiﬁcation and retrieval. We use the models to study the impact of training data
ﬁltering on cultural diversity.
• Known Caveats: As noted in several prior works, multimodal systems can pick up societal
biases. While we demonstrate some of those issues in this work, our analysis is necessarily
limited in scope.
• System Description: Models are analyzed in a stand-alone setting and not used as part of a
larger system.
• Upstream Dependencies: None
• Downstream Dependencies: None
• Hardware & Software: Models are developed using JAX [9] and Flax [28] in the Big
Vision [6] codebase. They are trained on Google Cloud TPUs.
• Compute Requirements: Each model is trained on 16 × 16 TPU chips on 10B seen
image-text pairs. A typical training run takes 3.3 days.
• Model Initialization: The model is trained from a random initialization.
• Model Size: Each SigLIP model has a ViT B/16 image encoder and a size B text encoder.
• Training Dataset: We use different subsets of WebLI [15], which consists of images with
alt-texts from the public web.
• Evaluation Datasets: We evaluate the models on ImageNet-ILSRCV2012 [17], MS
COCO [38], Dollar Street [49], Google Landmarks Dataset v2 [66], GeoDE [47],
MaRVL [39] and Crossmodal-3600 [58].

Impact of Quality Filters

To assess the impact of quality ﬁlters on our ﬁndings, we train two models, en and globe-tl, on 1B
image-text pairs, following the same training setup used in the paper. Table 4 shows a summary
of these results. We observe that our empirical ﬁndings also hold in this setting. For instance,
quality-ﬁltered globe-tl performs better than quality-ﬁltered en on 0-shot Dollar Street, GLDv2,
and GeoDE but performs worse on Western-oriented benchmarks, such as ImageNet and COCO
retrieval. In addition, the improvement in few-shot geo-localization for quality-ﬁltered globe-tl over
quality-ﬁltered en is particularly signiﬁcant.

Table 4: Applying quality ﬁlters to SigLIPs does not change the primary conclusions. Filtering
training data to English image-text pairs continues to negatively impact cultural diversity even though
it improves performance on standard benchmarks.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reﬂect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reﬂect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is ﬁne to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-speciﬁcation, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reﬂect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reﬂect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reﬂect on the factors that inﬂuence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be speciﬁcally instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.

18


---Page Break---
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or veriﬁable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might sufﬁce, or if the contribution is a speciﬁc model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufﬁcient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justiﬁcation: We use the SigLIP trainer as well as a range of pre-trained SigLIP models that
have been released as part of the Big Vision codebase [6]. While we are unable to provide
access to the training data, all evaluation datasets are publicly available.

19


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Signiﬁcance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly deﬁned or other appropriate
information about the statistical signiﬁcance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, conﬁ-
dence intervals, or statistical signiﬁcance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not veriﬁed.

20


---Page Break---
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
ﬁgures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding ﬁgures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufﬁcient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: All experiments are executed on TPUs. A single model is trained for approxi-
mately 40K TPUv2 core-hours.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: The paper advocates for the evaluation of VLMs on diverse datasets, aiming to
potentially yield positive societal impacts by promoting more inclusivity in AI research and
development.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake proﬁles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact speciﬁc
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

21


---Page Break---
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efﬁciency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety ﬁlters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justiﬁcation: We cite the original owners or datasets, models, and codebase used in our
experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

22


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip ﬁle.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is ﬁne, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
