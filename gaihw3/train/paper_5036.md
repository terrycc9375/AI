Abstract

Recent advancements in models linking natural language with human motions have
shown significant promise in motion generation and editing based on instructional
text. Motivated by applications in sports coaching and motor skill learning, we
investigate the inverse problem: generating corrective instructional text, leveraging
motion editing and generation models. We introduce a novel approach that, given
a user’s current motion (source) and the desired motion (target), generates text
instructions to guide the user towards achieving the target motion. We leverage large
language models to generate corrective texts and utilize existing motion generation
and editing frameworks to compile datasets of triplets (source motion, target motion,
and corrective text). Using this data, we propose a new motion-language model
for generating corrective instructions. We present both qualitative and quantitative
results across a diverse range of applications that largely improve upon baselines.
Our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in instructional scenarios, offering
text-based guidance to correct and enhance user performance.

Introduction

Corrective instructions are crucial for learning motor skills, such as sports. Without feedback,
people are at risk of developing improper, suboptimal, and injury-prone moves that hinder long-term
progress and health. With the growing popularity and immersion of motion-sensing sports games,
the increasing accuracy and accessibility of 3D pose estimation techniques, and the advancement of
fitness equipment and trackers with versatile sensing technologies, the need for intelligent coaching
systems that provide corrective feedback on user motion is becoming increasingly important.

In this work, we study the task of Motion Corrective Instruction Generation, which aims to create text-
based guidance to help users correct and improve their physical movements. This task has significant
applications in sports coaching, rehabilitation, and general motor skill learning, providing users with
precise and actionable instructions to enhance their performance. By leveraging advancements in
human motion generation and editing, this task addresses the need for personalized and adaptive
feedback in various instructional scenarios.

Recent research in text-conditioned human motion generation has shown impressive progress. Meth-
ods like MotionCLIP [39] and TEMOS [34] have utilized neural networks and transformer-based
models to align text and motion into a joint embedding space, producing diverse and high-quality
motion sequences. These models, however, focus primarily on generating motions from text rather
than generating corrective instructions from motion pairs. Therefore they are not directly suitable for
analyzing and improving user movements based on a comparison of motion sequences.

Research specifically focused on corrective instruction generation is still in its early stages. Traditional
methods often rely on building statistical models for specific action categories, which require expert
experience and are difficult to scale and generalize to various actions. For example, Pose Trainer
[6] and AIFit [11] employ neural networks and statistical models to provide feedback on specific
exercises, but these methods have significant drawbacks: (1) They often require large amounts of
annotated data for each specific action class, making them hard to generalize across different types
of motions. However, unlike text-to-motion or human pose correction (which can be annotated
through simple pipelines [31]), human motion sequences involve temporal changes. Annotating the
differences between these temporal changes is challenging. (2) Many of these methods are limited to
analyzing static poses or images rather than dynamic sequences of motion, reducing their applicability
to real-world scenarios where movement dynamics are crucial.

LLMs, such as Llama [30], have shown potential in generating corrective instructions using few-shot
or zero-shot learning. However, without proper fine-tuning and additional modalities, LLMs struggle
to understand the spatial and temporal context of poses and motions, limiting their effectiveness in
specialized fields like coaching or corrective instruction generation.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, CigTime, for generating motion corrective
instructions. Our method leverages existing motion editing pipelines to create datasets of motion
triplets (source, target, and instruction). The key components of our approach include: Motion-
Editing-Based Data Collection: We develop a pipeline that uses motion editing techniques to
generate large datasets of motion pairs and corresponding corrective instructions. This process in-
volves using a pre-trained motion editor to modify source motions according to generated instructions,
resulting in target motions that reflect the desired corrections. Fine-Tuning Large Language Models:
We fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on the generated datasets to enable it to produce precise
and actionable corrective instructions. By training the LLM on a diverse set of motion sequences and
corrections, we enhance its ability to understand and generate contextually relevant feedback.

In summary, our contributions include:

• We introduce a motion-editing-based pipeline to efficiently generate large datasets of correc-
tive instructions, reducing the dependency on extensive manual annotations.
• We propose a general motion corrective instruction generation method which utilizes a large
language model to translate motion discrepancies into precise and actionable instructional
text, addressing the relationship between language and dynamic motions.
• Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing models in generating high-quality corrective instructions, providing better guidance
for users in various real-world scenarios.

Text Conditioned Human Motion Generation.

Conditional motion generation aims to synthesize diverse and realistic motion conditioning on
different control signals, such as music [25, 26, 27, 28], action categories [2, 15, 21], physical signals
[10, 16, 33]. Recent years have seen significant progress in text conditioned human motion generation
[1, 2, 12, 13, 14, 20, 24, 34, 39, 40, 44, 45, 47]. Some methods [1, 12, 39] align the texts and
motions into a joint embedding space for generation. Benefiting by aligning motion latent to the
CLIP [35] embedding space, MotionCLIP [39] could generate out-of-distribution motions. Several
works utilize other mechanisms to increase the diversity and quality of generated motions. TEMOS
[34] and TEACH [2] employ transformer-based VAEs to generate motion sequences based on texts.
Guo et al. [13] propose an auto-regressive conditional VAE to generate human motion sequences.
Inspired by the achievements in image generation, the diffusion models, such as MotionDiffuse [45],
MDM [40] and FLAME [24], have also been applied to motion generation. Some follow-up works
[37, 43] attempt to improve the controllability of the diffusion model. Recently, the Vector Quantized
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) has gained significant traction in being used to convert 3D human
motion into motion tokens which are subsequently employed alongside language models. TM2T
[14] proposes using these quantized tokens to facilitate the mapping between text and motion. T2M-
GPT [44] employs an auto-regressive method to predict the next-index token. Further, MotionGPT
[20, 47] utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle different motion-related

tasks. Recently, AvatarGPT [48] extends the generation models to unify high-level and low-level
motion-related tasks, which supports human motions generation, prediction and understanding.

2.2
Motion Editing

Motion editing enables users to interactively refine generated motions to suit their expectations.
PoseFix [7] utilize neural networks to edit 3D poses. Holden et al. [17] employs an autoencoder
to optimize the trajectory constraints. MDM [40], MotionDiffuse [45] and FLAME [24] involve
processing by masks that designate parts for editing through reverse diffusion. GMD [22] and
PriorMDM [37] are designed to edit motion sequences conditioned on joint trajectories. OmniControl
[43] incorporates control signals that encourage motions to conform to the spatial constraints while
being realistic. Recently, FineMoGen [46] tackles fine-grained motion editing which allows for
editing the motion of individual body parts, however its heavy reliance on specific-fine grained format
limits the smooth coordination among movements of different body parts.

2.3
Corrective Instruction Generation

Traditional methods [6, 11] focus on specific action categories by building statistical models that
require expert experience. These methods struggle to scale and generalize to various actions. Pose
Tutor [8] uses neural networks to learn statistical models but requires large amounts of data for each
action and can only analyze static images or poses. FixMyPose [23] creates a dataset with human-
annotated corrective instructions on synthetic 2D images. PoseFix [7] designs an automatic annotation
system and a conditioned auto-regressive model for corrective instruction generation, but it is limited
to static poses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) [30] have made significant advances in
text generation. With appropriate prompting, LLMs can generate pose corrective instructions with
few-shot or zero-shot example data. However, LLMs’ access to text makes them less aware of a
variety of possible motions that people could perform and links them with languages.

Our key insight for corrective instruction generation is to regard this task as a close yet inverse
problem to text-conditioned motion generation and editing, allowing us to bring the progress in that
fast-growing space to this understudied problem: We first propose a novel corrective instruction data
collection pipeline based on motion editing. Subsequently, we design a model that leverage large
language models to provide corrective instructions on spatial form and temporal dynamics.

3.1
Overview

We present an overview of our approach in Fig. 1. Given a source motion sequence, xI ∈RT ×D,
where T is the number of frames and D is the dimensionality of the motion representation, and a
target motion sequence, xO ∈RT ×D, as input, our goal is to learn a function T which maps xI and
xO to the corrective text instruction L, i.e., T (xI, xO) = L.

To achieve this, we employ a pre-trained motion editor, which takes as input the source motion
sequence and ground-truth corrective text, to output target motion sequences. Next, we quantize the
source and target motion sequences into discrete tokens using a VQ-VAE-based network. Finally,
we organize these tokens with a predefined template to fine-tune an LLM on the triplets that contain
source motion sequence xI, target motion sequence XO, and corrective instruction L for generating
instructions that can efficiently modify the source to the target motion sequence.

3.2
Motion-Editing-Based Data Collection

The task of generating corrective instructions requires triplet data consisting of the source motion, the
target motion, and the corrective instruction. Collecting such a dataset through human annotation is
costly and inefficient. We aim to leverage existing pre-trained models to streamline the data collection
process. However, there isn’t an existing model that generates such triplets.

Our fundamental insight is to treat corrective instruction generation as an inverse process of motion
editing, which uses a given text to guide an agent in editing its initial motion. We utilize the motion
editing process to gather required triplets: we collect a set of source motions and employ a pre-trained

motion editor to edit the source motion based on a corrective instruction, resulting in the target
motion.

Motion Editing
In this work, we utilize the motion diffusion model (MDM) [40] as the motion
editor. Given the input motion sequence, x, and generation condition, c, MDM uses probabilistic
diffusion models for motion generation. It comprises a forward process, which is a Markov chain
involving the sequential addition of Gaussian noise to the data, and a reverse process that progressively
denoises the data to get the edited motion. The forward process of MDM is formulated as,

q(x1:T |x0) =
Y

t≥1
q(xt|xt−1),
(1)

q(xt|xt−1) = N(√αtxt−1, (1 −αt)I),
(2)

where αt ∈(0, 1) are constant hyper-parameters. Further, the reverse process is formulated as,

pθ(x0:T ) = p(xT )
Y

t≥1
pθ(xt−1|xt),
(3)

pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; µθ(xt, t), σ2
t I),
(4)

where θ is the learnable parameters of the diffusion model, which gradually anneals the noise from a
Gaussian distribution to the data distribution. We train MDM as a conditional generator G(xt, c, t)
that outputs x0, where c is the text condition, to maximize pθ(x0:T ).

In inference, MDM takes noise n as xT and applies the reverse process to denoise the input based
on the text condition, c, generating the motion sequences, x0, corresponding to c. For the motion
editing task, we utilize the corrective instruction, L, as the generation condition, c, to generate the
corresponding corrective motion sequence, xL. We then calculate the target motion sequence, xO, by
combining the source motion sequence, xI, and the corrective motion sequence, xL,

xO = m ⊙xL + (1 −m) ⊙xI,
(5)

where m is the joint mask for the body part P, and ⊙is the element-wise multiplication for masking
operation. Through the above process, we are able to collect a large amount of ⟨xI, xO, L⟩triplets.
We use this dataset to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for the corrective instruction generation
task as in the following.

3.3
Fine-tuning LLMs for Corrective Instruction Generation

With the prepared dataset of triplets from the motion editing process, we learn the inverse process
of motion editing, a function, T , that maps source and target motion sequence pairs to corrective
instructions. We first learn an encoder based on VQ-VAE [41] to tokenize the motion sequences into
discrete tokens and organize the discrete tokens based on a pre-defined template. Then, we fine-tuned
an LLM to generate the corrective instruction, L, based on the tokens of the source and target motion
sequence, xI and xO.

Tokenizer Pre-training
Compared to directly feeding the original data to the LLMs, the discrete
representation has been proven to be more suitable for fine-tuning LLMs with human-motion-related
tasks [20, 47]. Inspired by these works, we initialize a VQ-VAE-based network, which contains an
encoder E, a codebook C, and a decoder D. The encoder E takes motion sequence, x, as input and
maps, x, into discrete features, f ∈T × H, where H is the dimensionality of the frame feature.

The codebook, C ∈RK×H, represents different codes, where K is a predefined number of different
discrete codes and ck ∈RH is the k-th code. VQ-VAE quantizes the discontinuous feature f to the
discrete latent codes, z ∈RT ×H, through codebook, c, by projecting each per-frame feature fi to its
nearest code:

zi = Q (fi) = ck, where k = argminj ∥fi −cj∥2
2 ,
(6)

where Q represents the quantization operation. The decoder D takes the code, z, as input, and
reconstructs the motion sequence, xO′. We use the index k as the token of each discrete code, ck, as
the token representation of the frame feature fi. We apply the L2 loss for the training of the tokenizer,

Lrecon = ||xO −xO′||2
2.
(7)

Considering that the quantization operation disrupts gradient backpropagation, we employ an ex-
ponential moving average (EMA) [42] for the codebook update and stabilize the training process.
Besides, we apply the commitment loss [41] to update the tokenizer encoder,

Lcom =

T
X

i=1
∥fi −sg(zi)∥2
2 ,
(8)

where sg(·) is the stop gradient operation that helps stabilize the training process.

Fine-tuning LLM
Instruction Tuning is a widely used technique to enable LLMs to handle specific
tasks. In this work, we employ this technique to fine-tune our LLM. Specifically, given an LLM, T , a
source discrete token set, Is = Is
0, Is
1, ..., Is
ns, and a target discrete token set, It = It
0, It
1, ..., It
nt, we

5


---Page Break---
organize the input of T to follow the template as shown in Fig. 2. This input is then tokenized into
text tokens U I = uI
0, uI
1, ..., uI
nUI . Additionally, we tokenize the ground-truth corrective instruction,
L, into text tokens, U O = uO
0 , uO
1 , ..., uO
nUO .

The LLM processes the input tokens, U I, and auto-regressively predicts the probability distribution
of the next tokens pL(u|U I) = Q

j pL(uO
j |uO
0:j−1, U I). During training, we maximize the log-
likelihood of the data distribution by applying cross-entropy loss:

LLLM = −

U O
X

j=0
log pL(uO
j |uO
0:j−1, U I).
(9)

By using a structured input template and optimizing the cross-entropy loss, we enable the LLM to
generate accurate and contextually relevant corrective instructions. This approach ensures that the
model effectively learns to convert discrepancies between the source and target motions into precise
and actionable instructional text.

Learning Representation for Motion Tokens
Previous methods for training text-to-motion models
involve either using an existing vocabulary for motion tokens [47] or assigning new learnable
embeddings [20, 48], followed by fine-tuning with techniques like LoRA. We tried both approaches,
but the results of utilizing one of them alone were not satisfying. There are two main reasons: First,
using a fixed vocabulary and embeddings prevents capturing the correlation of motion differences and
corrective instructions, as the weights are trained on tasks with a large domain gap. Second, while
new embeddings can be learned with LoRA, the distribution of the original vocabulary’s embeddings
imposes constraints, making the learned embeddings suboptimal, especially given the smaller scale
of training data for corrective instructions.

To address these challenges, we integrate the goods of both. We use existing vocabulary tokens for
their rich semantics and fine-tune all embeddings to maximize performance and reduce the domain
gap. We also introduce an anchor loss to prevent the embeddings from diverging:

LAnchor = λ · ∥W −W0∥2
2,
(10)

where λ is a regularization coefficient that controls the influence of loss, W0 represents the network
weights before training, W represents the network weights after training.

4.1
Experiment Setup

Datasets We obtain the source motion sequences from HumanML3D [13], a dataset containing 3D
human motions and associated language descriptions. We make use of the entire dataset for the
collection of source motions. We then generate triplets based on pre-trained motion editor with
instructions and target motions. We split HumanML3D following the original setting and for each
motion sequence in HumanML3D, we randomly select one instruction from the corresponding
split for editing the sequence. We subsequently edit the source motion sequences with MDM [40]
conditioned on the corrective instructions to obtain the target sequences.

Implementation Details We fine-tune a pre-trained Llama-3-8B [30] using full-parameter fine-tuning
for corrective instruction generation. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with an
initial learning rate of 10−5. We use a batch size of 512 and train on four NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs
for eight epochs, which takes approximately 5 hours to complete. Following HumanML3D [13], the
dimensionality, D, of the motion sequences is set to 263 for our experiments.

Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the generated corrective instruction with two types of metrics.

(1) Corrective instruction quality: BLEU [32], ROUGE [29], and METEOR [4] are commonly
employed metrics that assess various n-gram overlaps between the ground-truth text and the generated
text. Although these metrics focus on structural text similarity, they tend to disregard semantic
meaning. Consequently, we also utilize the cosine similarity of text CLIP embeddings as an evaluation
metric to better compare semantic similarity.

---Page Break---
(2) Reconstruction accuracy: To evaluate the quality, we use the generated corrective instruction
as an editing condition to modify the source motion sequences and obtain the generated target
motion. We then compare this with the ground-truth target motion. Specifically, we employ Mean
Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) to measure the average Euclidean distance between the generated
and ground-truth 3D joint positions for all joints. Additionally, we calculate the Fréchet Inception
Distance (FID) using a feature extractor [13] to evaluate the distance between the feature distributions
of the generated and ground-truth target motions. Ideally, the generated motion sequences should
closely resemble the target motion sequences.

Table 1: Comparison to the Existing Work.
We compare our approach against large lan-
guage (Llama-3-8B, Llama-3-8B-LoRA, Qwen-7B, Mistral-7B) and motion-language (MotionGPT,
MotionGPT-M2T) models. We demonstrate that our approach, CigTime outperforms all the baselines
by a large margin for corrective instruction generation for human motion.

Comparison Baselines To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate corrective instruction
for general motion pairs. Thus, we adopt two different kinds of methods designed for general text-
based tasks and motion captioning.

(1) Llama3 [30], Qwen [3] and Mistral [19] are all large language models designed for general
text-based tasks. They can be applied to unseen tasks with just a few-shot data. We utilize the
in-context learning technique [9] to generate correction instructions by giving them examples of
the source-target-instruction triplets. We present the detailed prompts in the supplemental material.
In addition to the baselines that use in-context learning with LLMs, we ablate different fine-tuning
techniques. To do so, we compare our approach, which uses full-parameter LLM tuning to a variant,
which utilizes the LoRA adapter [18] to fine-tune the Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B models.

(2) MotionGPT [20]. Although MotionGPT isn’t trained with corrective instruction data, it has been
proven to have the ability to generalize across different motion-based tasks by utilizing specific input
templates for different tasks. Thus, we adopt this method for corrective instruction generation by
utilizing the template mentioned in Section. 3.3. In addition, as generating corrective instructions is
not a target for MotionGPT, we create yet another baseline called MotionGPT-M2T that employs
MotionGPT to generate captions corresponding for the target motions.

4.2
Quantitative Results

Our quantitative results are presented in Table. 1. We further discuss below the quality of the
corrective instructions and the reconstruction accuracy of target motion after editing.

Corrective Instruction Quality
Our method demonstrated superior performance across most
metrics when compared to baseline methods, as presented in Table. 1. Specifically, our method
achieved the highest BLEU-4, ROUGE-2 and METERO scores of 0.24, 0.35, and 0.52, significantly
surpassing the baseline methods. This indicates that our method generates text with higher precision.

Furthermore, our method achieved the highest CLIP Score of 0.82, outperforming other baselines.
The CLIP Score indicates the semantic alignment of the generated text with visual content, and a
higher score demonstrates better performance in maintaining this alignment.

We find that the two baselines adopted from MotionGPT both present inferior performances, which
can be attributed to its training on a text-motion dataset, which lacks the capability to compare

7


---Page Break---
two motion sequences and identify specific differences. Besides, although MotionGPT excels at
generating captions for motion sequences, it’s still difficult to reconstruct the original target motion
sequence from the generated descriptions. This is because describing the differences and similarities
between two motion sequences can help us accurately depict the target motion with fewer statements,
which MotionGPT does not possess.

This evidenced that simply fine-tuning Llama-3 using the generated data would not result in a
satisfactory corrective instruction generation, e.g., due to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting.
Although the outputs can induce similar target motion sequences compared to the ground truth,
the increased variance in the text can lead to a decrease in the overall NLP metrics such as BLEU,
ROUGE, and METERO.

Overall, these results highlight the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality corrective
instructions, with significant improvements in precision, similarity, and visual-semantic consistency
over the baseline methods.

new learnable embeddings for the motion tokens and update the corresponding embeddings during
fine-tuning as baselines. We also compare variants that utilizes T5 as the backbone (ours-T5), and
continous representaion (Ours-Continuous).

Reconstruction Accuracy
The evaluation of reconstruction accuracy highlights the superior perfor-
mance of our method in distinguishing between source and target motions. As shown in Table 1, our
method achieved the lowest MPJPE of 0.1330, indicating the highest accuracy in pose reconstruction.
Furthermore, our method also attained the lowest FID - Target score of 1.4442, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating data that closely matches the target motion. Similarly, MotionGPT’s
inferior performance in these metrics is a result of its limited ability to analyze differences between
motion pairs, as evidenced by its MPJPE of 0.8011 and FID score of 8.8350.

Additionally, although LLM models like Llama-3-8B can maintain text consistency via in-context
learning, they are unable to grasp the intricate connections between motion sequences and language,
leading to inferior overall performance compared to our approach. Even when benefiting from
fine-tuning through LoRA, these models still cannot generate high-quality corrective instructions.

Overall, these results underline the effectiveness of our method in accurately distinguishing and
reconstructing the differences between source and target motions, outperforming the baseline methods
in both MPJPE and FID metrics.

conducted a comparison of LLMs trained using token embeddings, as shown in Table 2. Although
fine-tuning with extended vocabulary can enhance the text-based metrics, these instructions cause
a decline in the motion editing performance, resulting in a reduction in MPJPE and FID. From the
perspective of the task definition, we require a model that prioritizes high reconstruction quality over
instruction quality. Therefore, extending vocabulary is more detrimental than beneficial for our task.

Besides we fine-tune T5-770M [36], as in Motion-GPT [20] and AvatarGPT [48] to validate the
impact of different LLM frameworks on the results. The experimental results show that the T5
framework does not offer an advantage over larger language models [30] in the Motion Corrective
Instruction Generation task. We also compared our method with its variant based on continuous
representations, as implemented by MotionLlm [5]. As observed, our method still outperforms the
continuous baseline across all the reconstruction accuracy metrics.

Evaluation with Different Motion Editors
Different people may perform various actions in
response to the same instruction. Our goal is for our model to produce instructions that are as accurate
and widely accepted as possible. Therefore, we evaluate our methods and baselines using different
motion editors. In addition to MDM, which we used to generate the ground-truth dataset, we also
assess the methods with two different versions of PriorMDM as shown in Table 3.

Our proposed method consistently outperforms other models across different motion editors, demon-
strating the lowest MPJPE and FID values, close to the ground truth. This highlights its effectiveness
in generating accurate and visually similar corrective motions. In contrast, models like MotionGPT
and its variant exhibit significantly higher errors, indicating limitations in their generation capabilities.

4.3
Visual Results

To further analyze the performance of different methods, we present visual comparisons in 3. As
shown in the results, our algorithm largely maintains similar semantics and achieves reconstruction
results that are closely aligned with the ground truth. This demonstrates the accuracy of our algorithm
in generating corrective instructions. In contrast, Llama3-8B, despite achieving favorable numerical
results, may incorrectly identify the joint parts involved in motion editing. This highlights our
approach’s superiority in providing accurate and contextually appropriate motion corrections.

Conclusion

We introduced a new task and a framework for generating corrective instructions that translate a source
motion into a target motion. Our key insight is to leverage the fast growing field of text-conditioned

motion-editing for this related yet understudied inverse problem. To create a dataset for this task, we
proposed a motion editing pipeline that minimizes the need for extensive manual annotations. We
demonstrated the utility of our approach which largely outperforms existing related models.

While our work provides a strong foundation for corrective instruction generation in human motion,
there are limitations to our framework.

1. First, the curated dataset captures differences between source and target motions, but it
lacks targeted feedback on form and dynamics that are specific to actions and sports, which
require more detailed and subtle instructions for learning particular skills.
2. Second, due to the limitation of the pretrained motion editor [40], we can only handle source
and target motion pairs with the same sequence length, without context or scenes.
3. Third, the corrective instruction generation method may be misused to generate instructions
for insulting or inappropriate motions.

We aim to address these limitations in future research, along with further advances of text-conditioned
motion-editing frameworks, which share our challenges, limitations, and potential solutions.

A
Prompt for the LLMs In-context Learning

To enable large language models (LLMs) for generating correctional instructions grounded in given
sequences, we apply the in-context learning technique [9]. This method allows LLMs to make
predictions based on contexts supplemented with a limited number of examples. The prompt used for
in-context learning is displayed in Figure 4.

Additional Experiments

B.1
Generalization to New Data

Our algorithm is fully trained and tested on the HumanML3D [13] dataset, which may impact its
generalization. To evaluate the generalization ability of our algorithm, we collected 1525 samples
from the Fit3D [11] dataset.

We present the results in Table 4. These results show that the BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores
decreased from 0.24, 0.35, and 0.52 to 0.03, 0.05, and 0.20, respectively. This indicates that when the
dataset changes, the corrective instructions generated by our algorithm deviate from the ground truth
in form. However, the changes in CLIP score, MPJPE, and FID are subtle. This suggests that even
after switching datasets, our algorithm can still effectively capture the differences in motion pairs and
describe them in appropriate language. Our algorithm therefore generally showcases a notable level
of generalization capability.

B.2
Experimental Results on KIT Dataset

We further evaluate our method baselines on KIT dataset. As shown in Table 5 , our method still outperforms
other baselines across all metrics, demonstrating the generalization capability.

Additional Visual Results

We present visualization examples of our corrective instructions and reconstructed motion sequences in Fig. 5.
We observe that although the corrective instructions predicted by our algorithm sometimes differ from the
ground truth (e.g., "forehand table tennis" versus "throwing a frisbee"), they can still result in remarkably similar
modified motions. In specific frames, the resulting motions are nearly identical, as seen in the beginning and
ending frames of the first example. This phenomenon aligns with real-world scenarios where individuals can
provide multiple, semantically distinct suggestions that lead to similar corrective outcomes when correcting
others’ mistakes. This underscores the robustness of our approach in generating effective motion corrections,
even when the specific instructions vary.

Considering the diversity of correction instructions, traditional metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, or METEOR
alone may not be sufficient to describe their correctness. Thus, we incorporated CLIP score and reconstruction
metrics as supplementary evaluation measures, creating a more exhaustive benchmark for evaluating correction
instruction generation. We present more visual results in Fig. 7 and 8.

Implementation Details

C.1
Motion Editing

We utilize the pre-trained MDM [40] for motion editing. The model is trained on the HumanML3D dataset
with a batch size 32, a learning rate 0.0002, and training for 50000 epochs. In the editing process, we set the
maximum reverse diffusion steps to 50.

C.2
Architecture of Our Tokenizer

We utilize TCN-based structures for both encoder and decoders, which extract spatiotemporal features for
human motion through convolution with a kernel size of 1. We also extract temporal features through dilation
convolution and larger kernels (9 or 3). We list the details of our network architecture in Tab. 7. The decoders U
and B share the same architecture.

E
Real-world Application

Obtaining precise motion in real life is difficult. However, we find that existing motion estimation algorithms
enable us to obtain usable motion sequences in most cases. To verify whether the current pipeline can be applied
to real life, we conduct the following experiment.

We invited two participants, one acting as a coach and the other as a trainee. The trainee first performed a source
motion sequence. Then, the coach was tasked with generating a target motion sequence that differed from the
source sequence. We utilized a pose estimation algorithm (WHAM[38]) to extract these motion sequences and
use our method to generate corrective instructions. The trainee is then required to correct his motion based on
the corrective instructions. We present an example in Figure 6 of the global response pdf. In this example, it is
evident that existing motion estimation algorithms can accurately estimate the motions of both the trainee and the
coach. Furthermore, our algorithm is capable of understanding these motion sequences to provide appropriate
corrective instructions.

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide
closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems
of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that
preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize
honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete
(and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results, our paper is mainly for application.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

20


---Page Break---
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in
the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide
intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper
(regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We fully disclose the information needed to reproduce our experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the
reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data
are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make
their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice,
or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either
make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to
the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but
reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results,
access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model
checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions
to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be
a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g.,
with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We will release the codes and our generated dataset after acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless
this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/
guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

21


---Page Break---
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have specified the training and test details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate informa-
tion about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We don’t report any error bars in the paper, because we run the experiments with enough
scale of data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims
of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report
a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is
not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were
calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide information for the computer resources in the experiment section.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.

22


---Page Break---
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental
runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into
the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code
of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due
to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts
of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the potential societal impacts in the conclusion.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular
applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications,
the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in
the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the
other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks
could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies
(e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitor-
ing misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the
efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of
data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or
scraped datasets)?

Answer: [No]

Justification: This paper doesn’t include safeguards as we utilize the LLM which already have the
safeguards.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to
usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.

23


---Page Break---
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper,
properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We properly cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset and respect
to their license.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for
some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided
alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We release new assets after acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an
anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include
the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about
compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We don’t utilize crowdsourcing experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the
paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main
paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other
labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

24


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an
equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state
this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for
their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
