Figure 1: Method overview. We propose a framework for training large Vision-Language Models (VLM) with
Reinforcement Learning (RL). At each time step, the VLM takes the current observation and a predesigned
prompt as input and outputs an utterance containing a chain of thought reasoning and a text action. The text
action is parsed into the environment for generating task rewards. Finally, we apply RL with the task reward to
fine-tune the entire VLM.

Abstract

Large vision-language models (VLMs) fine-tuned on specialized visual instruction-
following data have exhibited impressive language reasoning capabilities across
various scenarios. However, this fine-tuning paradigm may not be able to effi-
ciently learn optimal decision-making agents in multi-step goal-directed tasks from
interactive environments. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic
framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically,
our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to gener-
ate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore
intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the
open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the envi-
ronment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these
task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate
that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM

agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models
such as GPT4-V or Gemini. Furthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial
component for performance improvement, as removing the CoT reasoning results
in a significant decrease in the overall performance of our method.

Introduction

Large vision-language models (VLMs) [7, 44, 18] demonstrate remarkable capabilities as general-
purpose agents in solving various tasks through language reasoning. In particular, fine-tuning VLMs
with specialized visual instruction following data appears to be a key technique for improving the
capabilities of VLMs [34, 84, 33, 30]. However, visual instruction tuning may not be optimal for
training decision-making agents in multi-step interactive environments requiring visual recognition
and language understanding, as visual instruction tuning mainly performs supervised learning on pre-
collected datasets without interacting with the environments [22]. Consequently, if the pre-collected
datasets lack sufficient diversity to cover a wide range of decision-making scenarios, visual instruction
tuning may fail to improve the VLM agent’s decision-making capabilities.

To unleash the learning capabilities of VLM agents in multi-step goal-directed decision-making
environments, reinforcement learning (RL), a method that has proven effective in training multi-step
interactive agents [41, 59, 6, 69], naturally offers a paradigm that supports this purpose. However,
while RL has been widely adopted for training purely text-based tasks for large language models
(LLMs) [60, 50, 1, 83], end-to-end VLM fine-tuning with RL for goal-directed multi-step tasks has
not yet been studied, to the best of our knowledge.

Our main contribution in this paper is an algorithmic framework that directly fine-tunes VLMs
with RL for multi-step goal-directed decision-making tasks requiring vision-language understanding.
In our framework, the VLM first receives a task description prompt, which guides it to generate
task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning [75, 73] (blue parts in Figure 1), followed by a
text-based action (red parts in Figure 1). The CoT reasoning is designed for efficient explorations
by prompting the VLMs to generate intermediate reasoning that leads to the final text-based action.
Our framework then parses the text-based actions into executable actions for the environment, which
generates potentially goal-directed rewards and the next state for RL training.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing a VLM’s decision-making capabilities, we
adopt a 7b model [35] as the backbone VLM and apply our method to five decision-making tasks.
These tasks come from two domains: an original domain, which evaluates the VLM’s decision-making
capabilities requiring fine-grained visual recognition and language reasoning, and an embodied AI
domain [58] focusing on testing tasks demanding visual semantic reasoning capabilities. Empirical
results show that our method enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLMs in both domains,
enabling 7b models to surpass the performance of commercial models such as GPT4-V [44] and
Gemini [18]. Moreover, our experiments reveal that CoT reasoning is crucial for performance
improvement in our RL training. Specifically, we test our method on the same tasks without the CoT
reasoning and observe a significant drop in overall performance in both domains.

Related Work

Training LLMs or VLMs with RL.
RL has been widely adopted for training LLMs and VLMs
[85, 61, 70, 45, 10, 50, 9, 43, 18, 62, 60, 1, 20, 83]. Some studies [85, 61, 45, 10, 43, 18, 62] focus
on applying RL from human feedback (RLHF), which involves learning reward models from human
feedback before deploying RL. Other research [50, 9, 60, 1, 20, 83] focuses on deploying RL with
task-specific reward functions without using human preference data. Our paper is similar to the
latter [50, 9, 60, 1, 20, 83] which applies RL to train LLMs on customized reward functions from
different environments. There are two major differences between our paper and prior works [50, 60, 1,
20, 83]. Firstly, our method incorporates visual inputs, broadening its applicability to a wider range of
tasks that require vision-language understanding or multimodal reasoning [29, 38]. Secondly, while
previous works do not explore how CoT reasoning affects RL training on large models in general, we
identify CoT reasoning as a crucial component for enhancing RL training. We empirically observe
that incorporating CoT reasoning significantly improves the overall performance of RL training on
all tested domains.

Adopting LLMs and VLMs as decision-making agents.
Many prior works have studied various
methods of using frozen LLMs and VLMs for decision-making. One line of work studies the
prompting techniques [75, 14, 79, 78, 74, 31, 76, 47, 71, 48, 24] for enhancing the decision-making
capabilities of large foundation models, see Dong et al. [14], Yang et al. [77] for a detailed survey for
other prompting based methods. Our work differs from all prompting-based methods since we directly
use RL to fine-tune the entire VLM as decision-making agents. Other studies [42, 64, 4, 52, 11]
integrate frozen VLMs ot LLMs into their training pipeline for processing task descriptions or
feature extraction, without using text-based actions. focuses on integrating different components
from VLMs for downstream RL training. For example, some studies use the VLMs or CLIP vision
encoder [46, 42, 64] as reward models for training, which differs from our method since we adopt
rewards from the environments. Other studies [42, 64, 11] integrate frozen VLMs/LLMs into their
training pipeline for processing task descriptions [42, 64, 46] or feature extraction [11], without using
text-based actions. Our paper differs from these works [42, 64, 11] in two major aspects. From a
technical perspective, we focus on a more challenging paradigm by directly fine-tuning the entire
VLM with RL, whereas previous methods [42, 64, 11] only train additional MLP or transformer
layers to connect the frozen LLM/VLM with the action space. More importantly, our method directly
interacts with the environments using open-ended text, enabling it to utilize the CoT reasoning
capability of VLMs for more efficient explorations for decision-making.

Evaluating VLMs as decision-making agents.
Previous studies have thoroughly examined the
fundamental evaluations of VLMs in non-interactive tasks [3, 37, 80, 32, 65, 81, 16]. Our focus,
however, is on evaluating a VLM’s decision-making capabilities in interactive environments that
require both visual recognition and language reasoning. Representative interactive environments
include purely text-based environments [13, 28, 72] or embodied AI environments [40, 58, 56, 15].
We adopt the ALFWorld [58] embodied environment for evaluating our method’s ability to improve
VLM’s visual semantic reasoning capabilities. In addition to the ALFWorld embodied AI environment,
we also design an original “gym-like” [8] environment to test VLM’s decision-making capabilities in
tasks that require fine-grained visual recognition and language reasoning.

CoT prompting.
Recent studies in prompting for LLMs have demonstrated the crucial role of CoT
in enhancing complex reasoning capabilities [75, 26, 17, 73, 82, 79]. Wei et al. [75] show that CoT
reasoning can significantly boost LLMs’ performance across different reasoning tasks by showing
that adding simple exemplar-based prompts, leading to better performance on benchmarks such as
the GSM8K [12]. A follow-up study [73] proposes a novel self-consistency decoding strategy that
explores multiple reasoning paths, demonstrating substantial gains in arithmetic and commonsense
reasoning tasks. Other works [26, 82, 17] have shown that adding prompts to break complex tasks
into subtasks and solve them step-by-step significantly improves LLM’s reasoning capability. Our
work differs from these CoT prompting studies as we aim to provide an algorithmic framework that
can train VLMs with RL, where the CoT prompting appears as a key component of the framework.
In contrast, prior works focus on improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with increasingly
sophisticated prompting of frozen models.

Preliminaries

Standard RL terminologies.
We follow the standard notations from classic RL literature [63, 2].
Specifically, we use M = {S, A, P, r, γ} to denote an MDP, where S denotes the state space, A
denotes the action space, P denotes the transition dynamics, r : S × A →R denotes the reward
function and γ ∈[0, 1] denotes the discount factor. Our goal is to learn a policy π : S →A that

maximizes the overall discounted return maxπ∈Π Eπ
hPT
t=0 γtr(st, at)
i
, where T is the maximum

number of steps per episode. Without loss of generality, we use π(a|s) ∈[0, 1] to denote probability
of π choosing a at s.

Adapting the RL formalism to VLMs.
We use V to denote the discrete and finite vocabulary
(token) space, and we use Vm, Vn to represent the input and output text space, where m and n
represent the maximum token length of the input and output sequence. We adapt the RL formalism
to VLMs by treating the combination of the vision and language inputs to VLMs as the state space:
S = O × Vm, where O is the space of all RGB images. We view each utterance [1, 83] of the

3


---Page Break---
language outputs from VLMs as the action space Vn. Therefore, the input and output of a VLM
policy with parameter θ can be written as πθ : O × Vm →Vn. For example, in the Blackjack task
shown in Figure 1, each state s consists of an RGB image o with the cards of the dealer and the player,
as well as an input prompt vin with maximum token length m, and the text output vout = πθ(o, vin)
(with a maximum token n) will later be parsed as an action to interact with the environment. Similar
to the standard RL setting, we use πθ(vout|o, vin) ∈[0, 1] to denote the probability of a VLM policy
πθ outputting vout with input image o and prompt vin.

Training VLMs with RL

Compared to classic MLP-based policy networks [53–55, 19], a natural advantage of VLM policies is
that they can leverage CoT reasoning for efficient exploration, by performing intermediate reasoning
steps that lead to the final decision. However, training a VLM policy πθ with RL presents additional
challenges. First, the VLM policy πθ(o, vin) directly generates open-ended text rather than vectorized
actions in classic policy gradient-based RL methods [53–55, 19], complicating direct interaction with
the environment. Even with a parsing mechanism f : Vn →A that maps open-ended text vout to
a legal action a for interaction with the environment, it remains unclear how to estimate the action
probability πθ(a|o, vin) from the text generation process.

Figure 2 presents an overview of our framework, leveraging the CoT reasoning and addressing the two
aforementioned challenges. We design a task-specific prompt vin that requires the VLM to generate a
formatted output vout, including the CoT reasoning. Next, we adopt a post-processing function f
to parse open-ended text into a legal action at that can directly interact with the environment. To
compute πθ(a|o, vin), we develop a method to estimate its value based on the probability of each
output token in vout.

t and a visual observation ot. The VLM takes st = [ot, vin
t ] as input and outputs open-ended text
vout

containing the CoT reasoning, keywords "action" : "at", and the log-likelihood of vout
t . We first apply a
post-processing function f on vout
t , to obtain a legal action at which can interact with the environment. Then,
we input at to the environment for obtaining reward r(st, at) and the next observation ot+1. Afterward, we
devise a method to compute a numerical value of πθ(at|ot, vin
t ). Finally, we use r(st, at) and πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) for
the RL training.

The remaining Section is structured as follows. First, we describe the format of our input prompt vin
t
and the desired output vout
t
(Section 4.1). Next, we present the post-processing function f (Section 4.2).
Then, we introduce a method to compute a numerical value of πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) (Section 4.3). Finally,
we conclude our framework in Algorithm 1 (Section 4.4).

4.1
Prompt Design for Domain-Specific Outputs

For each task M, our input prompt vin
t contains a description of the task, the legal action space of the
current observation, and the desired output format (including the CoT reasoning). Our desired output
vout
t , contains a CoT reasoning followed by the keywords "action" : "at" for post-processing.
Figure 3 provides an example of our input prompt vin
t and the desired formatted output vout
t . In
particular, we define a function h which constructs vin
t from the current observation ot: vin
t = h(ot), to
accommodate for tasks that may contain observation-dependent information.3 We provide additional
examples of vin and vout in Appendix B.

3E.g., the alfworld environment (to be introduced in Section 5.2) contains an observation-dependent
admissible action space.

the red part is the text-based action. Note that the CoT reasoning may contain other task-specific descriptions,
see Appendix B for more details.

4.2
Post-Processing Open-Ended Text for Legal Actions

Our post-processing mechanism involves both vin
t and f. In the input prompt vin
t , we directly ask the
VLM to output a text-based action in the format of "action" : "at" (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 for
examples). After obtaining vout
t , our post-processing function f directly searches for the text-based
keywords "action" : "at" from vout
t , and maps it to a legal action at, either in symbolic or in text
depending on the task of interest. For the case shown in Figure 1, f will map vout
t
to the symbolic
operator that represents the action "stand" in the Blackjack task (to be introduced in Section 5.1),
as the Blackjack task takes symbolic actions as input. For the alfworld [58] environment shown
in Figure 2, f will map vout
t
to the text "look", because the alfworld environment takes text-based
actions as inputs.

However, VLMs are not always guaranteed to generate a vout
t
that contains the keywords "action" :
"at", even when we explicitly request a formatted output from vin
t . To continue the RL training when
vout
t
does not contain any legal action, we perform random exploration by selecting a legal action
at ∈A uniformly at random. Mathematically, f is defined as follows:

f(vout) =
a,
if "action" : "a" ∈vout,
Unif(A),
otherwise.

4.3
Estimating Action Probabilities of VLM Policies

To estimate the action probability log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) (or equivalently log πθ(at|ot, vin
t )) for pol-
icy gradient-based methods [55], a naïve calculation is directly using log πθ(vout
t |ot, vin
t ) as
log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ), by summing the log-likelihood of all tokens in vout
t . This is because

log πθ(vout
t |ot, vin
t ) = log P(ot, vin
t , vout
t )
P(ot, vin
t )

= log

(4.2)

In the equation above, we use v to denote the output token vout
t
for simplicity, and we use v[:i]
to denote the first i tokens in vout
t , and we slightly abuse our notion by using P(ot, vin
t , v[:0]) to
denote P(ot, vin
t ) in the log summation. Hence, a natural way to compute a numerical value for

log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) is Pn

may not be

ideal for computing πθ(at|ot, vin

also contains CoT reason-
ing. This is because in vout

longer than the action tokens vact
t
(see the blue and red parts in Figure 3 for examples, and
see Table 1 for a relative scaling of their sum log-likelihood).
Hence the naïve computa-
tion log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) ←log πθ(vtht
t |ot, vin
t ) + log πθ(vact
t |ot, vin
t , vtht
t ) will make log πθ(at|ot, vin

largely determined by the CoT tokens log πθ(vtht
t |ot, vin

our post-processing function f only relies on vact

for decision-making.

a much larger magnitude than log P(vact

across all tasks we have tested (in terms of absolute

Hence, to mitigate the effect of the CoT to-
kens, we adopt a scaling factor λ ∈[0, 1] to scale down
log πθ(vtht
t |ot, vin
t ) for obtaining a regularized version of
log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ), which results in

log πθ(at|ot, vin

←λ log πθ(vtht

(4.3)

Empirically, we observe the scaling factor λ could largely affect the final performance. As we will
show in Section 6.2, choosing an extreme λ value (close to 1 or 0) will degrade overall performance.
All of our experiments adopt λ ∈[0.2, 0.5].

Putting the prompt construction function h (Section 4.1), the post-processing function f (Section 4.2),

Evaluation Tasks

How does our method improve a VLM’s decision-making capabilities in tasks that require fine-
grained vision-language reasoning or semantic understanding? To study this question, we adopt two
different domains: gym_cards and alfworld [58]. Our original gym_cards domain is a “gym-like”
environment [8] containing four tasks designed to test the decision-making capabilities of VLMs.

6


---Page Break---
These tasks require fine-grained visual-language reasoning, specifically focusing on recognizing
numbers for arithmetic reasoning. In addition, we also adopt alfworld [58], which assesses the
decision-making capabilities of VLMs in an embodied AI setting that demands visual semantic
understanding. We present some examples of the visual observations of each task in Figure 4. We do
not include standard image-based Atari benchmarks [5, 39] due to limited computation resources.4

Figure 4: Examples of observation of our evaluation tasks. (a)-(d) are from our original gym_cards domain.
(a)-(c) are deterministic tasks with increasing difficulties; (d) is a stochastic task.

5.1
Gym Cards

Our gym_cards domain is designed to evaluate a VLM’s decision-making capabilities requiring
fine-grained vision recognition and language reasoning. More precisely, tasks in the gym_cards
domain require the VLM to recognize the numbers (potentially from cards) and utilize the numbers
for language reasoning. As depicted in Figure 4, the first three tasks—NumberLine, EZPoints, and
Points24—are deterministic, and developed to assess the VLMs’ ability to identify and process num-
bers or mathematical operators at each time step. These tasks increase in complexity: NumberLine
requires recognition of two numbers in an image, EZPoints involves identifying numbers from two
cards, and Points24 extends to recognizing four cards. The Blackjack task challenges the VLM
further by requiring the agent to reason based on visual information and adapt to stochastic outcomes.
This subsection outlines the goals of each task, and we leave the detailed descriptions of their state
spaces, action spaces, and reward functions to Appendix B.1.

NumberLine.
In this task, the goal is to move a number to the target on a synthetic number
line. At each state st, the visual observation ot contains two lines of text: “Target: x” and “Current:
yt”. The agent needs to move the current number yt to the target number x, by outputting text vout
t
that interacts with the discrete action space {"+", "−"}. Mapping the vout
t
to "+" or "−" will
increase or decrease the current number by 1, respectively.

EZPoints.
In this task, the goal is to output a formula using the numbers in the cards that
evaluates to 12. At each state st, the agent observes an image of two cards and a text version of
(potentially incomplete) “formula” below the cards. The goal is to use all numbers in the cards (only
once) to compute 12. The action space contains natural numbers in [1, 10], as well as operator in
{"+", "∗", "="}. At each state st, only operators and numbers that appear in the cards are legal
actions, and “J”, “Q”, or “K” are treated as “10”. In particular, if the output text vout
t
is mapped to
a legal action at at state st, the text version of at will be appended to the “formula” in the current
image of st resulting st+1, otherwise st+1 will remain the same as st.

Points24.
In this task, the goal is to output a formula using the numbers in the cards that
evaluates to 24. The Points24 task is a harder version of EZPoints as it contains 4 cards, hence
requiring the VLMs to generate a longer formula. The rules of Points24 are similar to EZPoints,
despite two minor differences: the Points24 task requires the VLM to compute a target number of
24, and its action space contains more operators: {"+", "−", "∗", "/", "="}.

Blackjack.
In this task, the goal is to win the current blackjack game. At each state st, the visual
observation ot consists of two cards (one face-down) from the dealer and all cards from the player.

4Image-based Atari tasks generally take at least 2 million environment steps to reach a reasonable perfor-
mance [23]. Our method needs roughly 30 hours to run 15k environment steps due to the model size of the
backbone VLMs, which requires roughly half a year to run 2 million environment steps.

---Page Break---
The agent’s goal in this task is to win the current game, by outputting text vout
t
that can be mapped to
{"stand", "hit"}. The agent will receive one more card if vout
t
is mapped to "hit", and the game
will terminate if vout
t
is mapped to "stand".

5.2
ALFWorld

While the gym_cards domain is designed to assess the VLM’s arithmetic reasoning requiring fine-
grained visual recognition, the alfworld environment aims at testing VLM’s decision-making tasks
requiring visual semantic understanding.

ALFWorld.
The ALFWorld embodied environment [58] is combines a text-based interactive
environment [13] with a large vision-language instruction following dataset [57]. It contains 6
different types of goal-conditioned tasks (“Pick & Place”, “Examine in Light”, “Clean & Place”,
“Heat & Place”, “Cool & Place”, and “Pick Two & Place”), and the agent’s goal is to navigate in the
environment via text-based actions (e.g., "go to shelf 1", "examine sidetable 1"). Unlike
our original gym_cards environment, where all states share the same action space, the alfworld
environment contains a state-dependent admissible action space – some actions are only available at
certain states. For example, if the agent’s goal is to “put some pillows on armchair”, then the agent
can only put a pillow after picking up a pillow. Hence, to incorporate the state-dependent admissible
action set, our prompt of alfworld asks the VLM to choose among an admissible action. See
Figure 2 for an example of the visual observation of alfworld. We leave the detailed descriptions of
the alfworld (state space, action space, reward functions, and the CoT prompt) to Appendix B.2.

Experimental Results

The first part of our experiment examines how our method improves the decision-making capabilities
of VLMs (Section 6.1). The second part investigates the role of CoT reasoning in our method
(Section 6.2). Details of our experimental setup are provided in Appendix C.

6.1
Improving VLM Decision-Making Capabilities

Does our method improve the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various domains?
To investigate this, we assess how our method improves arithmetic tasks requiring fine-grained visual
recognition in the gym_cards domain and visual semantic reasoning in the alfworld domain. The
gym_cards experiments include deterministic tasks (NumberLine, EZPoints, and Points24, each
with increasing difficulty) and a stochastic task (Blackjack). In the alfworld domain, we evaluate
overall performance and detailed task-specific performance as discussed in Section 5.2. We instantiate
our method on top of the llava-v1.6-mistral-7b [35] model and compare it against commercial models
(GPT4-V and Gemini), a supervised fine-tuned version of the llava-v1.6-mistral-7b model (LLaVA-
sft),5 and a vanilla RL implementation using a CNN-based policy network (CNN+RL).6 The final
results and learning curves are presented in Table 2 and Figure 5. Details of the experimental setup
are provided in Appendix C.

Enhancing decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks.
As illustrated
in Table 2 and Figure 5, our method demonstrates consistent improvement across various tasks,
including deterministic (NumberLine and EZPoints)7 or stochastic (Blackjack) arithmetic tasks
and visual semantic reasoning task (alfworld). Specifically, our method improves the average
performance from the initial LLaVA-sft model by 27.1% on arithmetic tasks (18.4% →45.5%) and

5To ensure the RL training starts from a model with reasonable instruction following capabilities [45], our
RL training for VLM starts from the LLaVA-sft checkpoint of each task, we leave the detailed training pipeline
of our method to Appendix C.1.
6The CNN-based method adopts the same CLIP vision encoder as LLaVA-7b. Additionally, for tasks that
require text inputs (e.g., alfworld), we adopt the RoBERTa-base [36] model to encode the text feature and
concatenate the text and CLIP visual features for downstream RL training. Details of our CNN-based model are
provided to Appendix C.2.
7Although Points24 shares similar rules with EZPoints, it requires the VLM to recognize all four cards
and generate much longer equations. Most failure cases in Points24 are caused by either inaccurate visual
perception or flawed language reasoning. We provide some examples of these failures in Appendix C.5.

RL-based methods (CNN+RL and our method), we present the peak numbers (first 15k environment steps for the
gym_cards and 5k environment steps for alfworld) from each training curve from Figure 5. We average the
performance of all 4 tasks on gym_cards with equal weight. Due to the nature of the alfworld environment,
where each subtask does not appear with equal probability, the average performance on alfworld is a weighted
average among all types of tasks. We mark the BUTLERg and BUTLER agent [58] in gray since they require
expert data, while the remaining methods do not require expert data. As discussed by Shridhar et al. [58], the
performance discrepancy between BUTLERg and BUTLER happens due to different decoding strategies in
evaluation strategies: BUTLERg uses greedy decoding, which may repeat failed actions, whereas BUTLER
employs beam search during evaluation.

achieves the best performance among all comparative methods, surpassing the second-best method
by 14.0% (CNN+RL) on gym_cards and 2.3% (GPT4-V) on alfworld.

6.2
Understanding the Role of the CoT Reasoning

In Section 6.1, we have demonstrated that our method improves the arithmetic and visual semantic
reasoning capabilities of VLM agents. Conceptually, our method can be viewed as an augmented
version of the standard CNN-based RL, where the text output [vtht, vact] (from Figure 3) serve as the
text action vact, augmented by CoT reasoning vtht. This raises an important question: How does the
CoT reasoning vtht influence the overall performance of our method? To assess the impact of CoT
reasoning on our method’s performance, we conduct two sets of ablation experiments. The first set
(presented in Table 3 and Figure 6) evaluates our method without the CoT reasoning, and the second
part (shown in Figure 7) examines various scaling hyperparameters λ for the log-likelihood of CoT
tokens, as defined in Equation 4.3.

The crucial role of CoT reasoning in performance improvement.
As presented in Table 3 and
Figure 6, the performance of our method significantly decreases without the CoT reasoning.8 Besides
the improvement in the final performance, CoT reasoning appears to be a crucial component for
deterministic arithmetic tasks (NumberLine and EZPoints), as our method fails to improve these
two tasks without the CoT reasoning.

The importance of moderate scaling factors λ.
As dis-
cussed in Section 4.3, integrating CoT reasoning into our frame-
work involves tuning an additional hyperparameter, λ ∈[0, 1]
(proposed in Equation 4.3). To identify an optimal range for
λ, we conduct experiments assessing the impact of various λ.
Our results in Figure 7 indicate that a moderate λ (between
0.3 and 0.5) enables effective training on the NumberLine task.
Conversely, our method fails when λ is set too large (≥0.7)
or too small (≤0.1), and we empirically find that an optimal
λ typically falls within 0.2 to 0.5. This is because a large λ
results in an estimate of log πθ(at|ot, vin
t ) being overly influ-
enced by log πθ(vtht
t |ot, vin
t ), while a small λ value causes πθ to
be predominantly affected by log πθ(vact
t |ot, vin
t , vtht
t ), thereby
reducing the effect of the CoT reasoning in RL training.

7
Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Directions

In this paper, we introduce an algorithmic framework that directly fine-tunes VLMs using RL, with
the help of the VLM’s CoT reasoning capability. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can
enhance the decision-making abilities of VLMs across diverse domains that require fine-grained visual
recognition or visual semantic understanding. In addition, we demonstrate that CoT reasoning is a
crucial component for enabling RL training, allowing 7b VLMs to outperform established commercial
models such as GPT-4V and Gemini on most tasks. While our results suggest that CoT reasoning is
crucial to the performance improvement of VLM training with RL, we have not extensively explored
the effects of different prompting techniques in this work, which will be an interesting future direction.
The performance gain of our method is also limited by the size of the action space and the difficulties
of the task. For example alfworld does not enjoy as much performance gain as gym_cards, since
alfworld is a multi-task environment and it has a much larger action space than gym_cards.

Additional Details of the Evaluation Tasks

B.1
Gym Cards

B.1.1
NumberLine

State and action space.
In the NumberLine task, the visual observation at each state st contains two
lines of text: “Target: x” and “Current: yt”, where x, yt are both integers such that x, yt ∈[0, nmax ],
where nmax is an environment input variable that controls the maximum position of the numbers.
The goal is to move the current number yt to the target number x, by sequentially choosing actions
from the discrete action space {"+", "−"}. We set nmax = 5 for all experiments in this work, but
nmax can be set to any positive integers. Choosing "+" or "−" will increase or decrease the current
number yt by 1, respectively, and the agent will stay at the boundary if it takes an action that attempts
to cross the boundary (e.g., taking at = "+" when yt = nmax or at = "−" when xt = 0). See an
example of the state action transition in Figure 8.

−→
"action": "+"
−→

Figure 8: An example of the transition in NumberLine.

Reward functions and the CoT prompts.
An episode in NumberLine ends when the current
number equals the target number or the maximum step T = 2nmax is reached. The agent receives
a terminal reward of r(st, at) = 1 when yt+1 = x. The agent also receives a reward penalty of
r(st, at) = −1 upon taking an incorrect action that does not result in a closer position to the target
(|x −yt| ≥|x −yt+1|), otherwise the agent receives reward r(st, at) = 0. In the example provided
above (Figure 8), the agent receives a reward r = 0, since it moves closer to the target, but not
reaching the target yet. For the NumberLine task, we adopt the following CoT prompt in Figure 9,
and for the case without CoT reasoning (discussed in Section 6.2), we use the same prompt but
without the blue CoT reasoning parts.

CoT prompt vin
t for task NumberLine
You are playing a game called number line. You will see a target number and a current number in the
image. And your goal is to move the current number closer to the target by choosing either adding
or subtracting one to the current number. Your response should be a valid json file in the following
format:
{

"current number": "x",
"target number": "x",
"thoughts": {first read out the current and target number, then think carefully about which action to
choose},
"action": "-" or "+"
}

Figure 9: Task-specific CoT prompt input vin
t for NumberLine. The blue part represents the CoT reasoning
and the red part is the text-based action.

B.1.2
EZPoints

State and action space.
In the EZPoints task, the agent will observe an image of two cards and
a text version of “formula” below the cards, at each state st. The goal is to use the cards in the
image to compute a target number of 12 and we view {"J", "Q", "K"} as "10". The action space of
EZPoints is {"1", "2", .. ., "10", "+", "∗", "="} and each number in the cards can only be used
once. Any action attempting to either select a number not shown in the cards or use a card more than
once are illegal. At st, if a legal action at is taken, the action will be appended to the text “formula”
in st and becomes the next state st+1. On the other hand, when an illegal action is taken, st+1 will
remain the same as st. All images generated from the EZPoints environment are guaranteed to have
a viable solution for computing 12.

−→
"action": "+"
−→

Figure 10: An example of the transition in EZPoints.

Reward functions and the CoT prompts.
An episode terminates when "=" is taken or the
maximum step T = 5 is reached. The agent receives a reward of r = −1 upon taking an illegal
action, and r = 0 while taking a legal action. When "=" is taken, the agent will receive a positive
reward r = 10 if the formula equals 12, and r = −1 otherwise. For the EZPoints task, we adopt the
following CoT prompt in Figure 11, and for the case without CoT reasoning (discussed in Section 6.2),
we use the same prompt but without the blue CoT reasoning parts and the brown part in Figure 11 is
the text version of the current formula directly extracted from the current state st.

CoT prompt vin
t for EZPoints
You are an expert card game player. You are observing two cards in the image. You are observing the
current formula: '5'. You can choose between ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10',
'+', '*', '=']. The number or operator you choose will be appended to the current formula. Note
that 'J', 'Q', and 'K' count as '10'. Your goal is to output a formula that evaluates to 12, and each
number can only be used once. Your response should be a valid json file in the following format:
{

"cards": [x, y],
"current formula": '5',
"thoughts": {First check whether the current formula 'z' is complete. If the current formula 'z'
is complete, output '='. Otherwise consider which number or operator should be appended to the
current formula to make it equal 12.}
"action": "{number}" or "{operator}"

B.1.3
Points24

State and action space.
Similar to EZPoints, the goal of Points24 is also to generate a formula
to compute the target number of 24, using all four cards. Points24 has a slightly larger action space:
{"1", "2", . . . , "10", "+", "−", "∗", "/", "(", ")", "="} and two more cards. Each number in the
cards can only be used once. Similar to EZPoints, any action attempting to either select a number
not shown in the cards or use a card more than once are illegal. At st, if a legal action at is taken,
the action will be appended to the text “formula” in st and becomes the next state st+1. When an
illegal action is taken, st+1 will remain the same as st. Different from EZPoints where all images
are guaranteed to have a viable solution for computing 12, the images generated by Points24 do not
always have a viable solution to 24.

−→
"action": "+"
−→

Figure 12: An example of the transition in Points24.

Reward functions and the CoT prompts.
The reward functions and termination conditions of
Points24 are the same as those in EZPoints. An episode terminates when "=" is taken or the
maximum step T = 20 is reached. The agent receives a reward of r = −1 upon taking an illegal
action, and r = 0 while taking legal actions. When "=" is taken, the agent will receive a positive
reward r = 10 when the formula equals 24, and r = −1 otherwise. For the Points24 task, we
adopt the following CoT prompt in Figure 13, and for the case without CoT reasoning (discussed
in Section 6.2), we use the same prompt but without the blue CoT reasoning parts and the brown
part in Figure 13 is the text version of the current formula directly extracted from the current state st.
We also provide an additional feature that allows us to view {"J", "Q", "K"} as {"11", "12",
"13"}, instead of {"10"}.

appended to the current formula. Note that 'J', 'Q', and 'K' count as '10'. Your goal is to output
a formula that evaluates to 24, and each number can only be used once. Your response should be a
valid json file in the following format:
{

"cards": [x, y, z, w],
"current formula": '(2'

B.1.4
Blackjack

State and action space.
For the Blackjack task, the visual observation at state st consists of two
cards (one face-down) from the dealer and all cards from the player. The agent’s goal in this task is to
win the current game, by choosing actions in {"stand", "hit"}. The agent will receive a new card
upon choosing "hit". See Figure 14 for an example transition.

−→
"action": "hit"
−→

Figure 14: An example of the transition in Blackjack.

Reward functions and the CoT prompts.
The game terminates when the player chooses "stand"
or busts (total points exceed 21). We adopt the same reward function as the Blackjack-v1 task in
Gymnasiym [68], where r(st, at) = 1, 0, −1 upon win, draw, and loss, respectively. We also provide
a similar feature as Gymnasium [68], where the “blackjack” winning (the agent win with an "A"
and a "10", "J", "Q" or "K") reward r of the player will become 1.5. In the example provided in
Figure 14, the game has not terminated after taking the action "hit", hence the agent will not receive
any rewards, even though it has total points of 21. For the Blackjack task, we adopt the following
CoT prompt in Figure 15, and for the case without CoT reasoning (discussed in Section 6.2), we use
the same prompt but without the blue CoT reasoning parts.

CoT prompt vin
t for Blackjack
You are a blackjack player. You are observing the current game state, you can choose between
['stand', 'hit']. Your response should be a valid json file in the following format:
{

"thoughts": "{first describe your total points and the dealer’s total points then think about which
action to choose}",
"action": "stand" or "hit"
}

B.2
ALFWorld

State and action space.
Inherited from Text World [13], at each state st of alfworld, the
agent will observe an RGB image and text-based description. The action space of alfworld
can be summarized these following format [58]: (1) goto {recep}; (2) take {obj} from
{recep}; (3) put {obj} in/on {recep}; (4) open {recep}; (5) close {recep}; (6) toggle
{obj}{recep}; (7) clean {obj} with {recep}; (8) heat {obj} with {recep}; (9) cool
{obj} with {recep}, where {obj} and {recep} stands for objects and receptacles. See Figure 16

for an example of the state action transition in the alfworld environment.

You arrive at loc 0. The cabinet 1 is
open. On the cabinet 1, you see a pan
1, a kettle 1, a winebottle 1, a apple
1, a stoveknob 1, a stoveknob 2, a
stoveknob 3, a stoveknob 4, a knife 1,
a saltshaker 1, and a bread 1.

"action":

You arrive at loc 2. The cabinet 2
is open. On the cabinet 2, you see
a houseplant 1, a pot 1, a bread 1, a
kettle 1, a bowl 1, a soapbottle 1, and
a knife 2.

Figure 16: An example of the transition in alfworld.

Reward functions and the CoT prompts.
Each state s ∈S of alfworld has a set of admissible
actions Aadm(s), a final goal gtask, and subgoals gsub. Since the goal of alfworld is to complete the
language-based goal-conditioned tasks, we reward the agent upon reaching subgoals and completing
the task, while penalizing the agent upon taking inadmissible actions. To summarize, we define the
reward function of alfworld as r(st, at, st+1|gtask) = 50 ∗1 {st+1 = gtask} + 1 {st+1 = gsub} −
1 {at /∈Aadm(st)}. For the alfworld task, we adopt the following CoT prompt in Figure 17, and for
the case without CoT reasoning (discussed in Section 6.2), we use the same prompt but without the
blue CoT reasoning parts and the brown part in Figure 17 is the text description of the task directly
extracted from the current state st.

Additional Details on the Experiments

We provide additional detailed of the experimental results in Section 6 here. Details of our experimen-
tal pipeline is provided in Section C.1, including preparing the initial SFT checkpoints and the RL
training. Section C.2 contains details setup of all comparative methods. We list task-specific training
details in Section C.3. We provide additional experimental results in Section C.4. Section C.5 lists
several failure examples of the Points24 tasks.

C.1
Experimental Pipeline

Our experiments adopt a similar pipeline as RLHF [45], where we first apply supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) to the backbone llava-v1.6-mistral-7b model, before RL training. As outlined by Ouyang et al.
[45], the RLHF training procedure consists of three distinct stages: SFT, learning reward models from
human preference data, and applying RL with the learned reward models. Our pipeline is analogous
to RLHF but without requiring the collection of human preference data for learning reward models,
as we can directly collect rewards from the environment.9 Consequently, our experimental pipeline
only contains two stages: SFT and RL, which we will explain below.

Supervised fine-tuning.
For the original gym_cards environment, we manually construct
instruction-following data for all tasks following the format specified in Figure 3 of Section 4.1.
As for alfworld, we use GPT4-V [44] to collect instruction following data for SFT. For all tasks,
we prepare two versions of the instruction-following data, one with CoT and one without. We
leave the details of the CoT prompts for each task, and the details of each fine-tuning dataset in
Appendix D. After constructing the instruction-following data (with and without CoT), we fine-
tune llava-v1.6-mistral-7b for 1 epoch on the collected data for each task and report the results for
LLaVA-sft.

RL training.
For each task, we start our RL training from the LLaVA-sft checkpoint. The LLaVA
model [34] consists of three jointly trainable components, a CLIP vision encoder [49], an LLM

9We adopt the same pipeline for the evaluation without CoT reasoning (discussed in Section 6.2) while
changing the data for SFT as well as vin (see more details on our SFT data and vin in Appendix D)

backbone [66, 67, 25], and an MLP projector that connects visual features and the word embeddings,
and we directly apply PPO [55] to train all three components. Due to computation resource limitations,
we instantiate our experiments via LoRA [21], with the LoRA configuration of r = 128, α =
256, dropout = 0.05, for all trainable components. For the CoT coefficient λ, we set λ = 0.5 in the
gym_cards domain and λ = 0.2 in alfworld.

C.2
Experimental Setup for Comparative Methods

GPT4-V and Gemini.
All of our experimental results on GPT4-V [44] and Gemini [18] are tested
on March 15, 2024, using the same prompt for our RL training (see detailed prompts in Appendix D).
For gym_cards, the numbers from both GPT4-V and Gemini are averaged among the same number
of episodes: 200 episodes for deterministic tasks (NumberLine, EZPoints and Points24); 1000
episodes for stochastic task (Blackjack). As for alfworld, we report the performance of GPT4-V
on all 1000 episodes we collected, see Appendix D.5 for our data collection on alfworld using
GPT4-V. Due to the financial budget, we report the results of Gemini using 100 episodes.

LLaVA-sft.
For each number of LLaVA-sft, we first collect the instruction-following dataset for
each task and then fine-tune LLaVA-1.6-7b for 1 epoch on the collected data using the official LLaVA
fine-tuning script.10 Details of our data collection process is provided in Appendix D. We also use
the same LLaVA-sft checkpoint as initializations for the downstream RL training.

CNN-based RL.
Since the LLaVA-7b model adopts a CLIP ViT-L/14 vision encoder which is more
powerful than vanilla CNN embeddings, we instantiate our CNN-based method using the feature from
the same CLIP ViT-L/14 for a fair comparison. For tasks (EZPoints, Points24, and alfworld,
see our detailed prompt in Appendix D) that require text inputs, we adopt the RoBERTa-base [36]
model to encode the text feature and concatenate the text and CLIP visual features for downstream
RL training. After obtaining the CLIP (potentially concatenated with text) features, we adopt 2 MLP
layers followed by a fully connected layer to map the clip features into the action space. We adopt
the PPO [55] implementation from Kostrikov [27] as the backbone RL algorithm. In addition, we
adopt a CosineAnnealingLR learning rate scheduler, with the initial learning rate of 3e −4, the
final learning rate of 1e −8, and the maximum learning rate step of 25. The remaining task specific
hyperparameters are the same as the VLM case in Section C.3.

C.3
General Setup for End-to-End RL Training

All experiments are conducted on an 8 A100s DGX machine (80G), while the maximum VRAM
requirement is < 40G. Each curve from Figure 5 and 6 takes at most 36 hours to finish. We adopt
DeepSpeed zero2 [51] for multi-gpu training. During our training for the VLM, we directly train
all trainable components (vision encoder, LLM, and the MLP projector). We adopt an open-source
implementation [27] for the PPO. Inspired by von Werra et al. [70], Castricato et al. [10], we apply a
3-layer MLP as the value head, on top of the output hidden states layer before the output tokens, to
estimate the value function V πθ. After obtaining the value estimate Vϕ, we adopt the generalized
advantage estimator (GAE) [54] to estimate the return function ˆR(s) and the advantage function ˆAπθ
of πθ. In addition, we adopt a CosineAnnealingLR learning rate scheduler, with the initial learning
rate of 1e −5, the final learning rate of 1e −9, and the maximum learning rate step of 25. For
all experiments in the gym_cards and alfworld environment, we set the scaling hyperparameter
λ = 0.5, 0, 2, respectively. The learning rate decay happens after every PPO update, which consists
of 4 epochs of gradient updates with PPO. The number of data for on-policy training and batch size
is task-dependent, we list them below.

Numberline and Blackjack.
For NumberLine and Blackjack, our VLM training curves in
Figure 5 use 4 GPUs. Our implementation naturally enables different random seeds on different
GPUs, hence our VLM curves are averaged among 4 seeds. For one PPO update on each GPU,
we collect 512 transitions, with a batch size of 128 per GPU (batch size = 512 in total). The
episode return and success rate are averaged with NumberLine, Blackjack are averaged among 200
and 1000 episodes, respectively. We averaged the return of Blackjack on more episodes because

10https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/finetune.sh.
We start
from the llava-v1.6-mistral-7b instead of the v1.5 checkpoint in the script.

22


---Page Break---
Blackjack contains stochastic while NumberLine is a deterministic task. We adopt the same number
of transitions and batch size for the on-policy training in the CNN-based method on both tasks. The
CNN-based methods are averaged among 4 random seeds as well.

EZPoints and Points24.
For EZPoints and Points24, our VLM training curves in Figure 5 use
4 GPUs. Our implementation naturally enables different random seeds on different GPUs, hence
our VLM curves are averaged among 4 seeds. For one PPO update on each GPU, we collect 1024
transitions, with a batch size of 128 per GPU (batch size = 512 in total). We use 1024 transitions
because the episodes of EZPoints and Points24 usually have longer horizons than NumberLine
and Blackjack. The episode return and success rate are averaged with EZPoints and Points24
are averaged among 200. We adopt the same number of transitions and batch size for the on-policy
training in the CNN-based method on both tasks. The CNN-based methods are averaged among 4
random seeds as well.

ALFWorld.
For the alfworld environment, each run of our VLM training curves in Figure 5
and Figure 19 are conducted on one GPU, and each curve is averaged among 4 seeds. We do not
conduct multi-GPU training for alfworld because the on-policy sampling time has a huge variance
on different GPUs, which will largely increase the synchronization time across different GPUs. For
each PPO update, we collect 1024 transitions, and with a batch size of 256. The episode success rates
are averaged among 200 episodes. We adopt the same number of transitions and batch size for the
on-policy training in the CNN-based method on both tasks. The CNN-based methods are averaged
among 4 random seeds as well.

Points24

In the Points24 task, we directly collect 50k instruction-following expert data samples using a task
solver. See examples with and without CoT in Figure 28 and 29, respectively. Note that the supervised
fine-tuning data has a slightly different distribution as the states in the Points24 environment, since
the expert data always have a viable solution to 24, while not all states from Points24 has a viable
solution to 24.

ALFWorld

The data collection procedure of the alfworld embodied environment is slightly different than the
gym_cards, as we do not have solvers to generate the instruction-following data, even with the expert
text action. Therefore, we take a step back and directly use our prompt as presented in Figure 17 (or
Figure 30) to collect 1k episodes (around 45k) instruction-following data from GPT4-V [44] with the
CoT reasoning for the instruction-following fine-tuning with CoT. As for the case without CoT, we
directly clean the collected CoT by removing the CoT reasonings. See examples with and without
CoT in Figure 30 and 31, respectively.

Inputs:
Your are an expert in the ALFRED Embodied Environment. You are
also given the following text description of the current scene: ['You
arrive at loc 0. The cabinet 1 is open. On the cabinet 1, you see a pan
1, a kettle 1, a winebottle 1, a apple 1, a stoveknob 1, a stoveknob 2, a
stoveknob 3, a stoveknob 4, a knife 1, a saltshaker 1, and a bread 1.'].
Your task is to put a cool mug in cabinet. Your admissible actions of the
current situation are: ['go to countertop 1', 'go to cabinet 2', 'go to

NeurIPS Checklist

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the paper, we propose an end-to-end RL training framework for improving
a VLM agent’s decision-making capabilities. We claim that our method can improve a
VLM’s decision-making capabilities and we show the CoT reasoning appears as a crucial
component for performance improvement. All claims are justified in the experiment section
(Section 6).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided a paragraph to discuss the conclusions, limitations, and
future directions of our paper (Section 7). In particular, we have pointed out that we have
not extensively tried different prompts for the CoT reasoning, and our method currently
can only train the VLM on one task at a time. And we would like to leave them for future
studies.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.

31


---Page Break---
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This is an empirical paper, we do not have any theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have listed all details for reproducing our experiments in Appendix C.
We have also provided a detailed readme.md file in the supplementary for reproducing our
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our supplementary materials contain all of our codes, and we have provided a
detailed readme.md file in the supplementary for reproducing our experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided general descriptions of the tested tasks in Section 5. We
also have provided the general discussion of our experiments in Section 6. The details are
provided in Appendix C and D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

33


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
All of our experiments contain standard deviation in the training curves, all standard devi-
ations are calculated among 4 different random seeds, as specified in Appendix C.3. See
Figure 5, 6, 7, 18, and 19.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have reported such results for computation costs in Appendix C.3.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have read through the guidelines and we believe they are all satisfied to the
best of our understanding.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We proposed a method for end-to-end RL training on VLMs on vision based
decision-making tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our method does not lead to potential
negative societal impacts.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]

Justification: We majorly proposed a method for applying end-to-end RL training on VLMs,
which does not release any large models.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]

35


---Page Break---
Justification: We adopt the LLaVA-1.6-7b [35] as our initial model for RL training, we have
cited LLaVA properly throughout the paper and in our code (in the supplementary).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have prepared our own data for the supervised fine-tuning phase. And we
have anonymized the dataset for reproduction in the supplementary as well.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve any crowdsourcings and human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

36


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve any crowdsourcings and human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
