Abstract

We present a novel approach for test-time adaptation via online self-training, con-
sisting of two components. First, we introduce a statistical framework that detects
distribution shifts in the classifier’s entropy values obtained on a stream of unla-
beled samples. Second, we devise an online adaptation mechanism that utilizes
the evidence of distribution shifts captured by the detection tool to dynamically
update the classifier’s parameters. The resulting adaptation process drives the
distribution of test entropy values obtained from the self-trained classifier to match
those of the source domain, building invariance to distribution shifts. This approach
departs from the conventional self-training method, which focuses on minimizing
the classifier’s entropy. Our approach combines concepts in betting martingales and
online learning to form a detection tool capable of quickly reacting to distribution
shifts. We then reveal a tight relation between our adaptation scheme and optimal
transport, which forms the basis of our novel self-supervised loss. Experimental re-
sults demonstrate that our approach improves test-time accuracy under distribution
shifts while maintaining accuracy and calibration in their absence, outperforming
leading entropy minimization methods across various scenarios.

Introduction

The deployment of machine learning (ML) models in real-world settings presents a significant
challenge, as these models often encounter testing environments (target domains) that differ from
their training, source domain [1–15]. Consider, for example, an image recognition system employed
for medical diagnostic support [16–20], where the quality of images acquired during testing deviates
from the training data due to factors such as equipment degradation and novel illumination conditions.
ML models are sensitive to such distribution shifts, often resulting in performance deterioration,
which can be unexpected [15]. Ultimately, we want predictive models to dynamically adapt to new
testing environments without the laborious work required to annotate new, up-to-date labels.

Recognizing this pressing need, there has been a surge in the development of adaptation methodologies
to enhance test-time robustness to shifting distributions [21–28]. One commonly used approach
involves jointly training a model on both the source and target domains [29–34]. However, such
train-time adaptation methods assume access to unlabeled test data from the target domains, limiting
the ability to adapt the model to new domains that emerge during testing. To overcome this limitation,
test-time adaptation techniques offer strategies that dynamically update the model parameters as new
unlabeled test points become available. In particular, leading methodologies draw inspiration from

the relationship between the entropy of estimated class probabilities—a measure of confidence—and
model accuracy [35–43]. Empirical evidence highlights that lower entropy often corresponds to
higher accuracy, encouraging the development of self-supervised learning approaches that adjust
model parameters by minimizing the entropy loss or the cross-entropy through the assignment of
pseudo- or soft-labels to test points [44–48].

While test-time adaptation techniques have shown promise in enhancing test accuracy under domain
shifts, there is a caveat: minimizing entropy or related self-supervised loss functions without control
can lead to overconfident predictions, and may suffer from undesired, noisy model updates [49–
52]. In extreme cases, this approach may even cause the model to collapse and produce trivial
predictions [53, 54]. Indeed, without careful implementation and tuning, these techniques may not
improve—or could even reduce [34]—the predictive performance in realistic settings.

In this paper, we present a novel, statistically principled approach to test-time adaptation via self-
training. Our methodology is built upon two key pillars. First, we introduce an online statistical
framework that monitors and detects distribution shifts in the test data influencing the models’
predictions. We achieve this by sequentially testing whether the distribution of the classifier’s
entropy values obtained during testing deviates from the ones corresponding to the source domain.
Armed with this monitoring tool, we then devise an online adaptation mechanism that leverages the
accumulated evidence of distribution shifts to adaptively update model parameters. This mechanism
drives the distribution of the self-trained classifier’s entropy values, obtained on test data, to closely
match the distribution of entropy values when applying the original model to the source domain. As
a result, our proposed Protected Online Entropy Matching (POEM) method adapts the model on the
fly in a controlled manner: in the absence of a distribution shift, our approach has a “no-harm” effect
both on accuracy and calibration of the model, whereas under distribution shifts our experiments
demonstrate an improvement of the test time accuracy, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Contributions

(i) We present a sequential test for classification entropy drift detection, building on betting martin-
gales [55–57] and online learning optimization [58–60] to provably attain fast reactions to shifting
data. (ii) Inspired by [61], we show how to utilize the test martingale to analytically design a mapping
function that transports the classifier entropies obtained at test time to resemble those of the source
domain. Under certain assumptions, we establish connections between our online testing approach
and optimal transport [62] as a mechanism for distribution matching. (iii) This observation sets
the foundation of the entropy-matching loss function used in POEM. (iv) Numerical experiments
in both continual and single-shift settings demonstrate that our approach is competitive and often
outperforms strong benchmark methods that build on entropy minimization. These experiments
are conducted using commonly used predictive models (ViT [63] and ResNet [64]) on standard
benchmark datasets: ImageNet-C [65], CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and OfficeHome [66]. A software
package that implements our methods is available at https://github.com/yarinbar/poem.

Preliminaries

2.1
Problem setup

To formalize the problem, consider a K-class classification problem with labeled training data
(Xs
i , Y s
i )n
i=1 from a source domain, sampled i.i.d. from the source distribution P s
XY . Here, Xs ∈Rd
represents observed covariates and Y s ∈{1, . . . , K} is the corresponding label. During testing,
we encounter a stream of points Xt
j with unknown labels Y t
j , sampled from an unknown target
distribution P j
XY that may shift over time j = 1, 2, . . . . To define the shifting mechanism, let
Tj : Rd →Rd be an unknown corruption/shift function, resulting in test instances Xt
j = Tj(Xs)
with Xs being a fresh sample from P s. For instance, in datasets such as ImageNet-C, corruptions
involve modifications such as blur or changes in illumination applied to clean source images. While
such transformations alter the marginal P j
X distribution of the target domain, we assume that (i) the
labels obtained by an oracle classifier and (ii) the oracle’s prediction difficulty (measured by the
classifier’s entropy) for clean and corrupted test points remain the same [67].

2.2
Related work: test-time adaptation via self-training

Given a pre-trained classifier fˆθ trained on the source domain, leading test-time adaptation approaches
build on the idea of self-training to update the model parameters sequentially. Denote the adapted
classifier by fˆθ+ω, where ω represents the modification to the parameters of the original model ˆθ
obtained by self-training during testing. The adaptation process is typically initialized with j = 1
and ω1 = 0, and involves the following set of steps:

1. Observe a fresh test point Xt
j and predict its unknown label using fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j).

2. Update the model parameters in a direction that reduces the self-supervised loss, i.e.,

ωj+1 ←ωj −η∇ωℓself 
fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)

,

where the hyper-parameter η is the step size.
3. Set j ←j + 1 and return to step 1.

A common choice for ℓself in test-time adaptation methods is the entropy loss:

ℓent  
fˆθ+ω(x)

= −

K
X

y=1
fˆθ+ω(x)y log(fˆθ+ω(x)y),
(1)

where fˆθ+ω(x)y is the y-th entry of the classifier’s softmax layer; we omit the index j of ω for clarity.

While entropy minimization has been shown to enhance test-time robustness [36–43], it is also prone
to instabilities [49–51, 68]. For instance, enforcing fˆθ+ω(x)y = 1 for a fixed entry y minimizes ℓent,
but it collapses the classifier to make trivial predictions. To alleviate this, various strategies have
been proposed. For example, one approach is to avoid training on samples with high entropy [42], as
high entropy often correlates with erroneous pseudo labels. Another example is the utilization of a
fallback mechanism that resets the adapted model back to the original model fˆθ when the average
entropy becomes too small [43]. A more detailed review of test-time adaptation methods is given
in Appendix A. Importantly, this line of work underscores the limitations of entropy minimization
and highlights the need to better control its effect. This aligns with the goal of our work, which
offers a distinct, statistically grounded approach for test-time adaptation. While we also build
on the classifier’s entropy to form the adaptation mechanism, we could integrate any alternative
self-supervised loss in our online distributional matching scheme.

2.3
Testing by betting

A key component of our method is the proposal of an online test for distribution drift. The design of
this test follows the framework of testing-by-betting [69]. Intuitively, one can interpret this testing
framework as participating in a fair game. We begin with initial toy money, and at each time step, we
observe a new test point and place a bet against the null hypothesis we aim to test. If the bet turns out
to be correct, our wealth increases by the money we risked in the bet; otherwise, we lose, and our
wealth decreases accordingly. Mathematically, the wealth process is formulated as a non-negative
martingale, where a successful betting scheme is reflected in a growing martingale (wealth) trajectory,
offering progressively stronger statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. However, if the null
hypothesis is true, the game must be fair in the sense that it is unlikely to significantly grow our initial
capital, no matter how sophisticated our betting strategy may be. This implies that, under the null
hypothesis, it is unlikely that the martingale will grow significantly beyond its initial value.

The testing-by-betting framework is widely used in sequential settings. Notable examples include:
one and two sample tests [70, 71], independence and conditional independence tests [71–73], ex-
changeability tests [56, 74–78], and more [69, 79–92]. This framework is also used for change-point
detection and testing for uniformity [57, 93–95], related to our drift detection problem. We draw
inspiration from the protected probabilistic regression approach [61] that combines the probability
integral transform and betting martingales to improve the robustness of a cumulative distribution
function (CDF) estimator to distribution shift in the data. The experiments in [61] illustrate this
method’s ability to enhance the accuracy of a regression model, where this protection scheme assumes
access to new up-to-date labels. In contrast, we focus on a completely different setup where the labels
of the test points are unknown, showing how the protected regression approach can be generalized
to form a self-supervised loss function. In turn, we introduce two key contributions to test-time

adaptation via testing-by-betting. First, we present an adaptive online learning technique to optimize
the betting mechanism. Second, we pioneer the application of testing-by-betting in this domain.

Proposed method: protected online entropy matching (POEM)

3.1
Preview of our method

Let the random variable Zs = ℓent(fˆθ(Xs)) be the entropy value of the original classifier applied
to a fresh sample Xs from the source domain. We refer to this variable as the source entropy. In
addition, denote by Zt
j = ℓent(fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)), j = 1, 2, . . ., a sequence of entropy values generated
by the updated model, evaluated on a stream of unlabeled test data. We refer to Zt as the target
entropy. Our proposal uses the source and target entropies both to detect distribution shifts and adapt
the model to new testing environments without relying on up-to-date labeled data. The rationale
behind our method is as follows: when test data is sampled from the source distribution, there will
be no deviation between the source and target entropies, implying that there is no need to adapt the
model. However, statistical deviations between the source entropies Zs and target entropies Zt can
indicate that the model encounters test data different from the training distribution. This motivates us
to introduce a self-training framework that encourages the model to generate test-time entropies Zt
that closely resemble the source entropies Zs to build invariance to shifting data.

To achieve this goal, we utilize the testing-by-betting approach and formulate our adaptation scheme
as a game, in which we start with initial toy money and proceed as follows.

1. Place a bet against the null hypothesis that the unknown classifier entropy Zt
j of the upcoming
test point Xt
j will follow the same distribution as the source entropies Zs.

2. Observe the test point Xt
j, predict its label using the model fˆθ+ωj, and compute the classi-
fier’s entropy Zt
j = ℓent(fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)).

3. Given Zt
j, reveal the outcome of the bet using a betting function. If the bet is successful,
increase the accumulated wealth; otherwise, decrease it.
4. Leverage the betting function to obtain an adapted pseudo-entropy value ˜Zj that better
matches the distribution of Zs. The intuition here is that we derive ˜Zj in a way that would
reduce the toy money we would have gained if we had used the same betting strategy on ˜Zj.
5. Update the model parameters: obtain ωj+1 by taking a gradient step that reduces the
self-supervised matching loss:2

ℓmatch(Zt
j, ˜Zj) = 1

2(ℓent(fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)) −˜Zj)2.
(2)

6. Update the betting strategy for the next round and return to Step 1.

In the following sections, we describe in detail each component of the proposed adaptation scheme.
Before proceeding, however, we pause to highlight the advantages of the matching loss (2) over
entropy minimization.

3.2
Motivating example: entropy minimization vs. entropy matching

To facilitate the exposition of the proposed loss, it is useful to consider a toy, binary classification
example with a one-dimensional input X in which we have oracle access both to the source P s
XY and
a fixed target distribution P t
XY that does not vary over time. We commence by generating training
data from P s
XY , where P(Y = 1) = P(Y = −1) and P s
X|Y = N(Y s, 1). See Figure 1 for an
illustration of the source distribution. Throughout this experiment, we set the pre-trained Gaussian
classifier fˆθ to be the Bayes optimal one for which ˆθ = 0, and during test-time we optimize the
parameter ω of the updated classifier. Since ˆθ = 0, in this case fˆθ+ω is simplified to fω. Further
implementation details are provided in Appendix F.

As mentioned before, one of the advantages of our approach is its “no-harm” effect, i.e., when
P s
XY = P t
XY we ideally want to keep the decision boundary of the classifier intact. The red curve

in Figure 1 illustrates the entropy matching risk EXt[ℓmatch(Z, ˜Z)] as a function of the classifier
parameter ω. In this synthetic case, the ideal entropy matching risk can be evaluated since we
have access to the generating distribution: we can obtain the ideal pseudo-entropy ˜Zt, given by
˜Z = F −1
s
(Ft(Zt; fω)), where Fs and Ft are the CDF functions of the source and target entropy
values, respectively; the formula above is nothing but the optimal transport map. Of course, in the
practical online setting we consider in this work, Ft is unknown and varies over time. In fact, this is
also true in the case studied here as the distribution of Zt = fω(Xt) varies with ω, highlighting the
importance of our online, adaptive testing procedure. Indeed, the ω obtained by our online adaptation
scheme (POEM) minimizes the entropy matching risk and remains close to 0, as desired.

Meanwhile, the black curve in Figure 1 illustrates the values of the entropy risk EXt[ℓent(Zt)] for
varying ω. In contrast with our approach, the ω that minimizes the entropy risk is far from the optimal
classifier. This approach results in a collapse towards a trivial classifier that always predicts −1,
regardless of the value of Xt. Moving to an out-of-distribution scenario, where we consider test data
sampled from a shifted version of the two Gaussians such that Y t = Y s and Xt = Xs+1. Following
the bottom panel in Figure 1, it is evident that by minimizing the proposed entropy matching risk,
the accuracy of the original (not adapted) classifier is effectively restored. In contrast, the entropy
minimization paradigm once again collapses the model to make trivial predictions.

3.3
Online drift detection

We now turn to introduce a rigorous monitoring tool that is capable of detecting whether the distribu-
tion of the adapted classifier’s entropy values Zt, obtained at test time, deviate from Zs—the source
entropies obtained by applying the original model to the source data. To detect such shifts, we assume
that we have access to Fs, the CDF of the source entropy values Zs = ℓent(fˆθ(Xs)). In practice,
we estimate this CDF using holdout unlabeled samples Xs from the source distribution. Armed
with Fs, we then apply the probability integral transform [96], allowing us to convert any sequence
of i.i.d. entropy values from the source distribution Zs
1, Zs
2, . . . into a sequence of i.i.d. uniform
random variables Fs(Zs
1), Fs(Zs
2), . . . on the [0, 1] interval. Therefore, if we observe a sequence
Fs(Zt
1), Fs(Zt
2), . . . of i.i.d. uniform variables at test time, we can infer that the target entropy
distribution matches the source entropy distribution. Thus, if the sequence of transformed variables
Fs(Zt
1), Fs(Zt
2), . . . deviates from the uniform distribution, we can infer that the corresponding target
domain samples Zt
1, Zt
2, . . . differ from the source distribution. This observation lies at the core of
our monitoring tool [61].

Specifically, we leverage the testing-by-betting approach to design a sequential test for the following
null hypothesis:
H0 : uj ≜Fs(Zt
j) ∼U[0, 1],
∀j ∈N,
(3)

5


---Page Break---
where Zt
j = ℓent(fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)). In words, we continuously monitor the sequence of random variables
u1, u2, . . . and test whether these deviate from the uniform null. We do so by formulating a test
martingale, defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Test Martingale). A random process {Sj : j ∈N, S0 = 1} is a test martingale for the
null hypothesis H0 if it satisfies the following:

1. Sj ≥0 ∀j ∈N.

2. {Sj : j ∈N0} is a martingale under H0, i.e., EH0[Sj | S1, . . . , Sj−1] = Sj−1.

The martingale can be thought of as the wealth process in the game-theoretical interpretation of the
test, obtained by betting toy money against H0 as new data points arrive. We initialize this game with
S0 = 1, and update the wealth process as follows [61]:

Sj(uj) ≜Sj−1 · b(uj)
where
b(uj) = 1 + ϵj(uj −0.5).
(4)
Above, b(u) ∈[0, 2] is the betting function. The betting variable ϵj ∈[−2, 2] controls how aggressive
the bet is, and it can be determined based on past observations u1, . . . , uj−1, as we detail later in
this section. However, before introducing our strategy to update ϵj over time, we should first discuss
the properties of the betting function b(uj). The idea behind this choice is that we sequentially
test whether the sequence of u1, . . . , uj observed up to time step j has mean 0.5. Indeed, if the
null is true, EH0[u] = 0.5 and thus EH0[b(u)] = 1. As a result, under the null, the martingale is
unlikely to grow significantly beyond its initial value—this is a consequence of Ville’s inequality;
see Appendix D. However, if the null is false, we can gather evidence against the uniform null
hypothesis by placing more aggressive bets, especially when past observed values u1, . . . , uj−1
deviate significantly from 0.5. This highlights the role of ϵj, controlling the value and direction of
our wagers in each round, betting on whether uj would be over/under 0.5. Following (4), when ϵj
and (uj −0.5) have the same sign, we win the bet and obtain b(uj) > 1. This implies that our capital
increase as Sj(uj) := Sj−1 · b(uj). Notice that, in this case, a larger ϵj (in absolute value) will
allow us to increase the capital more rapidly, resulting in a more powerful test. However, if ϵj and
(uj −0.5) have different signs, we lose the bet and obtain b(uj) < 1. Here, a larger ϵj would incur a
more significant loss of capital. The challenge in choosing ϵj lies in the restriction that ϵj can only be
determined based on past experience, i.e., we must set its value without looking at the new uj. This
restriction is crucial to ensure the validity of the martingale, as detailed in the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The random process presented in (4) is a valid test martingale for H0 (3).

The proof is given in Appendix C.1; it is a well-known result, see, e.g., [61]. This property is crucial
to form the proposed online distributional matching mechanism, introduced in the next section.
Appendix D provides further details on how the test martingale is used for distribution shift detection.

We now turn to present an adaptive approach to set the betting variable ϵj in a manner that enables
powerful detection of drifting target entropies. This is especially important given the dynamic nature
of both the target data and the continuous, online updates of the model. To achieve this, we adopt an
online learning technique to learn ϵj from past observations, with the goal of maximizing the wealth
by minimizing the negative log of the wealth process up to step j [70]:

−log(Sj(uj)) = −log

jY

τ=1
bτ(uτ) = −

j
X

τ=1
log(bτ(uτ)) = −

j
X

τ=1
log(1 + ϵτ(uτ −0.5)).
(5)

This formulation allows us to learn how to predict ϵj using past samples via gradient descent [70].

Specifically, our optimization approach relies on the scale-free online gradient descent (SF-OGD)
algorithm [59]. Importantly, extending SF-OGD to our setting is not straightforward, since ϵj must
be in the range of [−2, 2] to form a valid test martingale. In the interest of space, we present this
algorithm and its theoretical analysis in Appendix B and only highlight here its key feature. SF-OGD
allows us to attain an anytime regret guarantee, which is presented formally in Theorem 1 of the
Appendix. This guarantee bounds the difference between the negative log of the wealth process
(i) obtained by the predicted ϵt over time horizon 1 ≤t ≤j, and (ii) obtained by the best betting
variable ϵ⋆that can only be calculated in hindsight, after looking at the data up to time 1 ≤t ≤j.
Informally, our theory shows this regret is bounded by c ·
√

t for all 1 ≤t ≤j, where the constant c
depends on the problem parameters; it is formulated precisely in Theorem 1. In turn, the anytime
regret guarantee confirms that our SF-OGD approach effectively learns ϵj, capturing the dynamic
changes of both the target distribution and the model fˆθ+ωj in a fully online setting.

3.4
Online model adaptation

Having established a powerful betting strategy, we now turn to show how to transform the test
martingale {Sj : j ∈N} into a sequence of adapted pseudo-entropy values ˜Z1, ˜Z2, ... that better
match the distribution of Zs. In what follows, we describe an algorithm to obtain ˜Zj, which draws
inspiration from [61], and then connect this procedure to optimal transport.

Our adaptation scheme leverages the fact that any valid betting function is essentially a likelihood
ratio [61, 82]. This property implies that our betting function b(uj) = 1 + ϵj(uj −0.5) satisfies

b(uj) = dQ(uj)

dG(uj),
(6)

where dQ(uj) and dG(uj) are the densities of some alternative distribution Q and the null distribution
G, respectively. In our case, the null distribution G is the uniform distribution Uniform(0, 1), and the
alternative distribution Q can be intuitively thought of as an approximation of the unknown target
entropy’s CDF; we formalize this intuition hereafter. Leveraging this likelihood ratio interpretation,
we follow [61] and extract the alternative distribution Q by re-writing (6) as dQ(uj) = b(uj)·dG(uj)
and computing the integral:

Q(uj) =
Z uj

0
b(v)dG(v)dv =
Z uj

0
b(v) · 1 · dv = 1

2ϵj · u2
j + (1 −ϵj

2 ) · uj.
(7)

Above, we used the fact that the null density is dG(v) equals 1 over the support [0, 1]. Having access
to Q, we can compute the adapted ˜uj := Q(uj) that can be intuitively interpreted as the result of
applying the probability integral transform to Zt
j using the estimated target entropy CDF. With this
intuition in place, we can further convert ˜uj into a pseudo-entropy value ˜Zt
j that better matches
the distribution of the source entropies. This is obtained by applying the inverse source CDF to
˜uj, resulting in ˜Zj = F −1
s
(Q(uj)). Observe that we assume here that Fs is invertible, however, in
practice, we compute the pseudo-inverse of Fs.

To connect the adaptation scheme presented above to the optimal transport map between the target
and source entropies, it is useful to consider an ideal case where we use the log-optimal bet for testing
a point null [82]. In our case, the null hypothesis is that the distribution of the source entropies Zs
and target entropies Zt
j is the same, which implies H0 in (3). Following [82], the optimal bet for our
null is the true likelihood ratio, formulated as

bopt
Z (Zt
j) ≜dF j
t (Zt
j)
dFs(Zt
j) ,
(8)

where F j
t is the CDF of the target entropy Zt
j. To align with (6), we can equivalently write bopt
Z (Zt
j)
as a betting function that gets uj as an input [61, Lemma 1]:

bopt
Z (Zt
j) = bopt
Z (F −1
s
(uj)) = dF j
t (F −1
s
(uj))
dFs(F −1
s
(uj)) ≜dQopt(uj)

dGopt(uj) = bopt
u (uj).
(9)

Notably, this optimal betting function is infeasible to compute in practice, as F j
t is unknown. Yet,
it implicitly suggests that more powerful betting functions could result in a better estimate of the
target entropy CDF. Also, the optimal betting function reveals an important property of our adaptation
scheme, formally given below.
Proposition 2. Let Xt
j be a fresh sample from the target domain with its corresponding Zt
j =
ℓent(fˆθ+ω(Xt
j)) and uj = Fs(Zt
j). Assume Fs is invertible and Zt
j is continuous, and suppose the
betting function represents the true likelihood ratio (9). Then, the adapted ˜Zt
j = F −1
s
(Qopt(uj)) is
the optimal transport map from target to source entropies with respect to the Wasserstein distance.

The proof of this proposition builds on [61, Lemma 1] and is provided in Appendix C.4. This result
highlights that our online, martingale-based adaptation scheme is grounded in optimal transport
principles. This, in turn, provides a principled way to minimize the discrepancy between probability
distributions. Leveraging this connection, the entropy matching loss function (2), which we employ
to self-train the model, can be understood as minimizing the discrepancy between the entropy

distributions of the source and target domains. This implies that our loss function aligns the model’s
predictions across these domains. This connection also explains the “no-harm” effect of the proposed
loss. When P s
XY = P t
XY we get that Qopt(uj) = Gopt(uj) = uj in the ideal case of (9), implying
that ˜Zt
j = Zt
j. In practice, considering the betting function from (4), we anticipate that ϵj will be
close to zero thanks to our online optimization scheme, which, in turn, results in Q(uj) ≈uj in (7).

Putting it all together

Algorithm 2 in the Appendix summarizes the entire adaptation process of POEM. This algorithm
starts by computing the empirical CDF ˆFs of the source entropies to estimate Fs, using unlabeled
holdout samples from the source domain (line 6). The betting and pseudo-entropy estimation steps
are presented in lines 12–14. Observe that in line 14 we use the pseudo-inverse of ˆFs to obtain ˜Zj.
The algorithm then proceeds to adapt the classifier’s parameters in a direction that minimizes our
self-supervised loss (line 15). Specifically, we only update the parameters of the normalization layers
ω of the classifier fˆθ+ω, which is a common practice in the test-time adaptation literature [41–43].
The self-training step is done by minimizing a variation of the entropy matching loss ℓmatch (2):

ℓmatch++
λ
(Zt
j, ˜Zj) = ℓmatch(Zt
j, ˜Zj) ·
1[Zt
j < λ]
exp {2 · (Zt
j −λ)}, where Zt
j = ℓent(fˆθ+ωj(Xt
j)).
(10)

The above loss function includes an additional sample-filtering 1[Zt
j < λ] and sample-weighting
1/ exp{2 · (Zt
j −λ)} components, where λ > 0 is a pre-defined thresholding parameter. The sample-
filtering idea is widely used in this literature [42, 43], as the predictions of samples with high entropy
examples tend to be inaccurate. Aligning with this intuition, the sample-weighting gives a higher
weight to samples with low entropies [42]. Finally, we predict a new betting parameter ϵj for the next
iteration by applying an SF-OGD step (line 16).

Experiments

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of POEM across a diverse range of datasets and scenarios
commonly used in test-time adaptation literature. Our experiments span ImageNet, ImageNet-C,
CIFAR10-C, and CIFAR100-C datasets for evaluating the robustness to shifts induced by corruptions,
and the Office-Home dataset for domain adaptation. We study the performance of our method in both
single-shift and continual-shift settings. Our evaluation demonstrates that POEM is highly competitive
with leading baseline test-time adaptation methods in terms of accuracy and runtime. In the interest
of space, this section focuses on the results for the ImageNet dataset, as it is the most challenging one
among those considered. Details and results for the experiments on CIFAR and Office-Home datasets
are provided in Appendices F.3 and F.4, respectively.

Throughout this section we use the test set of ImageNet to form our in-distribution dataset, and utilize
ImageNet-C—which contains 15 different types of corruptions at five increasing severity levels—to
simulate various out-of-distribution scenarios. Notably, since the images in ImageNet-C are variations
of the same images from the ImageNet test set, our experiments simulate a realistic out-of-distribution
test set by including only a single corrupted version of each image. To demonstrate the versatility of
POEM, we consider two pre-trained classifiers fˆθ of different architectures: Vision Transformer (ViT)
[63] with layer norm (LN) and ResNet50 [64] with group norm (GN). We compare POEM to four
leading entropy minimization methods—TENT [41], EATA [42], SAR [43], and COTTA [97]—using
code provided by the authors. Importantly, all adaptation methods update only the normalization
parameters (LN/GN) of the model, ensuring a fair comparison. Following [43], we employ a fully
online setting with a batch size of 1, in which the model is updated after observing a new test sample;
see Appendix F.2 for implementation details and choice of hyper-parameters. In the interest of space,
we defer the results obtained by the ResNet classifier to Appendix F.2.1 and focus here on the results
obtained by the ViT model.

Continual shifts
Inspired by [97, 98], we evaluate our approach in a continual setup in which
sudden distribution shifts occur during testing. To simulate this, we create a test set of 15,000 samples
by randomly selecting 1,000 samples from each corruption type at a fixed severity level (a corruption
segment) and concatenating all 15 segments to form the test data. We apply all adaptation methods

Figure 2: Continual test-time adaptation on ImageNet-C with a ViT model. Top: Per-corruption
accuracy with a corruption segment size of 1,000 examples. Results are obtained over 10 independent
trials; error bars are tiny. Bottom left and center: Severity shift—low (1) to high (5) and back to low
(left), and high (5) to low (1) and back to high (center). To improve the readability here, we only
present POEM, the best-performing baseline method (EATA), and the no-adapt approach. Bottom
right: Mean accuracy under continual corruptions as a function of the corruption segment size.

in combination with a ViT model and present the results in Figure 2. Following the bottom panel
in that figure, one can see that POEM achieves higher accuracy than all of the benchmark methods.
Next, we investigate how quickly our method adapts the model to new shifts by varying the segment
size of each corruption. As shown in Figure 2 (bottom right), POEM exhibits faster adaptation than
the baseline methods. It successfully enhances the accuracy of the pre-trained model with as few as
100 examples per corruption (test set of size 1,500) as well as with longer adaptation using 2,000
examples per corruption (test set of size 30,000). Finally, we explore another realistic scenario
of continual adaptation by varying the severity level every 1,000 samples while keeping a fixed
corruption type. The bottom left and center panels in Figure 2 show that POEM outperforms the best
baseline method (EATA) in this setting as well. Lastly, similar experiments conducted with a ResNet
model are presented in Figure 5 in the Appendix, showing that our method attains faster adaptation
and superior accuracy than the baseline methods.

Single shift
We now consider a scenario with a single corruption type of a fixed severity level, which
follows [41, 43, 99]. Table 1 summarizes the average results across all corruptions for severity level 5,
demonstrating that POEM achieves an average accuracy of 67.36% for the ViT model, outperforming
the best baseline method (EATA) with an absolute average accuracy gap of 3.22%. A detailed
breakdown by corruption type for each classifier is provided in Table 2 in the Appendix. Notably,
POEM outperforms all benchmark methods on all corruption types for ViT, while achieving higher test
accuracy in 9 out of the 15 corruption types for the ResNet model.

In distribution
In this setting, we apply all methods on the validation set of the ImageNet dataset.
Following Table 3 in the Appendix, all the methods maintain a similar accuracy as the original model,
however, the baseline methods tend to increase the expected calibration error (ECE) [68, 100] and
unnecessarily modify the model’s parameters, as measured by ∥ω∥F
2 . In contrast, following Figure 3
(left panel), POEM exhibits minimal changes both for ECE and model parameters, as desired. Figure 6
in the Appendix leads to similar conclusions for the ResNet model.

Additional experiments on ImageNet, including ablation study
The right panel of Figure 3 plots
the value of the betting parameter ϵ over time, for both in- and out-of-distribution scenarios. Observe
how ϵ remains near zero under the in-distribution setting, explaining the minimal change in accuracy,
ECE, and model’s parameters ∥ω∥2
F , presented in the left panel of Figure 3. By contrast, when

Figure 3: In-distribution experiment on ImageNet (left panel): calibration error (ECE [100])
versus ∥ω∥2
F —a metric that evaluates the classifier’s parameters deviation from the original ViT
model. Lower values on both axes are better. Results are averaged across 10 independent trials;
standard errors and accuracy of each method are reported in Table 3 in the appendix. The behavior
of the betting parameter (right panel): the value of ϵ is presented as a function of time for both in-
and out-of-distribution experiments (a single shift, two severity levels).

considering out-of-distribution test data of a single shift, we can see that ϵ is high at the beginning
and gradually reduces over time, indicating that the self-training process adapts the model to the new
environment. A similar behavior is observed for the ResNet model; see Figure 6 in the Appendix.
This conclusion is further supported by Figure 7 in the Appendix, showing that the CDF of the
target entropies of the adapted ResNet model nearly matches the CDF of the source entropies. In
Figure 4 of the Appendix we show how the martingale can powerfully detect shifts—even a minor one
(brightness with severity level 1)—and also show how our adaptation mechanism gradually limits the
martingale’s growth. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study, comparing the test accuracy of POEM using
two loss functions: ℓmatch (2) and ℓmatch++ (10). Table 4 in the Appendix presents these results for a
single shift scenario, averaged over 15 corruptions of ImageNet-C at the highest severity level. Both
losses improve the original model accuracy, with ℓmatch++ showing better adaptation performance.

Experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR100-C, and OfficeHome datasets, sensitivity study, and
runtime comparisons
Appendices F.3 and F.4 present experiments on these additional datasets,
leading to similar conclusions about the competitive adaptation accuracy of POEM compared to
baseline methods. Notably, Appendix F.3 includes experiments on both relatively short and long
adaptation streams, with lengths of 15,000 and 112,500 samples, respectively. These experiments also
include a sensitivity study on the learning rate η used for self-training the model, showing that POEM
exhibits greater stability across different learning rate values compared to SAR and TENT. Additionally,
these experiments show that POEM’s runtime is comparable to TENT and EATA, and faster than SAR.

Discussion

We introduced a novel, martingale-based approach for test-time adaptation that drives the test-time
entropies of the self-trained model to match the distribution of source entropies. We validated our
approach with numerical experiments, demonstrating that: (i) under in-distribution settings, POEM
maintains the performance of the source model while avoiding overconfident predictions, a crucial
advantage over entropy minimization methods; (ii) in relatively short out-of distribution test periods,
our approach achieves faster adaptation than entropy minimization methods, which is attributed to
our betting scheme that quickly reacts to distribution shifts; and (iii) in extended test periods, POEM
achieves comparable adaptation performance and stability to strong baseline methods.

One limitation of our method is the requirement for holdout unlabeled source domain data to estimate
the source CDF. Notably, this CDF is pre-computed offline, and at test time we do not require
additional access to source data, similar to EATA’s requirements. Another limitation of our approach
is the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the self-training learning rate η. However, our sensitivity
study showed that our method is fairly robust to this choice, especially compared to baseline methods.
Lastly, similar to other experimental works, we anticipate that POEM may fail to improve accuracy in
settings that we have not explored, especially when facing an aggressive shift. Yet, our monitoring
tool can detect such distribution shifts, which is an important mechanism that does not appear in
other test-time adaptation methods.

Future directions are discussed in Section G of the Appendix. Lastly, we note that while the goal
of this paper is to enhance the robustness of ML to unseen environments, there are many potential
societal consequences of our method, similar to other works that aim to advance this field.

Additional related work: test-time adaptation

As discussed in the main manuscript, entropy minimization is known to be effective for test time
adaptation. However, the works in [42, 43] demonstrate that samples with high entropy loss can
lead to noisy or overly aggressive updates of model parameters. To address this issue, [42, 43] filter
out high-entropy samples, and [43] also employs gradient clipping to stabilize self-training. These
algorithmic modifications emphasize the importance of controlling the minimization of the entropy
loss, which greatly aligns with the goal of our work. In our framework, we also use entropy as a
guiding force for self-training. However, instead of directly minimizing the entropy, our approach
focuses on matching the distribution of the entropy losses at test time with that of the source domain.
Notably, our method is versatile and can accommodate alternative choices beyond entropy, such as
Tsallis entropy [101, 102] or cross-entropy evaluated with a pseudo-label [103–105] in place of the
unknown true label. We leave the exploration of these alternative options for future work.

Another concern in test-time adaptation frameworks is the continuous learning mechanism, which
often leads to performance degradation on in-distribution data. To address this challenge, EATA
[42] introduces an anti-forgetting strategy that optimizes the model by focusing on the reliability
of samples and incorporates a weight regularizer to further improve stability. In our work, instead
of relying on weight regularization, we preserve in-distribution performance through a “no-harm”
approach, ensuring minimal model updates where no distribution shifts have occurred.

A crucial aspect of self-training is the selection of model parameters ω to update. A widely adopted
practice is to update the parameters of the normalization layers. This constraint plays a vital role in
mitigating overfitting, which is imperative to prevent the model from collapsing and making trivial
predictions. The TENT [41] approach demonstrates that minimizing entropy by modifying only the
batch normalization parameters can significantly enhance out-of-distribution performance. However,
TENT requires working with large batches, which can limit the ability to handle mixed-distribution
shifts within a single batch—for instance, a batch containing a subset of blurred images, another
subset of noisy images, and so on. To alleviate this issue, the SAR method suggests updating the group
or layer normalization parameters, unlocking the use of smaller batch sizes. In turn, this adjustment
enhances the model’s adaptivity under mixed-distribution shifts. In our work, we follow this line
of research and update the layer normalization parameters; however, we optimize a completely
different loss function, aiming to match the distributions of the source and target entropies. While
there are works that suggest matching between the source and target distributions [106–108], this
alignment is often affected by the batch size. To stress this point, one might consider using an
out-of-the-box distributional matching loss function (e.g., Maximum Mean Discrepancy [109]) to
align the source and target entropy distributions, however, this approach requires large batches to
obtain an effective estimation. Our approach accumulates the evidence for distribution shift in an
online fashion, allowing us to use small batches, even of size one as we do in our experiments.

The work in [97] tackles the challenge of test-time adaptation where a pre-trained model must adjust
to a continuously changing target domain during inference, without access to original training data.
This approach, named CoTTA, utilizes weight-averaged and augmentation-averaged pseudo-labels to
improve label accuracy and reduce error accumulation. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, CoTTA
intermittently reverts some neurons to their initial states. In contrast with CoTTA, our method operates
under the assumption of no access to transformations/augmentations during testing. Employing such
augmentations may further improve the performance of POEM, and we leave this exploration for future
work.

Learning the betting variable online

In this section we present and analyze our online approach to learn the betting variable ϵj, which
relies on the SF-OGD algorithm [59]. The complete algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.

In the following analysis, we assume that the betting variable that attains the fastest growth of the
capital in hindsight, after observing uτ, is in the range [−D, D] ⊂[−2, 2]. We denote this variable
by Eτ ∈{−D, +D}, which can be computed via a simple closed-form expression, given by

Eτ = D · sign(uτ −0.5).
(11)

With this in place, we define the clip-aware loss function, which we will use to formulate the update
rule for ϵτ that maximizes the capital:

18


---Page Break---
L(Eτ, ϵτ) = −
log(1 + Eτ(uτ −0.5))
if Eτ · ϵτ > 0 and |ϵτ| > D
log(1 + ϵτ(uτ −0.5))
otherwise.
(12)

In plain words, when ϵτ is out of range but has the same sign as Eτ, we clip the betting variable with
the maximal value allowed (D or −D) that would increase the wealth. Otherwise, the loss is equal to
the log of the bet, obtained with ϵτ.

At each step τ of the algorithm, we first predict the value of ϵτ, then observe uτ, which allows us to
compute Eτ. Therefore, after observing uτ we can compute the (sub)gradient of (12):

∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ) = −
0
if Eτ · ϵτ > 0 and |ϵτ| > D
(uτ −0.5)/(1 + ϵτ(uτ −0.5))
otherwise.
(13)

Armed with ∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ) we are ready to perform the SF-OGD step, formulated as:

ϵτ+1 = ϵτ −γ
∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ)
pPτ
t=1(∇ϵLt(Et, ϵt))2 ,
(14)

where γ > 0 is a learning rate. Lemma 1 below states that ϵτ is indeed bounded.
Lemma 1. The SF-OGD algorithm with a learning rate 0 < γ < 2 −D and initialization ϵ1 =
[−D −γ, D + γ] satisfies ϵτ ∈[−D −γ, D + γ] for all 1 ≤τ ≤j.

Proof is in Appendix C.2. Following Lemma 1, we conclude that we must set the learning rate γ in
the range 0 < γ < 2 −D to ensure that ϵτ is in the range (−2, 2). The latter is crucial to formulate a
valid betting function (4).

Building on the analysis of SF-OGD, the following proposition states that this algorithm achieves a
regret bound on the loss in (12), where the regret function is defined as

Reg(j) =

τ=1
L(Eτ, ϵτ) −
sup
ϵ⋆∈[−D,D]

Above, ϵ⋆is the betting parameter that minimizes the loss in hindsight, over the time horizon
1 ≤t ≤j.
Theorem 1. [Theorem 4 by Orabona and pál [59]; Proposition A.2 by Bhatnagar et al. [110]]
Suppose that ϵ⋆∈[−D, D]. Then, SF-OGD with Eτ ∈{−D, D} for all 1 ≤τ ≤j, learning rate
0 < γ < 2 −D, and any initialization ϵ1 ∈[−D −γ, D + γ] achieves

Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1

Proof.
Sj ≥0 for all j ∈N since uj ∈[0, 1] and ϵj ∈[−2, 2] by definition.
{Sj : j ∈N} is a martingale under H0 since

EH0[Sj | S1, ..., Sj−1] = Sj−1 · EH0[b(uj) | S1, ..., Sj−1]
= Sj−1 · (1 + ϵj · EH0[uj −0.5 | S1, ..., Sj−1]) = Sj−1,

where the second transition holds since ϵj depends only on {S1, ..., Sj−1}, and the latter since
EH0[uj −0.5 | S1, ..., Sj−1] = 0.

19


---Page Break---
C.2
Proof of Lemma 1

Proof. Leveraging the symmetry of the problem, it suffices to study the setting in which ϵτ ≥0. Also,
without loss of generality, we assume that ∇ϵL1(E1, ϵ1) ̸= 0 for the first iteration of the algorithm; if
this does not hold we can always remove these samples until reaching an observation with a non-zero
gradient. To prove the result, we consider the following cases that can occur when optimizing (12).

• Case 1: 0 ≤ϵτ ≤D.

• Case 2: ϵτ > D and ϵτ · Eτ ≥0.

• Case 3: ϵτ > D and ϵτ · Eτ ≤0.

We start by analyzing Case 1. Recall that 0 ≤uτ ≤1 and that Eτ ∈{−D, D}. Now, following (13)
we can conclude that the gradient of the loss L(Eτ, ϵτ) is bounded ∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ) ∈[−
1
2−D,
1
2−D].
By recalling the update rule in (14), we get:

|ϵτ+1 −ϵτ| = γ


∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ)
pPτ
t=1(∇ϵLt(Et, ϵt))2

 ≤γ.
(16)

With this in place, we can conclude that if ϵτ+1 ≥ϵτ, then

ϵτ+1 ≤ϵτ + γ ≤D + γ.

Otherwise, ϵτ+1 ≤ϵτ, then
D ≥ϵτ ≥ϵτ+1 ≥ϵτ −γ ≥−γ.

Above, we used the fact that 0 ≤ϵτ ≤D under Case 1. In sum, we showed that −γ ≤ϵτ+1 ≤D+γ.

We now turn to analyze Case 2. Under the assumptions of this case ∇ϵL(Eτ, ϵτ) = 0 and thus
ϵτ+1 = ϵτ, i.e., the value of the betting parameter will not be modified. To bound the value of ϵτ+1,
we note that we can encounter ϵτ > D as a result of updating the betting parameter in Case 1, but in
this scenario, we already know that −γ ≤ϵτ ≤D + γ. We can also reach Case 2 at the initialization,
but then ϵ1 <= D + γ and thus bounded. Lastly, another entry point to Case 2 is from Case 3,
however, we show below that the latter satisfies that D −γ ≤ϵτ ≤D + γ.

Lastly, we study Case 3, which can be reached from Case 1 or Case 2. However, in Case 2 ϵτ+1 = ϵτ,
so we can concentrate only on the scenario where Case 3 is reached from Case 1, but we already
showed that ϵt ≤D + γ in this case. Lastly, we can face Case 3 when ϵ1 > D, however, it is
bounded ϵ1 <= D + γ by the Lemma’s assumption. Hence, following (13), the gradient is bounded
∇ϵLt(Et, ϵt) ∈[−
1
2−D−γ ,
1
2−D−γ ]. Further, the loss can be improved only by reducing the value of
ϵτ, and thus the SF-OGD step would result in ϵτ+1 ≤ϵτ. This implies that ϵτ −ϵτ+1 ≤γ, according
to (16). In turn, by recalling that D + γ ≥ϵτ > D , we conclude that

D + γ ≥ϵτ ≥ϵτ+1 ≥ϵτ −γ > D −γ.

To summarize, the analysis of the cases above indicates that ϵτ ∈[−D −γ, D +γ] for all 1 ≤τ ≤j,
as desired.

The second inequality holds by following the proof of Lemma 1, showing that ∇ϵLt(Et, ϵt) ∈

2−D−γ ,

2−D−γ ]. The proof of the first inequality is a direct consequence of [59, Theorem 4] or
[110, Proposition A.2], and thus omitted. Notable, we can directly invoke [59, Theorem 4] as (i) the
loss function Lτ(·) = L(Eτ, ·) in (12) is convex; and (ii) the betting variable ϵτ ∈[−D −γ, D + γ]
is bounded for all 1 ≤τ ≤j due Lemma 1.

C.4
Proof of Proposition 2

Proof. Since we assume that Fs is invertible and Zt
j is continuous, we can conclude that Fs is a
smooth bijection function. This allows us to invoke [61, Lemma 1], which states that if F j
t is the
CDF corresponding to the density function dF j
t , and the mapping Fs is a smooth bijection, then the
CDF Qopt(u) = F j
t (F −1
s
(u)) as in (9). With this in place, we can write

˜Zt
j = F −1
s
(Qopt(uj)) = F −1
s
(F j
t (F −1
s
(uj))) = F −1
s
(F j
t (F −1
s
(Fs(Zt
j)))) = F −1
s
(F j
t (Zt
j)),

where the second equality holds due [61, Lemma 1] and the third equality stems from the definition of
uj, being uj = Fs(Zt
j). We conclude the proof by observing that the mapping ˜Zt
j = F −1
s
(F j
t (Zt
j))
is the optimal transport map from the target to the source distribution w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance.
This is because Zt
j is a continuous, one-dimensional random variable, with an invertible CDF
Fs [111].

Using martingales to detect distribution shifts

Figure 4: Martingale behaviour with and without adaptation and on in-distribution data.
Visualization of three scenarios: (1) out-of-distribution data (ImageNet-C, brightness level 1) without
adaptation, (2) the same out-of-distribution data with online adaptation, and (3) in-distribution data
(ImageNet) all on ResNet50. The top panel shows the martingale value, that is, the accumulated
capital (in log scale) over time, while the bottom panel shows the corresponding betting variable ϵ.

Recall that we established in Proposition 1 the validity of the martingale defined in (4). In this section,
we describe how a valid test martingale can be used to detect distribution shifts with a type-I error
guarantee. This this end, consider a test martingale sequence denoted by {Sj : j ∈N0} under the null
hypothesis H0 of no distribution shift (3). Ville’s inequality [112] plays a crucial role in bounding
the probability of this martingale exceeding a specific threshold under H0. Specifically, for any value
of α between 0 and 1, Ville’s inequality states the following:

PH0


∃j ≥1 : Sj ≥1

α


≤αEH0[S0] = α.
(17)

Suppose we set a significance level α = 0.01. The above inequality states that under the assumption
of no distribution shift, the martingale’s value will exceed a threshold of 1/α (in this case, 100) with
a probability of at most α = 0.01. This bound on the probability allows us to simultaneously control
the type-I error across all time steps. This implies that we can declare that we face a distribution shift
if the martingale value pass the threshold 1/α. For instance, if we set the threshold to 100 or higher,
the type-I error is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 0.01.

Figure 4 top panel offers a visual representation of the martingale’s behavior under different scenarios;
see Appendix F for implementation details. As discussed above, under the null hypothesis of no
distribution shift, the martingale is expected to remain lower than 1 with high probability. This is
precisely what we observe in the in-distribution data scenario—the martingale value remains under

21


---Page Break---
1. Here, we consider the ImageNet dataset, where we applied a pre-trained ResNet50 model on the
ImageNet validation set.

In contrast, when the pre-trained model is applied to corrupted, out-of-distribution data (ImageNet-C),
the martingale value deviates significantly from 1, reaching levels of up to 10200. This substantial
increase validates the presence of a distribution shift. Interestingly, Figure 4 also reveals the effec-
tiveness of our online adaptation. The adaptation process gradually limits the martingale value from
growing compared to the non-adaptation case. Observe how the martingale of the adapted model
eventually converges to a plateau. This visually demonstrates the success of adapting the model to
the new distribution, making the target entropies statistically indistinguishable from the source data.

E
Algorithms

In this section, we present a series of algorithms essential to understanding and implementing our
proposed methods. It is important to note that throughout these algorithms, we do not explicitly state
each instance where lists or variables are updated; however, such updates are implicitly understood to
occur during computations.

We use the “Assume” directive in our algorithms to outline which variables are accessible as
global variables. These global variables are updated as part of the algorithms’ operations but are
not repeatedly declared within each algorithmic step. This approach is chosen to streamline the

Synthetic experiment

To evaluate the methods, we generate a synthetic dataset by generating two sets of points, each
containing 2, 500 samples. Specifically, samples for the first set (class −1) are drawn from a normal
distribution N(−1, 1), while samples for the second set (class +1) are drawn from N(1, 1). We
use these 5, 000 samples to calculate the source CDF. Note that we do not use a training set, as we
initialized the pre-trained model’s parameter ω to the optimal value, which is ω = 0.

We then create two test sets:

• In-distribution test data, which consists of 10,000 samples per class, following the source
distribution.

• Out-of-distribution test data, which consists of 10,000 samples per class, but with shifted
distributions—the class −1 samples are drawn from N(0, 1) and the class +1 samples are
drawn from N(2, 1). This represents a distributional shift of 1 unit in X.

We defined our model parameter as ω ∈R. Two types of loss functions were employed:

• Entropy loss ℓent (1), computed by evaluating the entropy of each point’s prediction given
the model parameter ω.

• Matching loss ℓmatch (2), computed using an optimal transport mapping, i.e., F −1
s
◦Ft, to
match the new set of target entropies derived from fω to the source entropies obtained from
the holdout data.

Hyperparameters and training scheme
The optimization of each method was executed over 200
steps using a fixed learning rate of 5. Although lower learning rates were also effective, a higher

learning rate was chosen to accelerate the demonstration. The optimization was performed with a
batch size of 64. Each method’s performance was evaluated at the end of this process. We clipped
entropy minimization convergence if it went outside the bounds of our plot. In all experiments
conducted in this paper, we choose the following set of hyperparameters, defined in Algorithm 1:

• D = 1.8.
• γ =
1

ImageNet-C experiments

Models
Our experiments utilize two pre-trained architectures: a Vision Transformer (ViT) with
layer normalization (LN) and a ResNet50 with group normalization (GN). Both are pre-trained models
from the timm library. We calibrate both models using temperature scaling, setting the temperature of
ResNet50 to T = 0.90 and T = 1.025 for ViT. For POEM specifically, we implement an action delay of
100 examples throughout the experiments in this paper. This delay allows the monitoring component
of POEM to accumulate sufficient evidence before updating the model parameters, mitigating the
influence of potentially noisy initial data.

Data
We randomly sample 25% of the examples from ImageNet validation set as an unlabelled
holdout set. The corresponding corrupted examples are excluded from ImageNet-C to maintain
the validity of the holdout data. All methods are evaluated only on the remaining 75% samples.
Each experiment is repeated 10 times with different holdout data splits and data selections, which
is particularly crucial for experiments with small subsets of examples, such as the continual shifts
experiments. Specifically for ViT, we modify the default preprocessing transforms offered by SAR, to
the one used by the model during its training (see https://huggingface.co/timm/vit_base_
patch16_224.augreg2_in21k_ft_in1k for the exact details). This adjustment is crucial to ensure
proper estimation of the source CDF as well as ensure the model’s performance on in-distribution
data adheres to the one reported in Hugging Face.

Code, hyperparameters, and learning scheme
We use the SAR [43] repository (available at
https://github.com/mr-eggplant/SAR) for the ImageNet and ImageNet-C experiments. To
ensure consistency with prior works, we adopt the hyperparameters, optimizers, and procedures
provided within the SAR repository. This ensures that all baseline methods as well as POEM are run
with the exact same settings. We also compare our method with COTTA[97] using the code provided
by the authors, available at https://github.com/qinenergy/cotta. In more detail:

• For all methods except COTTA:
– The learning rate (η in Algorithm 2) calculation follows these formulas:

* ViT: learning rate =
  0.001

64

× batch size

* ResNet50: learning rate =
  0.00025

64

× batch size × 2
– We use SGD optimizer with momentum of 0.9 for self-training.
– We use λ = 0.40 · log (1000) (denoted by E0 in [42, 43]).
• For COTTA:
– We tune the learning-rate search for each model (ResNet and ViT), ranging from 0.001

64 ·i
where i ∈[0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8], and select the best-performing value for each model on the
continual setting with a corruption segment size of 1, 000. This process resulted in the
following learning rate values.

* ViT learning rate =
  0.001

64

× 4

* ResNet50 learning rate =
  0.001

64

× 2
– We use Adam optimizer with β = (0.9, 0.999) and weight decay 0 for self-training, as
employed in the original work.

A batch size of 1 is consistently used throughout all of the experiments, and, as mentioned in Appendix
F, we use D = 1.8 and γ =
1
8·
√

3 ≈0.0722 for our monitoring algorithm (see Algorithm 1). Lastly,
since the empirical CDF in Algorithm 2 (line 6) is calculated from a finite set of data points, it
inherently creates a step function. In practice, we use linear interpolation to create a continuous
function for better operation.

Hardware
All experiments are conducted on our local server, equipped with 16 NVIDIA A40 GPU
- 49GB GPUs, 192 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6336Y CPUs, and 1TB of RAM memory. Each
experiment uses a single GPU and 8 CPUs.

F.2.1
Additional experiments: continual shifts

Figure 5: Continual test-time adaptation on ImageNet-C with a ResNet model. Top: Per-
corruption accuracy with a corruption segment size of 1,000 examples. Results are obtained over
10 independent trials; error bars are tiny. Bottom left: Severity shift—low (1) to high (5) and back
to low. Bottom center: Severity shift—high (5) to low (1) and back to high. Bottom right: Mean
accuracy under continual corruptions as a function of the corruption segment size.

Supplementary details for the continual shifts experiments presented in the main manuscript
For the corruption shift experiment, we used corruption segments sizes in the range of 100, 250, 500,
1000, and 2000. Apart from the bottom right panels of Figures 2 and 5, the results are obtained using
corruption segment size of 1,000 exclusively.

Experiments with a ResNet (GN) model
Herein, we repeat the same experiments from Section
4 of the main manuscript to evaluate our proposed method within a continual shift setting, but now
focus on a ResNet50 (GN) model. The results are summarized in Figure 5, showing a similar trend
to that obtained with the ViT model, albeit accuracies that are closer to the baseline methods. We
note that the baseline accuracy of ResNet is far below that of ViT. The bottom right panel of Figure 5
demonstrates POEM’s efficiency in adapting to fast-changing distributions with only a few examples.
While the advantage of POEM is less clear with small corruption segments in ResNet, it becomes
evident as early as segment size 500. Observe the bottom right panel of Figure 5. At corruption
segment size of 2,000, POEM surpasses the best baseline method’s accuracy (EATA) by 1.27%. POEM
also achieves 4.64% increase compared to the original model (no adaptation).

Additional experiments: single shift

Table 1 summarizes baseline methods’ accuracy on ImageNet-C for ViT and ResNet models. Table 2
offers a more detailed breakdown of the results in Table 1, showing accuracy for each corruption type.

F.2.3
Additional experiments: in-distribution and the behavior of ϵ

Even though adapting on unseen in-distribution data from ImageNet attains similar accuracies for all
baseline methods compared to the no-adapt approach (Table 3), POEM maintains this accuracy with
the most minimal change to the original model’s parameters ω and virtually unchanged ECE. This

is demonstrated in the left panels of Figure 3 and Figure 6. Specifically, as seen in Table 3, ∥ω∥2
F
for POEM is merely 0.17, significantly lower than other methods on ResNet50—over 30 times less
change than the closest baseline method. This minimal change demonstrates POEM’s capability for
controlled adaptation.

Figure 7 further demonstrates the “no-harm” effect of POEM under in-distribution test data. The left
panel shows the empirical CDF of the entropy values ˆFt of all baseline methods, indicating that
these lead to overconfident predictions. This is in contrast to POEM, whose estimated target CDF
closely aligns with the source distribution. Such a minimal deviation from the source distribution
aligns with our previous findings—POEM tends to keep the model parameters intact when adaptation
is unnecessary.

When applying the model to out-of-distribution data (right panel of Figure 7), the unadapted model
appears slightly under-confident, as indicated by its corresponding CDF ˆFt being lower than ˆFs.
Here, POEM effectively restores the model’s original confidence by adjusting its estimated CDF to
closely match the source CDF. SAR achieves comparable results to POEM, but through a different
strategy. It employs a restart mechanism that acts as a safeguard, activated when the entropy of the
adapted model drops below a specific exponential moving average (EMA) threshold.

F.2.4
Ablation study

We assess the impact of ℓmatch++ (10) compared to ℓmatch (2) on adaptation accuracy through isolated
analysis. Table 4 shows that our basic match loss ℓmatch improves the test accuracy over the no-adapt
baseline, even without filtering and weighting. This underscores the core strength of our approach.
The enhanced ℓmatch++ that incorporates sample filtering and weighting mechanisms further boosts
performance.

Methods, code, hyperparameters, and learning scheme
The pre-trained ResNet32 architecture
includes batch normalization (BN) layers, which forces us to use a batch-size of 4 during self-training.
This differs from the batch-size we used in the ImageNet experiments, which was equal to 1. In what
follows, we compare POEM to SAR, EATA, and TENT only. We do not conduct experiments with COTTA,
as our ImageNet experiments showed that COTTA performs inferiorly when the self-training batch
size is small. To ensure fair comparison, we perform a grid search for choosing the optimal learning

Continual shifts experiments

Short-term adaptation performance
We focus on the continual setting where the corruption type
is changing over time, akin to our ImageNet experiments. Each corruption type includes 1, 024
samples, resulting in a test set of approximately 15 · 1, 024 ≈15, 000 samples. The results are
summarized in Figure 8. Following that figure, one can see that our method is competitive and even

outperforms baseline methods in terms of accuracy. Runtime comparisons (relative to the no-adapt
model) are also presented, demonstrating that our method’s complexity is similar to TENT and EATA,
and lower than SAR. Additionally, the sensitivity study for the learning rate parameter η reveals our
method’s robustness to this hyperparameter, particularly when compared to SAR and TENT.

Long-term adaptation performance
Here, we conduct a similar experiment, but on a larger test
set containing 112,500 corrupted samples (15 versions of 7,500 images). The results, summarized
in Figure 9, show that our proposed method is competitive with the baseline methods in terms of
adaptation accuracy. Notably, our method’s runtime is twice as fast as SAR and comparable to EATA
and TENT. Unlike SAR, we do not employ a model-reset mechanism, nor do we use an anti-forgetting
loss like EATA—yet our approach demonstrates robustness over the long term. In contrast, the right
panel of Figure 9 reveals that TENT is highly sensitive to the choice of learning rate.

Office-Home experiments

Data
The OfficeHome dataset consists of images from 4 domains: “Art”, “Clipart”, “Product”, and
“Real World”. It contains a total of 15,588 images across 65 object categories. The “Art” domain has
2,427 images, “Clipart” has 4,365 images, “Product” has 4,439 images, and “Real World” has 4,357
images. We focus on adaptation from the “Real World” domain to the “Art”, “Clipart”, and “Product”
domains. We chose this setup over a continual setting as it is deemed more natural for this dataset.
Given the lack of a predefined data structure, we split the dataset into an 80% training set from the
“Real World” samples, with the remainder serving as validation and holdout sets for our method and
EATA.

Methods, model, hyperparameters, and learning scheme
We fine-tune the last layer of the
ResNet50 with Group Normalization (GN) previously used in the ImageNet experiments. We fit the
model on 80% of the “Real World” examples for 25 epochs, with the best model saved based on
performance on the remaining 20%. We use Adam optimizer with default PyTorch hyperparameters
and set the learning rate to 5 · 10−5. Similar to the CIFAR experiments, we compare POEM to SAR,
EATA, and TENT only; our ImageNet experiments showed that COTTA performs inferiorly when the
self-training batch size is 1, which is used in this experiment as well. Learning rates are tuned for
each method using a predefined grid, ensuring a fair comparison, similar to our CIFAR experiments.
The hyperparameters of POEM’s monitoring tool are as specified in Section F.

accuracy across all three target domains. The results in the left panel are obtained using the best
learning rate for each method.

F.4.1
Single domain adaptation experiments

Test-time adaptation is applied to the entire test data of each target domain (”Art”, ”Clipart” and
”Product”). Results are summarized in Figure 10. Overall, all the methods demonstrate modest
accuracy gains compared to the ‘no-adapt’ case. Our proposed method POEM slightly outperforms
TENT and EATA in terms of accuracy, while achieving results comparable to SAR. In terms of compu-
tational efficiency, our method’s runtime is on par with TENT and EATA, and notably faster than SAR.
Regarding sensitivity to the choice of the learning rate, our approach displays superior robustness
compared to TENT and SAR, and a similar robustness to that of EATA.

Future Directions

In future work, we plan to complement our empirical findings with a theoretical analysis. Our
goal is to rigorously determine when entropy matching is superior to entropy minimization, thereby
uncovering the theoretical benefits and limitations of our approach.

Another future direction is to support POEM with the ability to handle label shift at test time. This
challenge is exemplified by scenarios where the source domain has a balanced label distribution, but
the test domain becomes unbalanced. In such cases, our current monitoring tool might detect this label
shift and trigger unnecessary adaptation in the absence of covariate shift. This underscores the need
for a monitoring tool that remains invariant to label shifts. To address this challenge, one may consider
two potential approaches. The first builds on ideas from [113], particularly their prediction-balanced
reservoir sampling technique. This method can be used to approximately simulate an i.i.d. data stream
from a non-i.i.d. stream in a class-balanced manner, potentially reducing our martingale process’s
sensitivity to label shifts. The second approach may involve the use of a weighted source CDF instead
of the standard source CDF, with weights corresponding to the likelihood ratio P t(Y )/P s(Y ). This
concept, borrowed from conformal prediction literature [114], aims to make the test loss to “look
exchangeable” with the source losses, thus adjusting for label shift. The main challenge here lies in
reasonably approximating the likelihood ratio P t(Y )/P s(Y ), especially when facing simultaneous
covariate and label shifts at test time. The ideas presented in [115] may offer a promising starting
point for exploring this avenue.
