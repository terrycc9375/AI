Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet
they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose Additional Logic
Training (ALT), which aims to enhance LLMs’ reasoning capabilities by program-
generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing
high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical
insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named
Formal Logic Deduction Diverse (FLD×2), comprising numerous samples of
multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic
expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on
FLD×2 substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs,
including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on
logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks,
and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.

Introduction

Knowledge and reasoning have long been considered essential elements for achieving artificial
intelligence (McCarthy, 1959; Weizenbaum, 1966; Winograd, 1971; Colmerauer and Roussel, 1973;
Shortliffe, 1976; Elkan and Greiner, 1993). Knowledge refers to facts about the world, e.g., “objects
with mass generate a gravitational field” and “the Earth has mass.” Reasoning involves combining
multiple facts according to specific rules to obtain new knowledge. For example, the new knowledge
that “the Earth generates a gravitational field” can be derived from the aforementioned two facts.

Recent observations suggest that LLMs can solve problems using memorized knowledge of similar
samples seen during pre-training, but they cannot solve novel, unknown problems that require
reasoning (Hodel and West, 2023; Dasgupta et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). For instance, LLMs
can solve famous arithmetic problems as is but not when the numbers are changed (Razeghi et al.,
2022), and they can solve coding tests from past years before the “knowledge cutoff” but not from the
present year (Mitchell, 2023). This bias towards knowledge has been observed even in state-of-the-art
LLMs such as GPT-4 (Liu et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023; Dziri et al., 2023).

LLMs’ poor reasoning capabilities can stem from the lack of high-quality reasoning samples in the
pre-training corpus, which primarily consists of human-written texts (Betz et al., 2021; Morishita
et al., 2023). Indeed, reasoning samples in human-written texts often exhibit low quality, as evidenced
by fallacies and biases commonly found in online debates (Hansson, 2004; Guia¸su and Tindale,
2018; Cheng et al., 2017). This is unsurprising given that humans usually think reflexively rather
than through rigid reasoning (Kahneman, 2011; Sunstein and Hastie, 2015; Paglieri, 2017). Thus, a

Figure 1: The performance gains to LLaMA-3.1-70B by Additional Logic Training (ALT) on the
proposed synthetic corpus, FLD×2 (Formal Logic Deduction Diverse). Each benchmark set, such as
“Logic” and “Math”, comprises various benchmarks in that domain. Tables 2, 4 shows the details.

straightforward strategy to improve LLMs’ reasoning capabilities is to prepare many high-quality
reasoning samples and train LLMs on them.

We propose one such approach, Additional Logic Training (ALT), which utilizes high-quality
samples of logical reasoning, the most fundamental form of reasoning. To prepare such samples, we
utilize synthetic generation (Clark et al., 2021; Betz et al., 2021; Tafjord et al., 2021; Morishita et al.,
2023), where computer programs generate deductive reasoning samples in which a given hypothesis
is proven or disproven by combining given facts following rigid reasoning rules. We overview ALT
in Figure 2.

In synthetic generation, computer programs generate samples according to pre-designed patterns, so
this design largely determines the quality of these samples by nature. Thus, we start by discussing
what is the ideal design for synthetic logic samples, incorporating symbolic logic theory and
empirical findings (Section 2). The essence of logical reasoning lies in its ability to handle unknown
facts, unlike knowledge, which deals solely with established facts, such as commonsense facts;
therefore, samples must cover reasoning with unknown facts. Samples must include both illogical
and logical reasoning to enable LLMs to distinguish between them. The samples must cover various
patterns regarding a comprehensive set of reasoning aspects, such as reasoning rules and linguistic
expressions of logical statements. We summarize these discussions into design principles, which
guide the design of synthetic logic samples. Finally, based on these principles, we construct a
synthetic corpus named Formal Logic Deduction Diverse (FLD×2), comprising numerous samples
of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions,
and challenging distractors (Section 3).

We then empirically verify that ALT can enhance LLMs’ reasoning capabilities (Sections 4, 5).
Using 31 benchmarks covering diverse tasks, we observed that ALT on FLD×2 substantially boosts
state-of-the-art LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. Even LLaMA-3.1-70B, the largest LLM pre-trained
on over 15 trillion tokens, shows substantial improvements with ALT (Figure 1). Among synthetic
logic corpora with different sample designs, FLD×2 yielded the largest performance gains, validating
our proposed design principles. Moreover, we discovered that employing a knowledge-forgetting
prevention method during ALT is critically important, as it likely prevents the LLM’s knowledge of
established facts from being displaced by the unknown facts included in synthetic logic corpora.

Finally, we analyze which task-solving capabilities ALT can enhance and why (Section 6). We ob-
served a substantial improvement of up to 30 points on logical reasoning tasks (Table 4a). Surprisingly,
we also observed improvements in abductive reasoning tasks, which go beyond the synthetic logic
corpora’s original deductive reasoning tasks. Case analyses indicate that these improvements result
from LLMs having acquired the fundamentals of the logic reflected in the design principles. We also
observed improvements of up to 10 points on math and coding tasks, indicating the generalizability of
the obtained reasoning capabilities (Tables 4b, 4c). We also observed improvements of up to 6 points
on natural language inference (NLI) tasks (Table 4d). Case analyses suggest that LLMs successfully
integrated the commonsense knowledge they had originally acquired during pre-training with the
logical reasoning capabilities newly acquired from ALT. Improvements across various other tasks
(Table 4e) demonstrate the broad benefits of the obtained reasoning capabilities beyond standard
reasoning tasks, though the modest improvements of up to 2 points indicate the need for future
research on more effective application of these capabilities.

Figure 2: Our proposed Additional Logic Training (ALT) aims to enhance LLMs’ reasoning capa-
bilities through training on many synthetically generated logical reasoning samples. Our sample
generator (left) first generates a sample of multi-step deductive reasoning and then converts it into
a deduction sample written in English (right). LLMs must generate logical steps to derive a given
hypothesis from provided facts. The sample generator adheres to theoretically and empirically
grounded design principles discussed in Section 2. Refer to Figure D.3 for a real sample.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose Additional Logic Training (ALT) and empirically verify that it can enhance the
reasoning capability of state-of-the-art LLMs across various sizes, from 7B to 70B.

• We establish systematic design principles for synthetic logic samples; then, we construct a
synthetic corpus named Formal Logic Deduction Diverse (FLD×2), comprising numerous
samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic
expressions, and challenging distractors. We empirically verify that Formal Logic Deduction
Diverseindeed leads to the largest improvements among corpora with different sample designs.

• We demonstrate that LLMs enhanced by ALT can solve not only the original logical reasoning
tasks present in synthetic logic corpora but also other tasks, such as math and coding tasks, and
notably NLI tasks, which require integrating knowledge and reasoning. This finding underscores
the potential for advancing truly versatile AI possessing both knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
We release the corpus, code, and the trained model under a permissive license 1.

How Should Synthetic Logic Samples Be Designed?

In synthetic generation, computer programs generate samples according to pre-designed patterns,
so this design largely determines the quality of the samples. While Previous studies have examined
several designs (Clark et al., 2021; Betz et al., 2021; Tafjord et al., 2021; Morishita et al., 2023), these
designs were not systematically discussed, so they may not be the most effective ones.

Thus, we start by discussing how to optimally design synthetic logic samples. To this end, we consider
symbolic logic theory as suggested by Morishita et al. (2023) and integrate empirical findings from
previous studies. First, we observe that the essence of logical reasoning, based solely on the logical
relationships between facts, lies in its ability to handle unknown facts, unlike knowledge, which by
definition deals solely with established facts (Section 2.1). Therefore, we argue that samples should
cover reasoning with unknown facts to represent this essential aspect of logical reasoning. We also
observe that logical reasoning involves various other aspects, such as illogical reasoning, reasoning
rules, and linguistic expressions that represent logical statements (sections 2.2 to 2.4). The samples
should cover various patterns regarding these aspects to enable LLMs to solve various reasoning
problems. We summarize these discussions into the following design principles, which guide the
design of synthetic logic samples.

2.1
Teaching Reasoning with Unknown Facts

We first explore the essence of logical reasoning that differentiates itself from knowledge. Consider
the following logical step:

The Earth orbits the Sun.
If the Earth orbits the sun, the Earth has four seasons.
The Earth has four seasons.
(1)

This step is valid because the conclusion is logically derived from the two premises. Next, consider
another logical step:

The Earth orbits the Sun.
If the Earth orbits the sun, the Earth does not have four seasons.
The Earth does not have four seasons.
(2)

The second premise and consequently, the conclusion, is factually wrong. Nevertheless, if the premise
was hypothetically correct, the conclusion could be logically derived. Therefore, step (2) is also
logically valid. Finally:

1. A Foo star exists.
2. If a Foo star exists, a Bar star also exists.
A Bar star exists.
(3)

“Foo star” and “Bar star” are unknowns; nonetheless, we can still determine that step (3) is logically
valid. Steps (1) to (3) above can be abstracted into a deduction rule, i.e., modus ponens, using
symbols:
F
F →G
modus ponens
G
(4)

As we have seen, the logical validity of a deduction rule depends solely on whether the conclusion
is logically derived from the premises, not on the factual correctness of the contents of F and G.
Therefore, the contents of F and G can be arbitrary.

Now, we consider what kind of samples would be needed to teach the deduction rule (4) to LLMs.
We assume a task to generate the conclusion given the premises as prompt inputs. If the learner were
human, they would be able to infer the underlying deduction rule (4) by observing samples such as
(1) to (2). As a result, they would become able to solve the unknown problem (3).

However, from a purely inductive perspective, samples (1) to (2) cannot simply be generalized to the
deduction rule (4). This is because the samples (1) to (2) themselves do not contain the information
that the contents of F and G are arbitrary. In fact, one could generalize samples (1) to (2) to other
rules; for example, the conclusion G can be derived if F and F →G are given as premises and F
and G include ’Earth’ as their contents. Innumerable such deduction rules can be inductively inferred
from the given samples. In other words, induction has arbitrariness (Hume, 1748; Goodman, 1954;
Quine, 1969).

Humans prefer simpler rules (Bertrand; Wittgenstein, 1922), so they boldly induce up to the deduction
rule (4). However, it is unclear how purely inductive learners such as LLMs, which extract only what
can be inferred from samples without prior preferences, induce up to (4). For example, if only specific
contents such as “Alice is kind” and “Bob is smart” are assigned to F and G in training samples, an
LLM could develop into a machine that generates the conclusion G only when the input contains the
specific contents. In order for LLMs to accurately induce that F and G are indeed arbitrary:

Design Principle 1 (Reasoning with Unknown Facts). Prepare many samples assigning arbitrary
contents to F and G. They will make LLMs accurately induce F and G are indeed arbitrary, ultimately
enabling them to reason with unknown facts.

2.2
Teaching Illogical Reasoning
Suppose we have LLMs trained on a large number of samples as follows:

F ∧G
(F ∧G) →H
H
(5)

where ∧denotes logical conjunction, and arbitrary contents are assigned to F, G, H. Suppose that
we give this LLM a problem such as:

F
(F ∧G) →H

??
(6)

Since the premises are insufficient for logically deducting the conclusion, outputting nothing is the
correct answer.

4


---Page Break---
Unfortunately, an LLM could output H, which was indeed often observed in our preliminary experi-
ments. This is because while the LLMs can induce from sample (5) that it can generate the conclusion
H when the two premises of (5) are given, the LLMs cannot induce from the sample that it is not
allowed to generate the conclusion H when the premises of (6) are given, as such information is not
included in the sample (5) itself. Therefore,

Design Principle 2 (Illogical Reasoning). Include negative samples such as (6). These samples will
make LLMs induce that conclusions cannot be derived from insufficient premises.

2.3
Teaching Diverse Reasoning Rules
Deduction rules other than (4) exist:

(F∧G)

F
(F∧G) ∧elimination
G
(F →G)∧(G →H) syllogism

F→H
F→G
contraposition
¬G→¬F
¬(F∨G)

¬F∧¬G
¬(F∧G)
De Morgan’s laws
¬F∨¬G
(7)

where ∨denotes logical disjunction and ¬ negation. Since there are infinitely many possible logical
formulas that can appear as premises and conclusions, there are infinitely many deduction rules.
Providing LLMs with these infinite deduction rules is obviously intractable.

Instead of directly providing these infinite deduction rules, we can take another approach. Consider
multi-step deductive reasoning (Figure 2 left), where multiple deduction rules derive a conclusion.
Notice that the syllogism in (7) can be expressed by multi-step deductive reasoning using more
“atomic” deduction rules. Indeed, there exists a set of atomic deduction rules called the axioms that
satisfies the following:
Theorem 2.1 (Completeness of First-Order Predicate Logic Gödel (1930)). Any valid deduction rule
can be expressed by multistep deductive reasoning constructed from the axioms.

In contrast to the axioms, the ‘compound’ deduction rules, such as syllogism, contraposition, and
De Morgan’s laws, are called theorems. According to the completeness Theorem 2.1, if we can
handle the axioms, we can effectively handle other deduction rules as well. Indeed, Morishita et al.
(2023) empirically verified that a language model trained on the axioms generalizes to handle other
deduction rules more effectively than those trained on non-axiom deduction rules. Therefore,

Design Principle 3 (Diverse Reasoning Rules). Samples should express multi-step deduction con-
structed from the axioms. They will effectively teach LLMs diverse deduction rules (Morishita et al.,
2023)

In multi-step deductive reasoning, the number of logical steps s from premises to a conclusion can
vary largely depending on the problem. Therefore:

Design Principle 3’ (Diverse Reasoning Rules). Samples should include diverse numbers of logical
steps s.

Ideally, this would be sufficient, but empirical evidence has shown that LLMs struggle with construct-
ing multi-step deductive reasoning with large steps s (Gontier et al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2023).
Consequently, LLMs would not excel at handling theorems that require a large number of steps s
when expressed by the axioms. Therefore, as an additional countermeasure:

Design Principle 3” (Diverse Reasoning Rules). Samples should also include representative theorems,
such as syllogism, contraposition, and De Morgan’s laws.

2.4
Teaching Diverse Linguistic Expressions that Represent Logical Statements

There are various linguistic structures for expressing the logical relationship F →G, such as “If F
then G”, “F leads to G”, and “F results in G”. If we only include specific expressions in the corpora,
LLMs may only learn to react to these specific expressions, which has been observed in previous
experiments (Zhang et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023). To prevent this,

Design Principle 4 (Diverse Linguistic Expressions). Samples should include diverse linguistic
expressions that represent logical statements.

In this chapter, we have established the principles to guide the design of synthetic logic samples.
Next, we construct a synthetic logic corpus based on these principles.

Creating a Synthetic Corpus based on Design Principles
To prepare diverse samples reflecting the design principles 1 to 4 (DP1-4), we built a novel sample
generator by extending the previous one by Morishita et al. (2023) and then generated the synthetic
logic corpus named FLD×2 (Formal Logic Deduction Diverse). Figure 2 shows a schematic of our
generator and a deduction sample. Table 1 compares FLD×2 with existing corpora. Figure D.3
provides an actual deduction sample included in FLD×2.

More specifically, our generator generates deduction samples through the following steps. First, the
generator randomly generates a sample of multi-step deductive reasoning written in logical formulas,
as shown on the left side of Figure 2, where a conclusion is derived from premises using multiple
deduction rules (See Appendix D.3 for more details of this generation procedure). At this time, the
generator also generates ‘distractor’ logical formulas, which express negative premises of DP2. Next,
the generator converts each logical formula into English expressions. To achieve this, the generator
first randomly selects a template from pre-defined options, such as “If F, then G,” “F leads to G,”
or “F results in G,” for the logical formula “F →G.” It then assigns English content randomly
constructed from a vocabulary, such as “(that) a Foo star exists” and “(that) a Bar star exists,” to
each symbol, such as F and G. Finally, it converts the multi-step deduction into a deduction sample
(right side of Figure 2) by using the premises as ‘facts’, the conclusion as ‘hypothesis’, and the
intermediate logical steps as ‘logical steps’. The deduction sample requires LLMs to generate logical
steps that derive a given hypothesis based on the given facts.

Table 1 outlines the comparison of FLD×2 with other existing corpora (Clark et al., 2021; Bao et al.,
2022; Morishita et al., 2023) in terms of DP1-4, which is detailed as follows:

• DP1: We assign F and G content randomly constructed from a vocabulary. While the existing
corpora used small-sized vocabulary of up to 15k, we use a large vocabulary of around 100k words
built from WordNet (Miller, 1995). This will teach LLMs that F and G are truly arbitrary, ultimately
enabling them to reason with unknown facts.
• DP2: The existing corpora used randomly generated logical formulas as distractors. In contrast,
we implement adversarial distractors. For example, for a premise F ∧G, we use F with missing
information (see Equations (5), (6)), and for a premise F →H, we use F ∧G →H with missing
information as distractors. These distractors teach LLMs precisely when a conclusion can and
cannot be derived. As with previous corpora, we include a variable number of distractors in each
sample, randomly chosen from a range of 0 to 20.
• DP3-3”: While the existing corpora used a small number of deduction rules of up to 13 (refer to
Figure B.4 of Morishita et al. (2023)), we include diverse deduction rules, encompassing the axioms
and representative theorems, such as modus ponens, syllogisms, and contraposition, totaling about
50 rules. We include samples with up to s = 8 logical steps, following (Morishita et al., 2023).
• DP4: We manually craft several more English templates per logical formulas than those used
in FLD. Since the templates have a nested structure, they yield combinatorially more diverse
English expressions. While counting the exact number of the resulting expressions is intractable,
we observed at least dozens of expressions per logical formula, including minor variations. See
Appendix D.4 for details.

Experimental Setup

We briefly explain the experimental settings. Refer to Appendix E for the details.
Synthetic Logic Corpora: We examine the proposed FLD×2 and previous corpora (Table 1).

LLMs: We used the state-of-the-art LLM, LLaMA-3.1 (8B and 70B) (AI@Meta, 2024).

Training Settings: We trained the LLMs by a method similar to supervised fine-tuning; as illustrated
in Figure 2, we used the facts and hypothesis as inputs and logical steps and additional answer label
(see Appendix D.1) as outputs. We excluded loss computation for the inputs to prevent LLMs from
learning to generate unknown facts. We trained the LLMs for 1 epoch on 100k samples (∼0.1B
tokens) from the training split of each corpus, with a batch size of 256, resulting in 390 steps, with a
linear warmup for 200 steps. We used the learning rate of 2e-05 for the 8B model and 3e-06 for the
70B model. We used Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2020) for implementation.

Prevention of Knowledge Forgetting by Recall Adam Optimizer: Synthetic logic corpora include
many samples with unknown facts, so training on them should cause LLMs to forget their knowledge
of existing facts. To prevent this, we employed the Recall Adam optimizer (Chen et al., 2020),
which regularizes parameter updates to avoid deviating too far from the pre-training parameters.
Recall Adam stands out for LLM training for several reasons (see Appendix E.0.1 for details).
We used our re-implemented version 2. The hyperparameters were: β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ϵ =
10−6, fisher coefficient = 4000 for the 8B model and 2000 for the 70B model.

Benchmarks: We evaluated the trained LLMs on 31 benchmarks shown in Table E.7 using 5-shot
in-context learning, except for BBH and AbuductionRules, which used 3-shot in-context learning.
These benchmarks cover a wide range of tasks and are prominent in LLM evaluation. Note that we
excluded the synthetic logic corpora used for training, as training on them often leads to overfitting
to their superficial and statistical cues (Zhang et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023), failing to measure
truly generalizable reasoning capabilities. We used lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2023) and
bigcode-evaluation-harness (Ben Allal et al., 2022) for the implementation.

Can Additional Logic Training Enhance LLMs’ Capabilities?

Table 2 show the performance of LLMs before and after ALT. Most LLMs trained with ALT
outperformed their counterparts without ALT. Notably, ALT yielded substantial gains of up to 10
points even for LLaMA-3.1-70B, the largest LLM pre-trained on over 15 trillion tokens. These results
verify that ALT can enhance the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.

Among the LLMs trained with ALT, the one trained on FLD×2 (i.e., ⊕ALT-FLD×2) achieved the
highest generalization performance across the benchmarks. Table 3 shows the performance of the
LLMs trained on ablated FLD×2 corpora, each of which lacks one of the design principles. As
seen, ablating any design principle almost always led to performance degradation. These results
demonstrate that the proposed design principles are critical to obtaining the maximum possible gain
from ALT, and each principle is indispensable.

Table F.8 shows that the LLMs trained with ALT without preventing knowledge forgetting by Recall
Adam optimizer underperformed compared to their counterparts trained with knowledge forgetting
prevention and even the LLM without ALT. This behavior presumably occurred because the unknown
facts included in synthetic logic corpora displaced the LLM’s knowledge of existing facts. Therefore,
knowledge-forgetting prevention is critically important for the success of ALT.

6
What Capabilities Can Additional Logic Training Enhance and Why?

We analyze the results on each benchmark or each case and discuss whether and why the LLM’s
capabilities to solve the tasks can or cannot be enhanced by ALT.

6.1
Logical Reasoning Tasks

Table 4a shows that ALT substantially boosted LLaMA-3.1-70B’s performance by up to 30 points
on various benchmarks dealing with logical reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, we also observed im-
provements on abductive reasoning tasks, which go beyond the original deductive reasoning tasks

in synthetic logic corpora. Abductive reasoning involves guessing the missing premises that caused
the observed conclusion rather than deriving a conclusion from the premises. For example, from
the observed conclusion, “the window glass at home was broken and the room was ransacked,” we
guess the premise “a burglar broke in.” The improvements would be due to the fact that, while the
surface form of abductive reasoning problems differs from that of deductive reasoning, they share the
fundamentals of logic reflected in the design principles.

Next, we conduct case analyses to see whether the LLM enhanced by ALT acquired the abilities
intended by the proposed design principles (DP1-4). Table 5 shows problems where LLaMA-3.1-
70B’s errors have been corrected by ALT. The first problem is very simple, so it is surprising that
LLaMA-3.1-70B failed to solve it, indicating the inherent difficulty of learning logical reasoning
solely from pre-training. In contrast, ⊕ALT-FLD×2, which was additionally trained on FLD×2,
solved the problem correctly. The premises of the problem are randomly constructed to express
unknown facts. Therefore, the result suggests that ⊕ALT-FLD×2 acquired genuine logical reasoning
ability, which can handle unknown facts (DP1).

In the second problem, ⊕ALT-FLD×2 correctly answered “neutral”, indicating that it successfully
learned that conclusions cannot be derived from insufficient facts (DP2).

The third problem comes from the FOLIO benchmark. To solve this problem, LLMs must use
syllogism at the first step as follows: “All eels are fish, and no fish are plants. Therefore, all ells are
not plants.” ⊕ALT-FLD×2 answered this problem correctly, suggesting that it successfully learned
diverse deduction rules (DP3).

FOLIO problems are created based on Wikipedia topics, describing them in more natural and realistic
linguistic expressions than in other benchmarks. As seen in the fourth problem, ⊕ALT-FLD×2
understands such expressions, suggesting the effect of diverse expressions from DP4 and/or that
LLMs can integrate their original linguistic ability with the newly acquired logical reasoning ability.

6.2
Math and Coding Tasks

Tables 4b, 4c shows that ALT substantially boosted the LLaMA-3.1-70B’s performance by up to 7
and 10 points on math and coding tasks, respectively. The math improvements are reasonable, as
understanding predicate logic is a prerequisite for solving mathematical problems. For coding, some
recent studies have verified the opposite direction, namely, that training on coding data improves
logical reasoning abilities (Jiang et al., 2024b; MA et al., 2024; Uchiyama et al., 2024).

6.3
NLI Tasks

Table 4d shows that ALT substantially boosted the LLaMA-3.1-70B’s performance by up to 6 points
on various natural language inference (NLI) benchmarks. NLI is similar to deductive reasoning in
assessing whether a premise supports or contradicts a hypothesis. However, the main difference is
that this judgment requires a rich set of commonsense knowledge beyond the given premise.

Consider the fifth problem in Table 5: by supplementing the given fact “An Indian woman is dancing
with her partner” with the commonsense knowledge “If someone is dancing, then he/she is moving.”,
we can derive the hypothesis “A woman is moving.” The sixth problem is more challenging as we
have to trace multiple logical steps while supplementing with sufficient commonsense knowledge as
follows: “a church choir sings at a church,” “baseball is often played at a baseball field,” “a person
cannot be in two or more places at the same time,” “therefore, a church choir cannot sing for baseball.”

Since synthetic logic corpora only contain unknown facts, LLMs cannot acquire new knowledge
from them. Therefore, the commonsense knowledge used to solve the above problems must have
been acquired by the LLMs from pre-training. This suggests that LLMs can integrate their original
knowledge with the logical reasoning capabilities newly acquired from ALT to solve problems.

6.4
Other Tasks
Improvements across various other tasks (Table 4e) demonstrate the broad benefits of the obtained
reasoning capabilities beyond standard reasoning tasks; though the improvements were modest at up
to 2 percentage points, which may be due to the following reasons. First, these benchmarks include
problems that purely test knowledge, such as the first one in Table 6. Since ALT does not aim to
provide new knowledge, the ability to solve such problems does not improve by nature. Next, some
problems may require knowledge that is too advanced for LLMs, so potential improvements by the
enhanced reasoning capabilities may be bottlenecked. For example, the second problem does involve
reasoning but requires sufficient quantum mechanics knowledge as a prerequisite. However, these
knowledge-related issues should be solved by improving the quantity and quality of pre-training.

Finally, LLMs may not be able to fully utilize the potential of enhanced reasoning capabilities for
problems that require complex procedures. To solve the third problem, LLMs first must attempt
reasoning related to each choice as follows: “To build homes in an aquatic environment, one needs to
maintain body heat and insulation despite being frequently submerged in cold water. Therefore, the
waterproof fur of (A) is essential”, and “To build . . . , one must gather and process natural materials
like wood. Large, sharp teeth of (C) are critical as they allow beavers to cut down trees and shape
branches.” Next, while reasoning traces on (A) to (D) all seem reasonable, LLMs must choose the
single best answer, considering the subtle nuance of the question context, as follows: “Since the
question emphasizes the aquatic environment, the least related reasoning trace should be (C).” This
complex procedure contrasts with logical reasoning and NLI problems, where LLMs can directly
obtain an answer from a single reasoning trace. Previous studies also observed that such procedure on
multiple-choice QA problems are challenging for LLMs (Robinson and Wingate, 2023; Zheng et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2024a). Since ALT alone does not teach LLMs such task-specific procedures,
additional training on these procedures should be necessary to solve these problems.

Conclusion
Towards versatile artificial intelligence with reasoning capabilities, we proposed Additional Logic
Training on synthetic logic samples. We established systematic design principles well-grounded on
symbolic logic theory and previous empirical findings. We constructed a corpus named Formal Logic
Deduction Diverse (FLD×2) based on the design principles. We empirically showed that ALT on
FLD×2 substantially enhances the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.

A.1
Investigation of Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs

Many studies examine LLMs’ reasoning capabilities (Askell, 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Razeghi et al.,
2022; Liu et al., 2023b; Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Hodel and West,
2023; Dziri et al., 2023; Dasgupta et al., 2023). Patel et al. (2024) observed LLMs’ performance
significantly declines as reasoning steps increase in multi-step logical reasoning tasks. Dougrez-
Lewis et al. (2024) revealed ChatGPT struggles with abductive reasoning when verifying claims by
decomposing their evidence into atomic reasoning steps. Wang et al. (2024b) found that GPT-series
models showed significant gaps compared to humans in dealing with inference rules. Parmar et al.
(2024) introduced LogicBench and showed that existing LLMs struggle with instances involving
complex reasoning and negations. Wan et al. (2024) introduced LogicAsker, which assesses whether
LLMs can employ a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic and
found significant gaps in LLMs’ learning of logical rules. Bhuiya et al. (2024) proposed a challenging
multi-hop reasoning benchmark with seemingly plausible but incorrect multi-hop reasoning chains
and found that state-of-the-art LLMs’ capabilities to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected by such
chains. Mondorf and Plank (2024) introduced TruthQuest, which assesses LLMs’ capabilities to
conduct suppositional reasoning, i.e., reasoning where each statement can be false, and found that
LLMs exhibit significant difficulties solving these tasks. Sprague et al. (2024) introduced a complex
multi-step reasoning benchmark, MuSR, and characterized the gaps that remain for techniques like
chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.

Biases and Errors
Ando et al. (2023); Ozeki et al. (2024); Bertolazzi et al. (2024); Eisape et al.
(2024) found that LLMs exhibit human-like reasoning biases in syllogistic arguments. Jiang et al.
(2024a) found that LLMs exibit “token-biases” in solving logical reasoning problems. Aoki et al.
(2024) revealed that LMs rely heavily on heuristics, such as lexical overlap, in the earlier stages of
reasoning. Zhao et al. (2024a) constructed a MATHTRAP with carefully designed logical traps into
the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8k and found that while LLMs possess the knowledge
required to solve these traps, they do not spontaneously use such knowledge them to handle the
problems. Han et al. (2024) found that LLMs exhibit A-Not-B errors similar to human infants, failing
to suppress the previously established response pattern during ICL. Liu et al. (2024) found that LLMs
often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or
commonsense. Zhou et al. (2024b) found that subtle alterations in the surface form can significantly
impact the answer distribution, suggesting that LLMs solve reasoning problems using surface cues.
Chen et al. (2024) found that the reasoning performance of LLMs is affected by the order of the
premises. Hong et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024) found that LLMs struggle to identify fallacious
reasoning steps accurately, suggesting challenges in self-verification methods.

Reasoning in Unknown Situation
Zhao et al. (2024b) found that LLMs struggle with reasoning in
uncommon situations. Zhu et al. (2024) introduced a framework to dynamically generate reasoning
samples, and LLMs perform worse in those samples. Hu et al. (2024) found that while LLMs can
conduct reasoning when relevant knowledge is given in context, they are not proficient at reasoning
with knowledge embedded in the training data.

A.2
Synthetic Logic Corpus for Training LLMs

Later studies (Saha et al., 2020; Dalvi et al., 2021; Tafjord et al., 2021; Sanyal et al., 2022b) showed
that T5 can generate even the intermediate logical steps as well as the final answer.

PARARULE-Plus (Bao et al., 2022) is the enhanced version of PARARULE (Clark et al., 2021), a
variation of RuleTaker, that includes more samples and more logical steps. RoBERTa (Liu et al.,
2019) trained on PARARULE-Plus outperformed the models trained on RuleTaker.

Artificial Argument Corpus (Betz et al., 2021) includes single-step deductive reasoning samples
constructed from hand-selected deduction rules useful for critical thinking. They showed that the
GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) trained on this corpus can generalize to solve NLI tasks. However, at
the same time, they found that the LM does not generalize well to solve more challenging reasoning
tasks such as ARC (Habernal et al., 2018) and LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020).

FLD by Morishita et al. (2023, 2024) is the first synthetic logic corpus based on formal logic theory.
It includes multistep deductive reasoning samples constructed from the axioms of first-order predicate
logic, which can express any deduction rule due to the completeness theorem. Due to this nature, T5
trained on FLD generalizes most effectively to other synthetic logic corpora, compared to models
trained on other corpora.

Gontier et al. (2020) investigated the deductive reasoning capabilities of LMs on a corpus composed
of a specific type of multistep inference, kinship relationships on synthetic kinship graphs. They
found that LMs can solve this task when there are relatively few proof steps, but it is difficult for
them to generalize to solve proof steps longer than those shown in training data. Bostrom et al. (2021)
studied how to create realistic natural language expressions that represent deduction rules. To this
end, they scraped sentences from Wikipedia using a template-based method and paraphrased them.
They showed that training on this corpus helps solve real-world deductive reasoning problems such
as EntailmentBank (Dalvi et al., 2021). Pi et al. (2022) used synthetic data from program executors,
most notably SQL programs. They verified that this data can enhance numerical reasoning, logical
reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning abilities. Trinh et al. (2024) generated 100 million geometry
problems and verified that the capability of artificial intelligence can be enhanced to to pass the bronze
medal threshold of the International Mathematics Olympiad. Saeed et al. (2021); Nafar et al. (2024)
created soft reasoning rules involving with probabilistic logic, instead of hard-logic examined by the
aformentioned studies. Sileo (2024) introduced a simpler and more general declarative framework
for synthetic generation, and verified its effectiveness. Zhou et al. (2024a) synthetically generated a
large dataset of mathematics, and gained over 12 points on GSM8k.

While these studies partly examined the effect of synthetic logic corpora, whether this approach is
promising remains an open question. It has been unexplored whether the capabilities obtained from
synthetic logic corpora generalizes to solve various tasks beyond the original tasks in these corpora.
Additionally, the effect of these corpora has only been examined for small LMs trained on small
pre-training corpora such as T5 and RoBERTa; it has been highly questionable whether they can
still benefit state-of-the-art LLMs trained on a huge pre-training corpus. Furthermore, even if their
benefits were verified, it remains unclear which design of synthetic logic samples yields the largest
benefits due to the lack of systematic discussions on sample designs and empirical verification of
these designs. We aimed to answer these questions in this paper and demonstrate the potential of
synthetic logic corpora.

A.3
Distilling Reasoning Traces from Very Large LLMs

Recent approaches (Ho et al., 2023; Magister et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022, 2023; Shridhar et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c; Ben Allal et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024)
utilize very large LLMs, such as GPT-4, to prepare synthetic reasoning datasets to train smaller
LLMs. A typical procedure is as follows: (i) prepare existing reasoning problems, (ii) prompt large
LLMs to generate reasoning traces to solve these problems using techniques such as chain-of-thought
prompting (Wei et al., 2022), and (iii) train smaller LLMs on these reasoning traces.

The distillation approach and the synthetic logic corpora approach examined in this paper have
specific advantages and disadvantages, as follows.

The advantage of the distillation approach is its immediate practical effect, as it directly teaches
LLMs solutions to various existing problems. The disadvantages could be that (i) it is non-trivial for
specific solutions to specific problems to generalize to other problems, (ii) the number of training
samples is limited to existing problems in nature, (iii) the correctness and faithfulness of the reasoning
traces are not guaranteed; indeed, some studies (Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023) suggest that
large LLMs do not always faithfully follow the “reasoning traces” they themselves generate, and (iv)
it cannot enhance the very large LLMs themselves by nature.

The advantages of synthetic logic corpus approaches are that (i) since they teach the fundamentals of
reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, they have the potential to generalize to various problems,
(ii) they can generate an unlimited number of new samples, and (iii) the correctness of the reasoning
traces is guaranteed by nature. The disadvantage of this approach is that, as it only teaches the basics
of reasoning, additional training may be needed to solve more complex real-world problems, as
suggested in Section 6.4.

21


---Page Break---
We hypothesize that integrating both approaches could be promising. That is, we first train LLMs
using ALT to make them understand the fundamentals of reasoning through high-quality samples and
then train them using more realistic reasoning traces to solve complex real-world problems.

B
Limitations

• We only used deductive reasoning samples for ALT. Future work should examine other
reasoning samples, e.g., abductive and inductive reasoning.

• We only examined the first-order predicate logic system. Future work should examine other
logic systems, such as modal and linear logic.

C
Ethics and Social Impacts

The ultimate goal of the direction of this study is to develop an AI capable of reasoning logically
step by step. If AI can make a decision one logical step at a time, it would be highly explainable and
transparent to users. Furthermore, the user would be able to trace the AI’s errors. We believe that our
study is a step towards such AI that will positively impact society.

D
Details of Formal Logic Deduction Diverse

Figure D.3 shows a real sample from FLD×2. Below, We briefly explain our sample generator. Please
refer to Morishita et al. (2023) for the details.

D.1
Answer Labels

In addition to the logical steps, the samples of FLD×2 and previous corpora include answer labels
(Figure D.3): “proved” indicating that the hypothesis can be proved by the logical steps, “disproved”
indicating that the hypothesis can be disproved, and “unknown” indicating that the given facts are
insufficient for either proving or disproving the hypothesis. For samples with “unknown” labels, the
logical steps are “None.”. FLD×2 have a uniform distribution over the labels.

D.2
Splits

FLD×2 includes 100k/5k/5k samples for train/valid/test splits.

D.3
Generation of Multistep Deduction

Our sample generator first randomly generates examples of multistep deduction by forward- and
backward random deduction, using the deduction rules specified by a user.

The forward random deduction is done as follows. The generator first chooses a deduction rule
randomly and forms the initial tree where the root node is the conclusion of the chosen deduction
rules and the child nodes are the premises of the chosen deduction rule. The generator next randomly
chooses another deduction rule that can be “jointed” to the root note of the tree. A deduction rule can
be jointed to the root node of a tree if one of the premises of that deduction rule can be identified
with the root node. Then, the generator updates the tree by jointing this chosen deduction rule. The
generator continues this step multiple times until the tree achieves the required depth.

The backward random deduction is done as follows. For each step, the generator randomly chooses a
leaf node of the tree. Then, the generator randomly chooses a deduction rule that can be jointed to
the leaf node. Here, a deduction rule can be jointed to the leaf node if the deduction rule’s conclusion
can be identified with the leaf node. Then, the generator updates the tree by jointing this chosen
deduction rule. The generator continues this step multiple times until the complexity of branches
achieves the required level.

hypothesis are given to LLMs, then the LLMs are required to generate logical steps to (dis-)prove
the hypothesis based on the facts, and an answer label (see Appendix D.2).

D.4
Linguistic Expressions

We prepared linguistic templates for each logical formula, exemplified as follows:

⟨(A ∧B) →C⟩: If ⟨(A ∧B).predicate_phrase⟩, then ⟨C.predicate_phrase⟩.

: ⟨(A ∧B).noun_pharse⟩⟨cause_synonyms⟩⟨C.noun_phrase⟩.

: (. . . )

⟨(A ∧B).predicate_phrase⟩: A ⟨occur_synonyms⟩and also B ⟨occur_synonyms⟩.

: A and also B ⟨occur_synonyms⟩.

: Both A and B ⟨occur_synonyms⟩.

: (. . . )

⟨C.predicate_phrase⟩: C ⟨occur_synonyms⟩.

: (. . . )

⟨occur_synonyms⟩: occur

: happen

: take place

: (. . . )

⟨(A ∧B).noun_pharse⟩: A and B

: A and also B

: Both A and B

: That A and B ⟨occur_synonyms⟩

: (. . . )

⟨cause_synonyms⟩: cause

: result in

: lead to

: bring about

: (. . . )

( . . . )
(D.1)

As can be seen, the templates can be nested deeply, yielding combinatorially diverse linguistic
expressions.

Expanding these templates beforehand is intractable due to the combinatorial explosion, so we expand
these templates on the fly to randomly sample a single expression at a time. Estimating the exact
number of expressions is intractable for the same reason.

We manually crafted several additional English templates per logical formula (i.e., the left-hand
sides of (D.1)) compared to those used in FLD, which yield combinatorially more diverse English

expressions. We observed that at least dozens of expressions, including minor variations, are yielded
for each formula.

E
Details of Experimental Setup

E.0.1
Prevention of Knowledge Forgetting by Recall Adam Optimizer

We employed the Recall Adam (RecAdam) optimizer (Chen et al., 2020), which regularizes parameter
updates to prevent them from being too far from the pre-training parameters. Recall Adam stands out
for LLM training as it does not require access to the pre-training corpus, which is often inaccessible
or too huge to handle, nor does it require changes to the model architecture, and it has a proven track
record of usage in language models such as BERT.

E.1
Benchmarks

Table E.7 details the benchmarks used in the experiments.

E.2
Experimental Runs

We show the average and standard deviations over five seeds.

E.3
Computational Resources

The entire experiment, including preliminary ones, took about 1 week x 128 NVIDIA H100 GPUs of
our own.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist principles carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and principles below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Claims stated in Section 1 is supported by the experimental results in Sections 5,
6.

principles:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

27


---Page Break---
Justification: Appendix B
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 4, appendix E. Further, we release all the resources, including (i) the
corpus, (ii) the trained model, and (iii) code for corpus generation, LLM training, and LLM
evaluation 3.

principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we release the code, data, and model.

principles:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission principles (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission principles (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Section 4, appendix E.

principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: As stated in Appendix E.

principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96 % CI, if the
hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Appendix E.3.

principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

30


---Page Break---
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/Ethicsprinciples?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:
principles:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Appendix C
principles:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [No]
Justification:

31


---Page Break---
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage principles or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All the corpora and benchmarks used in the experiments properly state their
licenses.
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release our corpus.
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

32


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human objects.
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: THis paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human objects.
principles:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
principles for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
