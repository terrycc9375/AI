Abstract

Constantly discovering novel concepts is crucial in evolving environments. This pa-
per explores the underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery
(C-GCD), which aims to incrementally discover new classes from unlabeled data
while maintaining the ability to recognize previously learned classes. Although
several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they have limitations that
do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more practical C-GCD setting,
which includes more new classes to be discovered over a longer period, without
storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model is initially trained on labeled
data of known classes, followed by multiple incremental stages where the model is
fed with unlabeled data containing both old and new classes. The core challenge
involves two conflicting objectives: discover new classes and prevent forgetting
old ones. We delve into the conflicts and identify that models are susceptible
to prediction bias and hardness bias. To address these issues, we introduce a
debiased learning framework, namely Happy, characterized by Hardness-aware
prototype sampling and soft entropy regularization. For the prediction bias, we first
introduce clustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition,
we propose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new
classes, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new classes.
For the harness bias, we present the hardness-aware prototype sampling, which
can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen classes, especially
for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our method proficiently
manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable performance across
various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/Happy-CGCD.

Introduction

In the open world [1, 2, 3], visual concepts are infinite and evolving and humans can cluster them
with previous knowledge. It is also important to endow AI with such abilities. In this regard, Novel
Category Discovery (NCD) [4, 5, 6] and Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) [7, 8, 1, 9, 10]
endeavor to transfer [4, 11] the knowledge from labeled classes to facilitate clustering new classes.
However, they are constrained to static settings where models only learn once, which contradicts the
ever-changing world. Thus, extending them to the temporal dimension is important. In the literature,

Figure 1: The diagram of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). In this paper, we
focus on a more pragmatic setting with (1) more continual stages and more novel categories, (2)
rehearsal-free learning, and (3) no prior knowledge of the ratio of new class samples.

Discovery (C-GCD) [15, 16, 17, 18] aim to discover novel classes continually. C-NCD assumes
all data come from new classes, while C-GCD further considers the coexistence of old and new
ones. However, C-GCD still has some limitations, e.g., some works [15, 17] store labeled data of old
classes, causing storage and privacy [19] issues. Others [16, 18] consider limited incremental stages
and novel categories or assume a prior ratio of known samples [15], failing to reflect practical cases.

In this paper, we tackle the task of C-GCD, but with more realistic considerations: (1) More learning
stages with more new classes. (2) At each stage, data from previous stages are inaccessible [20] for
storage and privacy concerns. (3) Unlabeled data contain samples from old classes but are fewer than
new ones in each class, and the ratio of them is unknown. The C-GCD setting is illustrated in Figure 1
with two phases: (1) Initial supervised learning (Stage-0). The model is trained on labeled classes
to acquire general knowledge. (2) Continual unsupervised discovery (Stage-1 ∼T). At each stage,
the model learns from unlabeled data containing both new and old classes. Note that, old classes
include initially labeled classes as well as those discovered in previous stages. The core challenge is
managing the conflicts between discovering new classes and preventing forgetting old ones.

To explore the nature of the conflicts, we conducted preliminary experiments (Section 3.2) which
reveal two issues: Models (1) tend to misclassify new classes as old, leading to collapsed accuracy of
new classes, and (2) exhibit catastrophic forgetting of old classes. We summarize them as underlying
issues to be addressed: (1) Models display overconfidence in old classes and severe prediction bias.
(2) The features of old classes are disrupted when learning novel classes. Meanwhile, the similarity
between clusters varies, leading to biased hardness across classes for classification.

To address these issues, we propose a debiased framework, namely Happy, which is characterized by
Hardness-aware prototype sampling and soft entropy regularization. Specifically, on the one hand,
to better discover new classes during incremental stages, we utilize clustering-guided initialization
for new classes, ensuring a reliable feature distribution. More importantly, to mitigate the prediction
bias between new and old classes, we introduce soft entropy regularization to allocate necessary
probabilities to the classification head of new classes, which is essential for new class discovery. On
the other hand, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in rehearsal-free C-GCD, we model the class-wise
distribution in the feature space for old classes, and sample them when learning novel classes, which
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we devise a metric to quantify the
hardness of each learned class, and prioritize sampling features from categories with greater difficulty.
This helps the model to consolidate difficult knowledge accordingly and thus improves the overall
performance. Consequently, these designs enable our model to specifically address the challenges in
C-GCD, i.e., effectively discover new classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting of old classes.

In summary, our contributions are: (1) We extend Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-
GCD) to realistic scenarios. In addition, we propose a debiased learning framework called Happy,
which excels in effectively discovering new classes while preventing catastrophic forgetting with
reduced bias in the introduced C-GCD settings. (2) We propose cluster-guided initialization and soft
entropy regularization for collectively ensuring stable clustering of new classes. On the other hand,
we present hardness-aware prototype sampling to mitigate forgetting. (3) Comprehensive experiments
show that our method remarkably discovers new classes with minimal forgetting of old classes, and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across datasets.

Category Discovery.
Novel Category Discovery (NCD) [4, 5, 21] is firstly formalized as deep
transfer clustering [4], i.e., transferring the knowledge from labeled classes to help cluster new ones.
Early works employ robust rank statistics [5, 22] for knowledge transfer. UNO [6] proposes a unified
objective with Shinkhorn-Knopp algorithm [23]. Later works [24, 25, 26] exploit relationships
between samples and classes. NCD assumes unlabeled data only contain new classes. Instead,
Generalized Class Discovery (GCD) [7, 27] further permits the existence of old classes. Thus models
need to classify old classes and cluster new ones in the unlabeled data. Recent works handle GCD with
non-parametric contrastive learning [8, 28, 10] or parametric classifiers with self-training [9, 29, 30].
More recent works explore GCD in other settings, e.g., active learning [31] and federated learning [32].
In summary, both NCD and GCD are limited to static settings where models only learn once.

Continual Category Discovery.
Pioneer works [12, 13, 14] study the incremental version of NCD,
assuming unlabeled data only contain new classes, and we call them C-NCD. Recent works [15,
16, 17, 18] explore the incremental version of GCD, we collectively refer to them as Continual
Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD). GM [15] proposes a framework of growing and merging.
In the growing phase, the model performs novelty detection and implements clustering on the
novelties. Then GM integrates the newly acquired knowledge with the previous model in the merging
stage. Kim et al. [16] utilize noisy label learning and the proxy and anchor scheme to split the
data in C-GCD. Zhao et al. [17] propose a non-parametric soft nearest-neighbor classifier and a
density-based sample selection method. Orthogonally, Wu et al. [18] argue that the initial labeled data
are not fully exploited and present a meta-learning [33] framework to learn a better initialization for
continual discovery. Despite effectiveness, C-GCD settings studied by the above methods still have
some limitations, e.g., the number of stages is very few with limited new classes, and the assumption
of prior ratio of old classes or storing previously labeled samples is unrealistic [19, 34]. In this paper,
we extend C-GCD to more pragmatic scenarios, as shown in Figure 1.

Preliminaries

We first formalize Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) (Section 3.1). To delve
deeper into the issues, we conduct preliminary experiments (Section 3.2). Results reveal that models
are susceptible to two types of bias, which significantly degrade the performance and motivate us to
propose the debiased learning framework in Section 4.

3.1
Problem Formulation and Notations

Task Definition.
As shown in Figure 1, C-GCD has two phases: (1) Initial supervised learning
(Stage-0). The model is trained on labeled data D0
train = {(xl
i, yi)}N0
i=1 of initially labeled classes
C0
old = C0
init, to learn general knowledge and representations. We denote C0
new = None. (2) Continual
unsupervised discovery (Stage-1 ∼T). At Stage-t (1 ≤t ≤T), the model is fed with an unlabeled
dataset Dt
train = {(xu
i )}Nt
i=1, which contains both old and new classes. We denote the categories
in Dt
train as Ct = Ct
old ∪Ct
new. Kt
old = |Ct
old|, Kt
new = |Ct
new| and Kt = Kt
old + Kt
new denote the
number of “old”, “new” and “all” classes respectively. Note that, after the first stage, i.e., when
t ≥2, “old” classes include initially labeled classes C0
init and all new classes discovered in previous
stages, i.e., Ct
old = C0
init ∪{Ci
new}
t−1
i=1, and “new” classes refer to the classes unseen before. At the next
stage, new classes from the current stage become the subset of old classes, i.e., Ct
old = Ct−1
old ∪Ct−1
new .
The number of novel classes Kt
new at stage t is known a-prior or estimated using off-the-shelf
methods [5, 7, 35] in advance. After training of each stage, the model will be evaluated on the disjoint
test set Dt
test = {(xi, yi)}N t
test
i=1 containing all seen classes Ct
old ∪Ct
new.

Realistic Considerations.
Our C-GCD is more realistic than prior arts [15, 16, 18] in that: (1) More
stages with more new classes to be discovered. (2) Rehearsal-free. Previous samples are inaccessible
for storage and privacy issues. (3) At each continual stage, old classes have fewer samples per class
than new classes in the unlabeled data, and the proportion of old samples is unknown.

Notations.
At Stage-t, we decompose the model into encoder f t
θ(·) and parametric classifier gt
ϕ =

[{ϕold
i }Kt
old
i=1; {ϕnew
j
}Kt
new
j=1 ] with head of old and new classes. The classifier is ℓ2-normalized without
bias term, i.e., ∥ϕt
i∥= 1. The encoder maps the input xi to a feature vector zi = f t
θ(xi) ∈Rd. Here,

Preliminary Experiments: Two Bias Problems

We conduct preliminary experiments on CIFAR100 [36] using the model described in Section 3.1,
which is initially trained on D0
train and continually discovers new classes on Dt
train using unsupervised
self-training scheme [9]. Results reveal that models are prone to the following two types of bias.

Prediction bias in probability space. As illustrated in Figure 2 (a), the model’s accuracy for new
classes has collapsed. The reason is that old classes C0
old are trained under full supervision while new
classes are under unsupervised self-training [9, 37], which brings about overconfidence [38, 39, 40] in
old classes, as in (b). In this case, prediction bias could occur, where some new classes are incorrectly
predicted as old ones, which motivates us to constrain the model to give necessary attention and
predictive probabilities to new classes to compensate for this intrinsic gap, as discussed in Section 4.2.

Hardness bias in feature space. After adding constraints to ensure learning new classes (Section 4.2),
their accuracies significantly fluctuate across incremental stages, leading to unstable performance, as
shown in Figure 2 (c). The underlying cause is that some clusters are more similar to others in the
feature space, resulting in lower accuracy of these difficult classes. As in (d), hardness bias (defined
in Section 4.3) is obvious across classes. This paper focuses on the hardness of previously learned
categories Ct
old, and addresses how to avoid these biases in preventing forgetting in Section 4.3.

The Proposed Framework: Happy

Overview of the Method.
As shown in Figure 1, C-GCD has two phases: (1) Initial supervised
learning (Stage-0). The model is trained on labeled samples of C0
init (Section 4.1). Our contribution
mainly lies in (2) Continual unsupervised discovery (Stage-1∼T). Motivated by the conflicts between
new class discovery and the forgetting of old classes, as well as the two types of bias discussed in
Section 3.2, we propose the debiased learning framework Happy as illustrated in Figure 3. Specifically,
for category discovery, we propose initialization of new heads and soft entropy regularization to
resist prediction bias (Section 4.2). To mitigate forgetting, we consider hardness bias and present
hardness-aware prototype sampling (Section 4.3). The overall objective is derived in Section 4.4.

4.1
Supervised Training at the Initial Stage

At Stage-0, the model is trained on labeled data D0
train from a large number of classes C0
init to learn
general representations, which serves as the foundation for subsequent continual category discov-
ery. We use standard supervised cross-entropy loss on the batch B: Lcls =
1
|B|
P

i∈B −yi log pi,
where pi = σ(g0
ϕ(f 0
θ (xi))/τ) denotes the prediction. To reduce overfitting, we further employ
supervised [41] and self-supervised contrastive learning [42] in the ℓ2-normalized projection space:

4.2
Classifier Initialization and Soft Entropy Regularization

Continuously discovering unlabeled new classes is challenging, as prediction bias towards old classes
could collapse new class accuracy (Section 3.2). Therefore, we need to constrain the model to pay
more attention to new classes to ensure effective category discovery.

Clustering-guided Initialization.
Randomly initialized classifiers bring about unstable training.
We argue that clustering could provide a good initialization for new classes. Specifically, at Stage-t,
we employ KMeans [43] on Dt
train and obtain Kt = Kt
old + Kt
new ℓ2-normalized cluster centroids
{ci}Kt
i=1. Among them, the Kt
new centroids least similar to old heads, as measured by maximum
cosine similarity with them, serve as the potential initialization for new class heads:

⇒

new. (3)

Group-wise Soft Entropy Regularization.
Entropy regularization [9, 29, 30] is common to
avoid trivial solutions of clustering in static settings. However, at each stage of C-GCD, there are
generally more old classes. Directly employing it equally across all classes will allocate most of
the probability to old classes, leading to prediction bias and collapsed performance (as in Figure 2
(a, b)). To address this, we need to constrain the model explicitly. Considering that at each stage,
there are fewer new classes but more samples per new class, and old classes have been well-learned
previously, we propose to treat all old classes as a whole and the new classes as another, and derive
C-GCD as binary classification. Specifically, we first compute the marginal probability in the batch
p ∈RKt =
1
|B|
P

i∈B pi. Thus, pold ∈R = P

c∈Ct
old p(c) and pnew ∈R = P

c∈Ctnew p(c) are scalars
indicating the marginal distribution on old and new classes respectively, where the superscript (c)
denotes class indices and pold + pnew = 1. Then we propose soft entropy regularization on the
marginal distribution of the old and the new:

Lold,new
entropy = pold log pold + pnew log pnew.
(4)
In this way, the model could focus more on each new class, ensuring reliable learning in new classes.
We also employ entropy regularization within the new and old classes to avoid trivial solutions:

Lold,in
entropy =
X

c∈Ct
old

p(c) log p(c),
Lnew,in
entropy =
X

c∈Ctnew

p(c) log p(c).

---Page Break---
To sum up, the soft entropy regularization is employed in a group-wise manner on three groups, i.e.,
“inter old-new” (Eq. (4)), “intra old” and “intra new” (Eq. (5)), and we add them together:

Lentropy-reg = Lold,new
entropy + Lold,in
entropy + Lnew,in
entropy.
(6)

The soft regularization ensures effective learning of new classes. See Section 5.4 for more discussions.

Overall Loss for New Class Discovery.
To achieve self-training on unlabeled data, we perform
self-distillation [9, 37]. Specifically, we use another augmented view x′
i to produce sharpened q′
i
with smaller temperature τt < τp and employ cross-entropy loss to supervise the prediction pi:
Lself-train =
1
2|B|
P

i∈B ℓ(q′
i, pi) + ℓ(qi, p′
i). The overall objective for new category discovery is:

Lnew = Lself-train + λ1Lentropy-reg,
(7)

where λ1 controls the importance of the proposed regularization loss.

4.3
Hardness-aware Prototype Sampling

Modeling Learned Classes.
Catastrophic forgetting [44, 45, 46] is a notorious problem in continual
learning, especially when previous samples are inaccessible. Instead of storing seen samples, we
can model the feature distribution for learned classes. Since the data in each incremental stage are
unlabeled, at the end of each incremental stage, we perform class-wise Gaussian distribution in the
feature space using models’ predictions on Dt
train:

µc = 1

Nc

X

ˆyi=c
f t
θ(xi),
Σc = 1

Nc

X

ˆyi=c
(f t
θ(xi) −µc)(f t
θ(xi) −µc)⊤,
c = 1, · · · , Kt,
(8)

where ˆyi = arg maxc p(c)
i
denotes the prediction, µc and Σc are mean and covariance. Note that,
for Stage-0, we directly use the ground-truth labels instead of predictions in Eq. (8). We call µc as
prototypes. When learning new knowledge, one can sample features from old classes N(µc, Σc),
and classify them correctly to mitigate forgetting. We find a shared diagonal matrix [47] empirically
works fine, i.e., Σc = rI, where r is computed at Stage-0 as r2 =
1
K0
P

c∈C0
init Tr(Σc)/d.

Incorporating Hardness to Learned Classes.
As in Figure 2 (c), accuracy fluctuations across
classes are significant, and treating all classes equally leads to hardness bias and suboptimal results.
Intuitively, difficult classes should receive more attention during sampling. Here, we propose an
unsupervised metric, considering the samples with higher similarity to others are more prone to be
confused and therefore more difficult. We define hardness hi and obtain hardness distribution as:

hi =
1
Kt
old −1

Kt
old
X

j=1,j̸=i
cos(µi, µj)
⇒
p(i)
hardness = σ(hi/τh) =
exp(hi/τh)
PKt
old
j=1 exp(hj/τh)
,
(9)

where i = 1, · · · , Kt
old and phardness is the categorical distribution to sample classes. Those with
higher hardness are more likely to be sampled, which better suppresses the forgetting of hard classes.

Sequential Sampling.
We first sample categories from categorical distribution c ∼phardness and
then sample class-wise features from Gaussian distribution of the sampled classes zc ∼N(µc, rI)
for classification. The loss for hardness-aware prototype sampling is :

Lhap = Ec∼phardnessEzc∼N(µc,rI) −yc log σ(gt
ϕ(zc)/τp).
(10)

Overall Loss for Mitigating Forgetting.
As training proceeds, the feature space becomes outdated
for previous prototypes, we thus apply knowledge distillation [48] using the last stage model and
current training dataset, i.e., Lkd =
1
|B|
P

i∈B 1 −cos(f t
θ(xi), f t−1
θ
(xi)). The overall loss is:

Lold = Lhap + λ2Lkd,
(11)

where λ2 controls the weight of the knowedge distillation.

4.4
Overall Learning Objective

To continually discover new classes without forgetting old ones, we combine the losses for new
(Eq. (7)) and old classes (Eq. (11)), and contrastive learning (Eq. (1)) to formulate the final objective:

LHappy = Lnew + Lold + λ3Lu
con.

Datasets.
We construct C-GCD on four
datasets: CIFAR100 [36] (C100), ImageNet-
100 [49] (IN100), Tiny-ImageNet [50] (Tiny)
and CUB [51], each is split into two subsets:
(1) Stage-0, where 50% of classes serving as
C0
init constitute initial labeled data. (2) Stage-
1 ∼T (T = 5 by default). At each stage, the
remaining classes are evenly sampled as new
classes, along with all previously learned classes
to constitute continual unlabeled data. Detailed
dataset statistics are shown in Table 2.

Evaluation Protocol.
At each stage, after training on Dt
train, the model is evaluated on disjoint test
Dt
test, i.e., inductive setting, which contains both new Ct
new and old classes Ct
old. The accuracy is cal-
culated using ground truth yi and models’ predictions ˆyi as: ACC = maxp∈P(Ct)
1
M
PM
i=1 1(yi =
p(ˆyi)), where M = |Dt
test| and P(Ct) is the set of all permutations across all classes Ct
old ∪Ct
new. The
optimal permutation could be computed once using Hungarian algorithm [52] on all classes, and we
report “All”, “Old” and “New” accuracies as evaluate metrics.

Implementation Details.
Following the convention [7, 10, 18, 31], we use ViT-B/16 [53] pre-
trained by DINO [37] as the backbone, and fine-tune only the last transformer block for all experi-
ments. The output [CLS] token is chosen as feature representation. At Stage-0, models are trained

with 100 epochs. Subsequently, we train models 30 epochs at each continual stage with a batch size
of 128 and a learning rate of 0.01. We set {λ1, λ2, λ3} as 1 and temperature {τp, τh} as 0.1 while τt
as 0.05. All experiments are run on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.

5.2
Comparison with State-of-the-Arts

We compare our methods with (1) Kmeans [43] on pre-trained features, (2) GCD methods: Vanil-
laGCD [7], SimGCD [9], SimGCD+LwF [44], and (3) recent continual category discovery works:
FRoST [12], GM [15] and MetaGCD [18]. Since GM [15] requires storing exemplar samples, we
adjust it to sampling features. For a fair comparison, all methods use the same objective (Eq. (2)) to
pre-train the model at Stage-0. Results are reported in Table 1, Table 3, and Table 4.

Happy outperforms prior methods by a large margin. For example in Table 1, on IN100, compared
to MetaGCD [18] and GM [15], our approach achieves an improvement of 11.90% and 7.50% for ‘All’
accuracy, respectively. On C100, Happy improves the previous state-of-the-art by 3.45% and 13.60%
for old and new classes across 5 stages. Besides, our method produces more balanced accuracy
between ‘Old’ and ‘New’. These improvements benefit from our consideration of underlying bias in
the task of C-GCD and the tailor-made debiased components in Happy.

Happy effectively balances discovering new classes with mitigating forgetting old classes. To
decouple and analyze the two conflicting objectives, we use Mf and Md in [15] to evaluate the
overall forgetting of labeled classes and the discovery of new classes respectively. Table 3 shows that
VanillaGCD [7] and MetaGCD [18] struggle with category discovery due to the weak supervision of
contrastive learning. In addition, FRoST [12] focuses solely on new classes, at the expense of old
class performance. In contrast, our method effectively balances both, achieving improvements of
6∼12% in two metrics.

C-GCD with more continual stages. To explore more realistic and challenging scenarios, we conduct
C-GCD with 10 continual stages. Results in Table 4 demonstrate that Happy consistently outperforms
other counterparts, showcasing Happy is a competent long-term novel category discoverer.

5.3
Ablation Study

Here, we conduct extensive ablations on each main component (Table 5) and analyze how our method
handles the conflicting goals between discovering new classes and mitigating forgetting old ones.
Finally, we delve into the mechanism of hardness in our framework.

How does Happy achieve remarkable category discovery? In Table 5 (a), we observe that models
trained with only Lself-train are collapsed in ‘New’ ACC. (b) and (c) incorporate soft entropy regular-
ization and the designed initialization, respectively. In addition, (d) combines both of them and brings
significant improvements for new classes, e.g., 28.21% on CUB. From (a) to (d), the initialization

produces robust and desirable feature location, and Lentropy-reg mitigates prediction bias and ensures
necessary learning of new classes. Additionally, mitigating the forgetting of old classes also helps
((d)→(g)), as it ensures the preservation of general representations for most classes, which in turn
benefits the clustering of new classes.

How does Happy mitigate catastrophic forgetting? (f) includes hardness-aware sampling based on
(d), which improves ‘Old’ ACC by 2.59% on CIFAR100. However, without Lkd, the feature space
could drift significantly when learning new classes and become misaligned with the learned classifier,
which degrades the performance. As a whole, (g) incorporates Lkd to remarkably improve ‘Old’ by
4.43% and 1.95% on CIFAR100 and CUB. Similarly, better clustering of new classes also benefits
old ones because incorrectly classifying new as old can hinder the learning of old classes. In this
sense, the learning of new and old classes is mutually reinforcing.

How does hardness-awareness help C-GCD? To delve into the effective-
ness of hardness-aware modeling, we conduct ablations with and without it.
Results (average ‘All’ accuracy across 5 stages) in Figure 4 show that hardness-
awareness consistently improves performance across various datasets. We also
present sensitivity analysis on temperature τh in Eq. (9). As Table 6 shows,
τh = 0.1 is a proper choice. When τh is too large, phardness convergences to the
uniform distribution, which is similar to the one without hardness modeling. A
small τh also brings suboptimal results. In such cases, phardness becomes overly
sharp, resulting in the sampling of only a very limited number of hard classes,
which exacerbates the forgetting of remaining categories.

5.4
Further Analysis

Does incorporating class prior into regularization necessarily improve results? Without any prior
knowledge about the proportion of new and old class samples, we employ soft entropy regularization
in Eq. (4) to prevent bias. A natural question arises: Can the introduction of information about the
ratio of new to old class samples at each stage further enhance performance? To explore this issue,
we directly use the ground truth ratio of old and new samples pgt
old, pgt
new as a prior and modify Eq. (4)
as Lold,new
prior
= −pgt
old log pold −pgt
new log pnew. That is, using cross-entropy to supervise the model’s
predictive probabilities pold, pnew, which surprisingly degrades performance as shown in Figure 5. The
reason lies in the gap between the model’s predicted ratio of new class samples (pred new ratio)
and the prior ratio of new classes pgt
new (gt ratio), as revealed in Figure 6, which is caused by the
confidence gap between old and new classes (Figure 2). This gap ultimately causes the predicted
ratio of new samples to exceed pgt
new, bringing about degraded performance than using Eq. (4) without
any prior.

Unknown class number scenarios. Previous experiments assume
the number of new classes Kt
new is known, which often does not
hold in reality. At the start of each stage, we need to first estimate
the number of new classes before instantiating the classifier. Prior
arts [5, 7] query some labeled data when estimating the class number,
which is not applicable in the purely unsupervised setting of C-GCD.
Instead, we employ off-the-shelf silhouette score [35] to estimate Kt
new
in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we compute silhouette score
using mean intra-cluster distance and mean nearest-cluster distance

and select the number of classes corresponding to the highest score value as the estimation. Then
we utilize the estimated number for training and evaluation. Average accuracies across 5 stages on
CIFAR100 are reported in Table 7. Our method outperforms others when Kt
new is not known a-prior.

Happy could effectively mitigate two types of bias in C-GCD. As elaborated in Section 3.2, models
in C-GCD are susceptible to prediction bias and hardness bias. To validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method in bias mitigation, we design metrics to quantitatively measure these biases.
Specifically, for prediction bias, we provide two metrics: (1) ∆p(↓) = pold −pnew denotes the
difference in marginal probabilities between old and new classes (see Section 4.2). (2) ∆r(↓) denotes
the proportion of new classes’ samples misclassified as old classes. Both ∆p and ∆r are calculated
on the test data after Stage-1. The results in Table 8a from two datasets demonstrate that Lentropy-reg
effectively reduces prediction bias, with a significantly lower marginal probability gap and fewer new
class samples misclassified as the old. For hardness bias, we also present two metrics: (1) V ar0(↓)
denotes the variance in accuracy of the initial labeled classes C0
init. (2) Acch(↑) denotes the accuracy
of the hardest class in C0
init. Both metrics are calculated after 5 stages. Results in Table 8b demonstrate
that hardness-aware sampling effectively reduces hardness bias, with lower accuracy variance and
higher hardest accuracy. In this regard, the proposed modules competently alleviate both types of
bias, which is consistent with our motivation.

Conclusive Remarks

We tackle the pragmatic but underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-
GCD), which involves conflicting goals of continually discovering unlabeled new classes while
preventing forgetting old ones. We further identify prediction bias and hardness bias hinder the
effective learning of both old and new classes. To overcome these issues, we propose a debiased
framework namely Happy. The clustering-guided initialization and soft entropy regularization
collectively alleviate prediction bias and ensure the clustering of new classes. On the other hand,
by modeling the hardness of learned classes, we propose hardness-aware prototype sampling to
dynamically place more attention on difficult classes, which significantly prevents the forgetting of
old classes. Overall, our method achieves better discovery of new classes with minimal forgetting of
old classes, which is validated by extensive experiments across various scenarios.

Limitations and Future Works.
Due to the imbalanced labeling conditions between the initial and
continual stages in C-GCD, the model’s confidence is not calibrated and there is an obvious confidence
gap between old and new classes, in these cases, incorporating prior information even degrades
performance (Section 5.4). Future work should incorporate confidence calibration [38] into C-GCD
to further mitigate potential biases. Another promising direction is to devise competent class number
estimation methods for C-GCD, because in the unsupervised setting, class number estimation becomes
significantly challenging. Additionally, this paper primarily discusses classification tasks, while
future works could extend the C-GCD learning paradigm to object detection [54], segmentation [55]
and multi-modal learning [56, 57, 58].

More Discussions about the Task of C-GCD

In this section, we first provide a detailed explanation of the task of Continual Generalized Category
Discovery (C-GCD) and a comparison with class-incremental learning. Then we illustrate the
practicality of C-GCD studied in this paper through some examples.

A.1
Comparison with Class-incremental Learning

The core differences between C-GCD and Class-incremental Learning [20, 44] (CIL) lie in that
training data is fully unlabeled at each stage of C-CGD, by contrast, conventional CIL adopts a
fully-supervised setting. On the other hand, at each stage of C-GCD, the unlabeled training data
Dt
train contains samples from previously seen classes, which makes the task more challenging because
models need to implicitly or explicitly split the samples from old and new classes and then discover
novel categories. While in rehearsal-free CIL, at each stage, the labeled training dataset typically
does not contain samples of previous classes, otherwise it becomes the replay-based sitting and will
simplify the problem, because the training data is fully labeled.

A.2
Realistic Considerations of C-GCD

As mentioned in the main manuscript, we study a more pragmatic setting of C-GCD, whose specific
manifestations of realistic considerations are listed as follows:

More continual stages with more novel categories to be discovered.
Prior works [15, 16, 18]
mainly implement C-GCD with 3 stages given nearly 70% of all the classes serving as labeled classes.
This simple setting does not reflect real-world scenarios. Humans are lifelong learners over the course
of their entire lives, and our setting closely aligns with this situation. Specifically, the default setting
in this paper has 5 continual stages with 50% of all the classes serving as novel classes.

Rehearsal-free setting without storing previous samples.
Several works [15, 17] in C-GCD
require the storage of previous samples to construct a non-parametric classifier or mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. This store-and-replay manner could cause privacy and storage issues, especially in cases
with very long learning periods. While we study the rehearsal-free C-CGD.

The ratio of new class samples is unknown.
Some works study C-GCD by assuming that the
proportion of new class samples per stage is known, which facilitates the design of novelty detection,
owing to the fact that novelty detection [15, 39] typically relies on a threshold to determine whether a
sample is from novel classes. In our setting, we lift this restrictive assumption and our framework
Happy does not rely on the ratio. Instead, our method does not explicitly perform novelty detection,
but instead implicitly learns with soft entropy regularization and self-distillation.

At each stage, the number of samples of each old class is significantly fewer than the number
of samples in each new one.
If at each stage, the number of class-wise samples of old and new
classes is roughly the same or both have plenty of samples, then C-GCD degenerates to the static
setting of GCD where the catastrophic forgetting is inherently avoided because there are plenty of
samples for each class, which bring about desirable outcomes even using baseline methods. This also
contradicts the reality. Imagine a scenario where a student is growing up and entering different stages
of learning. For example, he is currently in college where he needs to self-learn many new subjects
like calculus and linear algebra. However, he occasionally encounters some old knowledge from his
high school days, such as trigonometry and plane geometry. In this case, new knowledge is mixed
with old knowledge, but the quantity of old knowledge is quite small.

More Implementation Details

Fair training in Stage-0.
We train all the methods using similar objectives at Stage-0, specifically,
for methods with parametric classifiers [9, 12, 15], we employ Linit in Eq. (2), while for methods with
contrastive learning and non-parametric classifiers [7, 18], we employ supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning on the labeled data, i.e., the last two terms in Eq. (2). The results of different
methods at Stage-0 are similar, as shown in Table 1, ensuring fair comparisons of subsequent continual
learning stages.

Model Details.
Following the convention of the literature [7, 10, 18], we use ViT-B/16 [53]
pre-trained with DINO [37] as the encoder, and fine-tune only the last transformer block for all
experiments. The output [CLS] token is chosen as feature representation. For the parametric classifier,
we use ℓ2 weight normed prototypical classifier [9, 30] without the bias term. The dimensionality of
feature space and projection space for contrastive learning is 768 and 65,536, respectively. Note that
all the feature vectors in the 768-dimensional feature space are ℓ2-normalized, i.e., hyperspherical
feature space, including the feature representation zi of each sample xi, the head of each class in the
classifier ϕi, the KMeans [43] cluster centroids ci in Eq. (3), the class-wise prototypes µc in Eq. (8)
and the sampled features zc in Eq. (10).

Training Details.
We train the models in Stage-0 for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1, and
30 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01 for each of the continual stages. We use a cosine annealed
schedule for the learning rate.

Hyper-parameters and implementation details of Happy.
For the weights of loss terms, we
empirically set λ0 = 0.35 and λ1 = λ2 = 1, and detailed hyper-parameter analysis is elaborate
in Section E.5. For the temperature, we set the main temperature τp = 0.1 in model predictive
probability pi and the τt in the sharp soft qi. We set τh in hardness distribution phardness as 1. As for
the temperature in the contrastive learning term, we follow prior arts [7, 9] and set τc as 0.07 and 1
for supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, respectively. When we compute Lold,in
entropy and
Lnew,in
entropy in Eq. (5), the distribution within old p(c), c ∈Ct
old and new classes p(c), c ∈Ct
new should be
firstly normalized whose summation across the class indices equals to 1.

Metrics of C-GCD

C-GCD is essentially a clustering problem, specifically for the unlabeled new classes. Following [7,
5, 9, 10, 18], the accuracy is calculated using ground truth yi and models’ predictions ˆyi

ACC =
max
p∈P(Ct)
1
M

M
X

i=1
1(yi = p(ˆyi)),
(13)

here, M = |Dt
test| is the number of samples in the test dataset and P(Ct) represents the set of all
permutations across all classes Ct
old ∪Ct
new. The optimal permutation could be computed once using
Hungarian algorithm [52], and subsequently ‘All’, ‘Old’ and ‘New’ are computed on corresponding
indices of classes. C-GCD utilizes inductive evaluation, i.e., models are evaluated on a disjoint test
dataset containing all of the seen classes.

To decouple and analyze the objectives of novel class discovery and preventing forgetting, GM [15]
designed new metrics, i.e., the maximum forgetting metric Mf and the final discovery metric Md.
They are defined as follows:

Mf = max
t {ACC0
old −ACCt
old},
(14)

Md = ACCT
new.
(15)

However, old classes at different stages are changing and expanding. in the above definitions, Mf
does not truly quantify the forgetting of the initial classes. On the other hand, Md only measures the
category discovery performance at the last stage, which overlooks measuring the accuracy of new
categories throughout the process. As a result, we re-define these two metrics as follows:

Mf = max
t {ACC0
init −ACCt
init},
(16)

Md = 1

T

T
X

t=1
ACCt
new.
(17)

In our metrics, Mf quantify the forgetting of fixed classes set C0
init which is more reasonable, and
Md measures category discovery of each new classes, which could more comprehensively reflect the
ability to cluster new classes. In the main manuscript, we use the re-defined Mf and Md to evaluate
models in Table 3.

E
More Experimental Results

E.1
Confidence Gap with More Confidence Metrics

Here, similar to the preliminary experiments in Figure 2, we train baseline models and provide more
metrics, i.e., maximum softmax probability, maximum logit value, margin and negative entropy, of
confidence distribution on new and old classes, as illustrated in Figure 7. The results consistently
reveal the severe confidence gap between old and new classes, which is the underlying cause of
prediction bias.

E.2
Performance of C-CGCD with Longer Stages

In the main paper, we conduct experiments with 5 continual stages by default. To evaluate models in
more realistic scenarios with longer continual learning stages, we provide more detailed results of

Performance under Unseen Distributions

We conduct experiments on the distribution-shift dataset. Specifically, we train models on the original
CIFAR100 dataset, and test the model on all 100 classes after 5 stages of training. Models are directly
evaluated on the unseen distributions of CIFAR100-C [59], e.g., gaussian_blur, snow and frost,
as shown in Figure 8. Our method consistently outperforms others across several unseen distributions,
showcasing its strong robustness and generalization ability.

E.4
Performance under Fine-grained Datasets

Furthermore, we have also conducted experiments on two more fine-grained datasets, i.e., Stanford
Cars [60] and FGVC Aircraft [61]. We adopt the default setting of C-GCD described in Section 5.1,
i.e., 5 continual stages and 50% of classes serving as C0
init initially labeled classes. Average accuracies

Hyper-parameter Sensitivity Analysis

We fix the weights of Lself-train and Lhap as 1, considering they are the main objectives for new and
old classes. As a result, our method mainly contains three loss weights λ1, λ2, λ3 for Lentropy-reg, Lkd
and Lu
con, respectively. Here, we give a sensitivity analysis on CIFAR100 and report average ‘All’
Acc in Table 12. As shown above, the model is relatively insensitive to λ3, whereas λ1 and λ2 have
a more significant impact. Overall, the optimal values for each hyper-parameter are close to 1. In
our experiments, we simply set all weights to 1, which shows remarkable results across all datasets.
Thus, our method does not require complex tuning of parameters and exhibits strong generalization
capabilities and practicability.

Potential Societal Impacts

This paper focuses on Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) and primarily addresses
the classification issues. From a more intrinsic perspective, it represents a paradigm of transferring
existing knowledge to continuously generalize and learn new information. Therefore, it can be
applied to a wide range of tasks and scenarios, such as reasoning abilities in LLMs [62] and multi-
modal models [58, 63], continuous pre-training and instruction tuning, and large generative models’
generalization abilities to novel concepts. In the fields of biology and health sciences, the principle of
C-GCD can assist the discovery of new species and drugs, which will help human beings understand
the ecosystem better and facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment of new diseases.

At its core, C-GCD involves leveraging and transferring knowledge learned from old categories to
learn new information better, embodying the principle of applying learned concepts to new situations.
From this perspective, old knowledge significantly determines the model’s ability to discover new
knowledge. If biases or unfairness are learned from old knowledge, these issues can also manifest
in the newly discovered knowledge. As a result, future works should pay attention to the bias and
fairness issues, specifically when learning old classes, and the scrutiny of newly learned knowledge.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the abstract and introduction, we present the studied task, and motivation,
together with the proposed method and contributions of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations including the confidence calibration issues and the
scope regarding the classification task in the Conclusion, i.e., Section 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer:[Yes]

Justification: We have presented implementation details in Section 5.1 and also the algorithm
pipeline in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

21


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/
Happy-CGCD.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We present the dataset splits in Table 2, and give details about the experimental
details in Section 5.1 and the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We report all the experimental results as the average over 5 runs, but we do not
report the error bars.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We introduce the experimental computational resources in Section 5.1, all our
experiments are run on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have carefully read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and make sure to preserve
anonymity.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the discussions in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

23


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: the paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited all the comparative methods and necessary adjustments in
Section 5.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We are currently organizing the codes and will release them as soon as possible.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
