Abstract

Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models
such as Gen2, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and pop-
ularity. Despite these strides, evaluating these models poses substantial challenges.
Primarily, due to the limitations inherent in automatic metrics, manual evaluation
is often considered a superior method for assessing T2V generation. However,
existing manual evaluation protocols face reproducibility, reliability, and practi-
cality issues. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-to-Video
Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a comprehensive and standardized protocol
for T2V models. The T2VHE protocol includes well-defined metrics, thorough
annotator training, and an effective dynamic evaluation module. Experimental
results demonstrate that this protocol not only ensures high-quality annotations
but can also reduce evaluation costs by nearly 50%. We will open-source the
entire setup of the T2VHE protocol, including the complete protocol workflow, the
dynamic evaluation component details, and the annotation interface code2. This
will help communities establish more sophisticated human assessment protocols.

Introduction

Text-to-video (T2V) technology has made significant advancements in the last two years and garnered
increasing attention from the general community. T2V products such as Gen2 [20] and Pika [18]
have attracted many users. More recently, Sora [65], a powerful T2V model from OpenAI, further
heightened public anticipation for the T2V technology. Predictably, the evaluation of the T2V
generation will also become increasingly important, which can guide the development of T2V and
assist the public in selecting appropriate models [40, 54]. This paper does a comprehensive paper
survey (see Appendix F for details) and explores a human evaluation protocol for T2V generation.

Automatic and human evaluation are the two main kinds of evaluation for video generation. In recent
years, nearly half of video generation papers conduct only automatic evaluation, such as Inception
Score (IS) [76], Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [34], Frechet Video Distance (FVD) [84], CLIP
Similarity [70] and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) [82, 49]. However, these metrics meet various
challenges, such as relying on reference videos for calculation, overlooking temporal motion changes,
and, more importantly, not aligning well with human perception [67, 54]. Undoubtedly, automatic
evaluation is a promising research direction, but human evaluation is more convincing so far.

Existing human evaluation for video generation also meets reproducibility, reliability, and practicabil-
ity challenges. Our survey reveals that few papers employ consistent human evaluation protocols,
evidenced by significant disparities in assessment metrics, evaluation methods, and annotator sources
across studies. For example, some papers [100, 53] use Likert scales while others prefer compara-
tive approach [40, 26]. Moreover, many papers lack detailed information on evaluation protocols,
impeding further analysis and reproducibility. Additionally, most papers rely on annotators recruited
directly by the authors, i.e., laboratory-recruited annotators (LRAs). These articles often lack quality
checks, which can introduce bias and affect reliability [8]. Furthermore, there is notable variation in
the number of annotations used across papers, ranging from a few dozen to tens of thousands, posing
a practical challenge in achieving a balance between credible results and resource constraints.

This paper introduces Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE), a standardized human evaluation
protocol for T2V generation. T2VHE consists of well-designed evaluation metrics, annotator training
encompassing detailed instructions and illustrative examples, and a user-friendly interface, see
Figure 1 for illustrations. Additionly, it introduces a dynamic evaluation module to reduce the
annotation cost. We further introduce the details of our protocol as follows:

2


---Page Break---
Evaluation metrics. Many previous research focuses on video quality and text alignment but neglects
the critical aspects of temporal and motion quality inherent to videos [103, 74], as well as ethical
considerations [2]. T2VHE employs four objective evaluation metrics: video quality, temporal
quality, motion quality, and text alignment, and two subjective metrics: ethical robustness and human
preference. For different types of metrics, annotators were asked to rely more on the definitions of
reference perspectives and their preferences to make judgments, respectively.

Evaluation method. Due to the complexities and potential noise inherent in absolute scoring [67],
T2VHE employs the comparison-based method, which is relatively annotator-friendly [8]. Critiquing
the reliance of traditional protocols on win rates, which may introduce biases and offer limited
insights into model performance [33, 22], T2VHE adopts the Rao and Kupper model [72] to quantify
annotations results. This approach enables more efficient management of pairwise comparison results,
yielding improved model rankings and score estimations.

Evaluators. While crowdsourcing platforms are often considered to gather high-quality annota-
tions [8, 15], our survey reveals that researchers primarily rely on LRAs. However, concerns about
LRAs’ reliability due to inadequate training and quality checks have been raised, potentially biasing
evaluation outcomes. To address this, T2VHE proposes comprehensive annotator training, including
detailed guidelines and examples to improve understanding of evaluation metrics. Experimental
validation shows that properly trained LRAs can achieve agreement with crowdsourced annotators,
affirming the effectiveness of our training approach in ensuring high-quality annotations.

Dynamic evaluation module. T2VHE incorporates a dynamic evaluation component to enhance
protocol efficiency. This component optimizes utility through two key functionalities: firstly, pre-
annotation sorting of videos using automatic scoring results, prioritizing the annotation of video
pairs considered more deserving of manual evaluation during the static annotation phase; secondly,
the dynamic annotation phase, which determines whether to annotate pending video pairs based
on differences in model scores. Experimental results indicate that this module reduces costs by
approximately 50%, while concurrently ensuring the validity of the annotation results.

Our study reveals several findings: (1) Post-training LRAs and annotators on crowdsourcing platforms
achieve consensus. The low quality of the pre-training LRAs’ annotations mainly stems from
annotators’ biased interpretations of evaluation metric definitions. Thus, furnishing detailed guidelines
and example training can substantially improve annotation quality, yielding results comparable to
those obtained by professional annotators. (2) Comparison-based evaluation exhibits significant
potential for optimization. It manifests an O(N 2) growth trend in the number of annotations as the
number of models compared increases. Our dynamic evaluation module reveals that judiciously
selecting samples for annotation can produce model ranking outcomes consistent with those derived
from fully annotated data, even when annotating only approximately half of them. (3) A substantial
disparity persists between open-source and closed-source models. While open-source models perform
well in some evaluation metrics, videos generated by closed-source models generally exhibit superior
quality and tend to garner greater popularity among annotators.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. We introduce a standardized human evaluation protocol for T2V models, comprising a
meticulously crafted array of evaluation metrics alongside accompanying annotator training
resources. Moreover, it lets us acquire high-quality annotations utilizingLRAs.

2. Our dynamic evaluation component reduces annotation costs to approximately half of the
original expenditure while maintaining annotation quality.

3. We comprehensively evaluate the latest T2V models and commit to open-sourcing the entire
evaluation process and code, empowering the community to assess new models with fresh
data based on existing reviews. Our protocol is also easily extended.

Text-to-video generative models. Creating realistic and novel videos has been a compelling research
area for many years [87, 71, 111]. Various generative models have been investigated in prior studies,
including GANs [87, 75, 83, 81, 77], autoregressive models [80, 105, 61, 23, 37], and implicit neural
representations [79, 113]. T2V generation focuses on producing videos from textual descriptions.

---Page Break---
Recently, the success of diffusion models in image synthesis has spurred studies to adapt these models
for conditional and unconditional video synthesis [86, 31, 123, 101, 5, 45, 107].

Evaluation metrics of video generative models. Evaluation metrics for video generative models can
be broadly classified into automated evaluation metrics and benchmark methods. IS assesses image
diversity and clarity through a pre-trained network [76], CLIP Similarity assesses alignment between
textual descriptions and generated images [70], FID and FVD compare feature representations from
real and generated images [34, 84]. Despite their usefulness, these metrics have limitations, including
bias, sensitivity to surface similarity, and inconsistency with human perception [67, 54]. Additionally,
VBench [40], EvalCrafter [53], and FETV [54], among other benchmarks, provide comprehensive
evaluations but may lack the diversity to cover all real-world scenarios, and these automated scorers
typically require alignment training based on human evaluation results. Given the limitations of these
automated metrics and benchmarks, high-quality manual assessments remain critical.

Human evaluation in video generation

We survey 89 papers on video generation models since 20163, and after reviewing how they use and
report human assessments, we have the following findings:

Automatic vs. Human evaluation. Among the 89 papers reviewed, 44 rely exclusively on automated
evaluation metrics. However, these metrics typically have limitations, such as only capturing certain
characteristics of the generated video [76], dependence on pre-trained models [70], and the necessity
for reference videos [84]. Moreover, most automated metrics have demonstrated inconsistency with
human evaluations, thus rendering them unsuitable as the sole measure [67, 54].

Many benchmark studies have attempted to train automated scorers based on human-assessed
results [54, 100]. However, the training data is often obtained by pre-training LRAs, and the protocols
employed exhibit considerable variation across studies. Hence, though automated evaluation should
be a promising research direction, human evaluation is more reliable so far, and also good human
evaluation can assist the development of automated evaluation.

Human evaluation metrics. The setup of human evaluation metrics varies greatly across papers. Ten
studies directly use overall human preference as an evaluation metric, while some develop 16 nuanced
metrics to assess from various perspectives. Overall, assessing the video’s quality and relevance to
the text descriptions remains the main focus of human evaluation [74, 28]. Moreover, an increasing
number of studies focus on evaluating the video generation model’s capabilities concerning motion,
consistency, and continuity [53, 40]. In addition, we found no study introduces ethical evaluation in
human evaluation, which is an aspect that warrants attention [48].

Human evaluation methods. Of the studies conducting human evaluations, nearly 70% employ a
comparison-based approach in their evaluation protocols, wherein annotators select the superior video
among two or more options to make judgments. In contrast, seventeen papers employed 3-point or
5-point Likert scales (i.e. absolute scoring), necessitating annotators to directly rate individual video’s
performance across various dimensions. However, this approach increases annotation complexity and
introduces higher levels of noise and disagreement [67].

Quantification of annotation results. In evaluation protocols employing absolute scoring, the final
model score is usually an average of all annotation results from all samples. On the other hand, pair-
wise comparison-based evaluation protocols often employ the win ratio to quantify annotations [40].
Thus, while comparison-based evaluations are more user-friendly, they often require the evaluation of
all model combinations to generate stable and reliable outcomes [22].

Annotators. Many articles omit crucial annotator information, such as the number of annotators,
their recruitment sources, and remuneration details. Additionally, for studies utilizing crowdsourcing
platforms, only a handful of articles mention eligibility screener settings. This information is vital for
gauging the reliability and ethicality of assessment results [67].

Annotator training and quality checking. Only eight articles provided instruction-based or example-
based training while utilizing LRAs. Moreover, merely two articles employed inter-annotator

popular ones since 2016. The full list of reviewed papers can be found in Appendix F.

agreement (IAA) for annotation quality checking. Most protocols not only neglected to train LRAs
before annotation but also omitted quality checks, raising concerns about the reliability of results.

Prompts. For different evaluation needs, researchers usually choose different prompts for generating
videos, such as HuMMan [6], which is specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained spatiotem-
poral motion generation. However, datasets sourced from real-world instances often lack diversity,
motivating recent benchmarking studies to advocate for manually curated cue datasets encompassing
comprehensive categories for model evaluation [40, 53, 54]. Due to different needs and different
sources of prompts, the number of prompts used in human assessment often varies by more than a
few dozen times from study to study, and many papers use fewer than 100 samples per model for
human assessment, such small sample sizes are likely to produce biased results [67].

Annotation interface. Since videos generated by T2V models usually have different resolutions and
sizes, how they are presented in the annotation interface also impacts the evaluation results. While
some studies adopt methods such as adding watermarks, frame sampling, or cropping to standardize
videos from different models [54], the majority only scale or leave generated videos unaltered during
annotation. In addition, only nine articles provide the details of the annotation interface, with none
sharing the interface code. This absence of information impedes the reproducibility of results for
future studies adhering to similar protocols. Moreover, the scarcity of reusable resources hinders the
ongoing enhancement of human evaluation protocols and practices [67].

Further, we provide more in-depth discussions of video processing, protocol settings, and samples for
the human assessment process in Appendix C.

Our protocol for text-to-vedio models

Our T2VHE framework comprises four key components: evaluation metrics, evaluation method,
evaluator, and dynamic evaluation module. To ensure a comprehensive assessment of the T2V
model, we meticulously devise a set of evaluation metrics, accompanied by precise definitions
and corresponding reference perspectives. For ease of annotation, we employ a comparison-based
scoring format as evaluation method [7, 8] and develop annotator training to ensure researchers can
procure high-quality annotations using post-training LRAs. Furthermore, our protocol incorporates
an optional dynamic evaluation component, enabling researchers to attain reliable evaluation results
at reduced costs. More details can be found in Appendix D.

4.1
Evaluation metrics

Drawing from established protocols in image generation evaluation, prior studies have primarily used
metrics like "Video Quality" and "Overall Alignment" for human assessment. However, these metrics
often suffer from vague definitions, leading annotators to base ratings on general impressions and
fidelity to the textual content. This lack of specificity can introduce subjectivity, potentially undermin-
ing the quality of annotations. Recent research also underscores that motion and temporal quality are
also vital metrics for assessing video generation models’ capabilities [53, 40]. Additionally, as video
generation technology gains popularity, its ethical and societal impacts are becoming increasingly
critical factors in evaluation [48]. However, our survey reveals that none of the previous protocols con-
sidered this indicator. Moreover, only ten studies provided specific training for annotators, suggesting
that the majority of research has only offered basic definitions of each metric without comprehensive
instructions or relevant examples, which are essential for ensuring high-quality annotations [15].

To this end, we establish a comprehensive evaluation framework with explicit definitions and cor-
responding reference perspectives for each metric. Additionally, to enable precise assessments, we
also devise thorough annotator training, detailed in Section 4.3. Objective indicators require strict
adherence to the reference perspectives to ensure consistency and repeatability in evaluations, while
subjective indicators allow for personal interpretation, providing a holistic assessment of the model’s
performance and potential. Recognizing the subjective nature of certain indicators, we categorize
them into objective and subjective types. Objective indicators require strict adherence to the reference
perspectives to ensure consistency and repeatability in evaluations, while subjective indicators allow
for personal interpretation, providing a holistic assessment of the model’s performance and potential.
Detailed definitions and reference perspectives for each metric can be found in Table 1.

4.2
Evaluation method

There exist two primary scoring methods: comparative and absolute. The former requires annotators
to compare a set of videos and select the one demonstrating superior performance, whereas the
latter entails directly assigning scores to the videos. Absolute scoring typically necessitates detailed
instructions and precise question formulations due to its complexity [8]. However, even with these
in place, absolute scoring could still result in noisy annotations and pose challenges in reaching
consensus among annotators [67]. Hence, we use the less challenging comparative scoring method.

Quantification of annotations. Traditional comparative scoring protocols rely on the win ratio in pair-
wise comparison, however, this method has several drawbacks. First, it can introduce bias if models
are not uniformly compared [33]. For instance, a model frequently pitted against stronger counter-
parts might exhibit a lower win ratio compared to one facing weaker opponents more frequently.
Consequently, a significant number of comparisons are required to establish reliable rankings [22].
Moreover, the win ratio alone does not reliably indicate the likelihood of one model outperforming
another [72]. To overcome these issues, we adopt the Rao and Kupper model [72], a probabilistic
approach that allows for more efficient handling of the results of pairwise comparisons using less data
than full comparisons. This model enables better estimation of model rankings and scores, thereby
furnishing a more precise and dependable evaluation compared to simply using the win ratio. The

4.3
Evaluators

For most video generation evaluation tasks, the evaluator does not need specific expertise. However,
using annotators from crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), still
results in higher annotation quality [67, 64, 66], as these workers have usually completed many tasks
and carefully followed the publisher’s requirements to ensure successful payment. Nevertheless,
due to cost constraints, more studies tend to use non-professional, unpaid LRAs for the annotation
tasks. Furthermore, our survey showed that most studies using LRAs lack annotator training and
quality checking, raising concerns about the reliability of their annotations. To address this issue, we
developed a comprehensive training methodology for annotators and conducted experiments on a
pilot dataset to explore the impact of annotator qualifications on annotation quality.

Annotator training. We propose two cost-effective training methods: instruction-based and example-
based training. Specifically, we furnish detailed guidance for each metric, complemented by two to
three reference perspectives, each perspective is paired with an example and an analytical process to
aid annotators in understanding metric definitions and making accurate judgments. Detailed training
interfaces are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figures 4 to 8.

Comparison of annotator qualifications. We assess three annotator qualifications: AMT evalua-
tors (who are required to hold an AMT Master designation), pre-training LRAs, and post-training
LRAs. Each AMT evaluator is compensated $0.05 per task and underwent both instruction-based
and example-based training to maintain high standards of annotation quality [67]. In the case of
pre-training LRAs, workers annotate tasks directly based on the problem definition for each indicator.
Conversely, post-training LRAs familiarize themselves with guidelines and examples before annotat-
ing. Five annotators are tasked with selecting the superior video from each pair in each qualification
category, as outlined in Section 4.1. Detailed annotation interfaces and the pilot dataset setup are
presented in Figure 1 and Section 5, respectively.

After collecting all annotations, we observe disparities in model rankings derived from AMT an-
notators compared to those from pre-training LRAs across various metrics. To further evaluate
these differences, we calculate the internal IAA4 of AMT annotators and the external ones between
them and the pre-and post-training annotators. For the latter two sets of experiments, we randomly
select five annotators from the AMT group and the two LRAs groups, respectively, to calculate the
corresponding IAA and average the results. As shown in Table 2, pre-training annotators demonstrate
lower agreement with professional annotators across multiple dimensions, evidenced by significantly

4A positive IAA value indicates that the ratings are more consistent than random annotations. For example,
the coherence rating of NLG in [43] achieves an IAA of 0.14.

---Page Break---
lower IAA than the other two groups. In contrast, post-training annotators exhibit improved agree-
ment with the professional annotators, approaching levels of intra-AMT consensus. Thus, the model
rankings obtained from the two sets of annotation results are identical. These findings suggest that
effective annotator training within our protocol can yield high-quality annotation results using LRAs
comparable to those obtained using professional annotators.

4.4
Dynamic evaluation module

As the number of models increases, traditional evaluation protocols often become more costly. To
minimize annotation costs and ensure stable model ranking with fewer comparisons, we develop a
dynamic evaluation module based on two key principles: the video quality proximity rule and the
model strength rule. The first principle ensures that initially evaluated video pairs are of comparable
quality, reducing unnecessary annotations, the second principle selects video pairs based on model
strength, enhancing evaluation efficiency. The specific process is as follows:

Before annotation starts, each model receives an unbiased strength value. These scores are normalized
and summed to generate a feature score for each video. Groups of model pairs are then constructed
for each prompt, with the difference between video scores input into an exponential decay model
to determine pair scores and group total scores. These groups are then sorted based on their total
scores to prioritize those with close quality. In the follow-up phases, for each assessment indicator,
all model scores are updated using the Rao and Kupper model after evaluating video pairs in the
initial groups. Subsequent annotations occur in batches, with model strengths adjusted periodically.
When evaluation results stabilize across all dimensions, i.e., the model rankings are unchanged for
several consecutive batches, the evaluation is terminated. We provide the implementation details of
the module in Appendix D.2 and verify its effectiveness in Section 5.3.

5
Human evaluation of existing models

We evaluated five state-of-the-art T2V models, including Gen2 [20], Pika [18], TF-T2V [94],
Latte [56], and Videocrafter [11], see Appendix D.1 for details. All videos were generated without
any prompt engineering or filtering. Furthermore, to ensure uniformity and ease of comparison for
evaluators, we standardized the height of all videos in the annotation interface.

5.1
Settings

Data preparation. We use the Prompt Suite per Category [40] as the source of prompts, which
comprises prompts manually curated from eight distinct categories. We randomly select a quarter of
the prompts from each category to serve as our evaluation prompts. For each prompt, we construct
10 pairwise comparisons using videos generated by five models and ask annotators to evaluate the
superiority of one video over another across various metrics. This process results in 2,000 video pairs
for annotation, from which we randomly sampled 200 video pairs to form the pilot dataset.

Annotators. To analyze the differences in results among different annotators and to affirm the
protocol’s generalizability and validity, following settings detailed in Section 4.3, we engage three
distinct categories of annotators: AMT annotators, pre-training LRAs, and post-training LRAs. Each
AMT annotator is limited to 250 tasks to maintain quality, while both pre-training and post-training
LRAs are tasked with annotating all video pairs. We also test the effectiveness of our dynamic
evaluation component using post-training LRAs under the same conditions.

5.2
Evaluation results

For annotators who don’t use the dynamic evaluation module, we collect the annotated data for all
video pairs under the six metrics, resulting in a total of 3 × 5 × 2000 × 6 annotations (three categories
of annotators, five in each category). Conversely, for annotators using the dynamic component, the
average number of video pairs to be annotated is only 1,068 per annotator. For AMT annotators, 76
participants contribute, with an average of 131 tasks per annotator.

Figure 2 summarizes the results of the quantified annotations, more detailed scores and rankings
can be found in Appendix D.4. As discussed in Section 4.3, the annotation results obtained by the
pre-training LRAs markedly differ from those of the other three groups, evident in the discrepancy

between the final model scores and rankings for each dimension. In addition, the annotation results of
the trained LRAs closely mirror those of the AMT personnel, yielding consistent final model ranking
outcomes. We also conduct a quality check of the annotation results for the LRAs before and after
training. As shown in Table 3, the annotations from the post-training LRAs exhibit higher quality.

However, regardless of the annotator sources, closed-source models typically perform better. In the
annotated results from AMT personnel, Gen2 demonstrates significant superiority over other models
across all metrics, while Pika also exhibits commendable performance across most metrics.

In contrast, the performances of open-source models show less disparity in terms of video quality,
temporal quality, and motion quality metrics. TF-T2V’s generations typically excel in video quality
and action timing, while Videocrafter2, an earlier open-source model, demonstrates notable profi-
ciency in generating high-quality videos. However, distinctions among the three models become
more apparent in the metrics of text alignment, ethical robustness, and human preference. Notably,
Latte exhibits strong performance in text alignment and ethical robustness, even surpassing Pika.
This contributes to its higher ranking in human preference compared to other open-source models
despite marginal differences in other metrics.

5.3
Module validation

As detailed in Section 5.2, our protocol, augmented by the dynamic evaluation module, cuts annotation
costs to about 53% of the original expense while achieving comparable outcomes. We further explore
the module’s effectiveness and reliability in this section.

Effectiveness. Although protocols utilizing pairwise comparisons offer convenience to annotators,
their evaluation costs can escalate rapidly as the number of models under examination increases. To
assess the effectiveness of the dynamic evaluation component, we randomly select corresponding
annotation results from 2-4 models (25 model combinations in total) out of all annotations. For each

median, interquartile range, and 95% confidence intervals of the estimates.

combination, we simulate the dynamic annotation process, calculating average annotation demands
and employing an exponential model to forecast annotation needs with escalating model numbers.
As depicted in Figure 3, our protocol with dynamic component demonstrates a nearly linear growth
in annotation demands as the number of models increases, greatly reducing the evaluation costs.

Reliability. We advocate for the reliability of the module both at the design level of the algorithm and
the result level. Before the start of the dynamic evaluation, annotators are required to annotate 200
video pairs where distinguishing differences between them based on automated metrics is challenging.
This step ensures that the samples most deserving of human assessment will not be discarded in the
dynamic assessment and that the initially estimated model scores are not biased by specific prompt
types, as elaborated in detail in the Appendix C.4.

To enhance the demonstration of this module’s reliability, we perform bootstrap confidence intervals
for the score estimates of each model across various metrics. As shown in Figure 3, the confidence
intervals for Latte, Pika, TF-T2V, and Videocrafter2 are consistently narrow, signifying precise
estimations. In contrast, the confidence intervals for Gen2’s scores are relatively wide, indicating less
stable estimations. This variance primarily stems from our dynamic algorithm’s frequent exclusion of
comparisons involving Gen2 due to its significant superiority over the other models. Table 4 details
the number of these omissions. Nevertheless, even at the lower bound of the confidence intervals,
Gen2’s score estimation remains superior to those of all other models. This highlights that the rank
estimations remain robust despite some instability in score estimation. Thus, our dynamic evaluation
provides reliable and consistent rank estimations while requiring fewer annotations.

Limitations

Our study conducts well-established human evaluation experiments on five state-of-the-art video
generation models, yet some limitations persist. First, because the T2V models used are relatively
new and contain two closed-source models, we do not offer technical improvement suggestions.
Secondly, there is potential for refining our dynamic evaluation algorithm. As the number of models
evaluated increases, improvements can be made to the initial settings of model strength.

7
Conclusion

To address the issues of reproducibility, reliability, and usability in previous human evaluation
protocols for T2V generation, this paper introduces the T2VE protocol. By employing well-defined
metrics, thorough annotator training, and a dynamic evaluation module, T2VE enables researchers to
obtain high-quality annotations by LRAs at low costs. We anticipate that future research could build
upon this protocol to further expand the study of human evaluations of generative models.

Statement of neutrality

The authors of this paper affirm their commitment to maintaining fair and independent evaluation of
T2V models. We recognize that the authors’ affiliations cover a range of academic and industrial
institutions, including those that developed some of the models we evaluated. However, the authors’
involvement is based solely on their expertise and efforts in running and evaluating models, and the
authors treat all models equally throughout the evaluation process, regardless of their origin. This
study is intended to provide an objective understanding and assessment of all aspects of the models,
and it is not our intention to endorse specific models.

Further Discussions

C.1
Preprocessing of the generated video

Our protocol is designed to ensure fair video evaluations by using a simple scaling method that
maintains clarity across all videos, regardless of aspect ratio or length. An extensive literature review
confirms that preprocessing methods can bias comparisons, so we emphasize that no additional
processing is applied, allowing annotators to assess videos in their entirety [40, 21, 100]. This
approach ensures that the unique strengths of each model are preserved and fairly evaluated. For
instance, using a uniform frame rate can disadvantage high frame rate models, while extracting
frames from long videos may not accurately reflect their advantages. Similarly, cropping or adding
watermarks can hinder text alignment evaluations.

In sum, while some preprocessing may be fair and essential for specific comparisons, simply scaling
videos is a more equitable approach for human evaluation.

C.2
Trade-offs between crowdsourcing platforms and LRAs

Although our evaluation protocol has diligently established precise definitions, reference angles, and
comprehensive annotator training for each metric and has eased task complexity through a comparison-
based approach, it does not imply that LRAS can entirely supplant annotators sourced from
crowdsourcing platforms. Firstly, in evaluating subjective metrics, personnel from crowdsourcing
platforms, given their diverse backgrounds, are better positioned to gauge the model’s universality.
Even post-training LRAs inevitably harbor certain biases, particularly evident in assessing the
metric of Ethical Robustness, where a definitive consensus between LRAs and AMT personnel

18


---Page Break---
remains elusive. Secondly, while employing LRAs facilitates easier training and quality assurance
of annotations, they typically require more time to complete annotations as they often engage in
voluntary work rather than salaried employment. Lastly, when conducting reviews of new models, the
use of LRAs introduces inherent biases, annotators naturally favor novel models, potentially leading
to questionable annotation outcomes [64, 66].

Therefore, despite our study showcasing the capacity of trained LRAs to yield high-quality annota-
tions, researchers must judiciously select annotators tailored to their specific research objectives.

C.3
Protocol settings for various needs

Our protocol is designed with broad applicability, enabling researchers with diverse objectives to
enhance and adapt it as required. Researchers can draw upon the training and analysis methodologies
outlined in our protocol to establish corresponding reference points, guidelines, and illustrative
examples for their own metrics. Furthermore, the guidelines and training proposed in this study can
be easily extended to other fields, and similarly, by modifying the automated metrics in the dynamic
module, one can also achieve efficient human evaluation of other types of protocols.

Regarding dynamic components, researchers retain the flexibility to adjust hyperparameters according
to their specific requirements. Our simulation experiments indicate that the number of annotations
necessary can be significantly reduced, potentially even below 53%, particularly when aiming to
attain stable model rankings on specific metrics.

C.4
Samples more suitable for automated assessment

In designing the dynamic evaluation module, we first counted the positions of different prompts in the
video pairs sorted according to the scoring results of the automated metrics, as shown in Figure 9. By
instructing annotators to assess the initial 200 video pairs, we ensure the model’s efficacy estimation
before initiating the dynamic evaluation draws from assessments covering all prompt categories.

This discovery also facilitates a thorough analysis of prompt categories necessitating human eval-
uation, where automated metrics might encounter challenges in identifying significant differences.
Notably, video pairs categorized under vehicles, scenery, and animals tend to be more discernible
by automated scorers, as indicated by their relatively minor presence among the initial video pairs.
Conversely, domains such as food and architecture often demand human assessment for nuanced
differentiation. These insights are equally informative for future endeavors to construct datasets
specifically tailored for human assessment.

C.5
Impact of prompt types

In our investigation of model performance across various prompt types, we input human annotation
results for eight distinct prompt categories into the Rao and Kupper model to rank the model scores,
as shown in Tables 8 to 15. The findings indicate that while there are minor fluctuations in evaluation
outcomes based on the prompt sources, models exhibiting superior performance, such as Gen2,
consistently maintain their high rankings irrespective of prompt variations.

However, it is worth noting that for cases where the overall strengths of the models are close, such
as Latte, TF-T2V, and Videocrafter2, different kinds of prompts may directly affect the results of
the rankings among models under each dimension. Consequently, our analysis underscores the
significance of employing class-wide prompts in human evaluation protocols, as they may provide a
more stable assessment of model capabilities.

D
Protocol details

Due to the problematic nature of controlling the quality of annotations, final results may vary
even when using the same assessment protocol and assessors [43]. However, it can be effectively
mitigated by a detailed description of the annotations and a harmonized assessment process [67].
We, therefore, report full implementation details of protocol use and provide example templates for
human assessment in the supplementary material.

Details of the model to be evaluated

Gen2 [20] is a closed-source multi-modal AI system that generates novel videos with text, images, or
video clips. We use the default parameter settings from the demo for T2V generation.

Pika [18] is also a popular closed-source model that enables users to convert simple text descriptions
into dynamic videos. We use the default settings on the Discord platform for video generation.

TF-T2V [94] is a diffusion-based T2V model, and we use publicly available model parameters and
commands to super-resolve the generated video after generating low-frame video.

Latte [56] is an open-source video generation model based on Latent Diffusion Transformer, trained
on FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, Taichi-HD, and UCF101.

Videocrafter2 [11] is a high-quality open-source video generation model trained using low-quality
video and synthesized high-quality images, we use its newly announced 512x320 checkpoint.

D.2
Dynamic evaluation component details

Evaluating multiple video models via pairwise comparisons becomes increasingly resource-intensive
as the number of models expands. To efficiently obtain stable model rankings, we propose a
pluggable dynamic evaluation module founded on two principles: the video quality proximity rule
and the model strength rule. It is important to note that the component of this module responsible
for automatic metrics calculations is executed on an A100 GPU. However, the remainder of the
protocol’s calculations can be conducted on a CPU. The details of the design of the algorithm are as
follows:

Principles

• Video Quality Proximity Rule
– Leverage the scoring results of automated metrics to allow human annotators to priori-
tize the annotation of samples that are difficult to distinguish with automated metrics.
– Ensures that initially evaluated video pairs have similar quality levels.
• Model strength Rule
– Determines the evaluation priority of subsequent video pairs based on model strength
scores.
– Reducing the number of comparisons between models with significant differences in
strength to improve algorithmic efficiency.

Evaluation Process

1. Initial Model Strength Assignment

• Each model is assigned an initial neutral strength value, indicating no prior bias.
2. Automatic Metrics Computation

• For each video, the following metrics were evaluated by a pre-trained scorer [40]:
subject consistency, temporal flickering, motion smoothness, dynamic fegree, aesthetic
quality, imaging quality, and overall consistency.
• Scores are normalized and summed to produce the feature score for each video.
3. Group Construction

• For each prompt, groups of model pairs are constructed.
• The absolute value of the difference between the scores of two videos in a pair is input
into an exponential decay model.
• The output value is the score of each video pair, and the sum of these scores forms the
total score for the group.
4. Sorting and Grouping

• Groups were ranked according to their total scores, with higher scores at the top
indicating less variation within the group.
• This preprocessing step does not increase the cost of our evaluation protocol.

20


---Page Break---
5. Human Evaluation Phase

• An initial set of video pairs is evaluated by humans, and model strengths are updated
using the Rao and Kupper model.
• Comparisons are then split into batches. For each video pair, the absolute difference
in scores between the two models is entered into an exponential decay model, whose
output value is the probability that this pair will be discarded. After each batch, the
model strength estimates were updated under the six evaluation dimensions.
• The evaluation ends when the model rankings stabilize, meaning the rankings of models
under each dimension remain unchanged for several consecutive batches.

We have also provided pseudo-code 1 and corresponding definitions D.2 for the dynamic evaluation
component to make this easier to understand.

Definitions

V : Set of videos
M : Set of models
P : Set of prompts
V(pri) := {{vk, vl}|vk and vl ∈V, shares the same prompt pri, and vk ̸= vl}
S(v) : V →R feature score for each video v ∈V
R : Human evaluation results for model pairs
g(R) : Estimate I using Rao and Kupper models based on R
I : An |M| × d matrix, representing scores under all metrics, where d is the number of metrics,
and Iij represents the score of ith model in jth metric
pair_score(vl, vk) : Score for a video pair vl, vk ∈V
group_score(pi) : Total pair score for a group of model pairs V(pi)
sorted_groups : Groups sorted by group_score
F({vk, vl}) : Difference in scores between the two models in the video pair

For the setting of hyperparameters, we set the number of N0 to 200 in our experiments, and each
batch contains 8 groups, i.e., 80 video pairs, and update the model strengths under all dimensions
every 5 batches, and stop annotating and outputting the final results after five consecutive times of
equal model rankings.

D.3
Rao and Kupper model

A naive method to evaluate the rank and performance of different models from the paired comparison
data is ranking them based on the win rate of each model. However, this method suffers from several
disadvantages: (1) in scenarios where not every model is compared against others, or some models
are compared more frequently than others, win rates can be biased. If a model is only compared
against strong models, its win rate might be lower than a model compared mostly against weaker
models [33]. (2) It requires a large number of comparisons to accurately determine the rankings;
otherwise, the estimation would suffer from high variance [22]. (3) Win rates could not provide
reliable estimations of the probability of one model beating another model [72].

The Rao and Kupper model [72] is a probabilistic model for the outcome of pairwise comparisons
between items, which can effectively overcome the naive method’s limitations. We adopt this
model to characterize our evaluation results and obtain the estimations of ranking and scores of the
text-to-video models.

Consider the paired comparison with t models. Given a pair of models i and j, let i ≻j denote i
beating j , i ≺j denote i losing to j, and i ∼j denote a tie between i and j. The probabilities of

P(i ≻j) =

,
P(i ∼j) =

(pi + θpj)(θpi + pj),
(2)

where pi and pj are positive real-valued scores of model i and model j, respectively, which can be
interpreted as the strength of the models. θ is a positive real-valued parameter with larger θ implying
two models are more likely to be tied.

Let nij denote the number of times model i is preferred to model j, ˜nij denote the number of times
model i is tied with model j. The likelihood function can be written as:

where p ∈Rt is a vector defined by p = (p1, . . . pt)T . The maximum likelihood estimation of p and
θ can be obtained by maximizing (4) numerically. However, obtaining human-evaluation data could
be costly. To reduce the cost, we use a dynamic evaluation algorithm to give reliable estimations with
fewer data.

Parameter Estimation Details. To obtain a stable estimation of the Rao and Kupper model parame-
ters, we restrict the parameter to a reasonable range and use the L-BFGS-B [73] algorithm to optimize

the log-likelihood function. We restrict all pi to be greater 0.01 to avoid numerical instability caused
by extremely small values. We also restrict θ ∈[e0.01, e10]. This is because θ can be interpreted
as the exponential of the tolerance within which the annotators cannot distinguish two models with
different "true" merits. Formally, according to [72], the probabilities in the model can be written as:

P(i ≻j) =1

4

Z +∞

−(Vi−Vj)+τ
sech2(y

2)dy

P(i ∼j) =1

4

Z −(Vi−Vj)+τ

−(Vi−Vj)−τ
sech2(y

2)dy,

where Vi = ln pi, which is interpreted as the "true" merit of each model and τ = ln θ is the tolerance.
We restrict τ in [0.01, 10] and therefore θ ∈[e0.01, e10].

Confidence intervals by bootstrap. We employ a bootstrap algorithm to derive 95% confidence
intervals for score estimations. Our dynamic evaluation algorithm operates independently on data
from each individual, with 2000 annotations per person. Rather than resampling from pooled data, we
generate 2000 bootstrap samples from the annotations of each person separately and then aggregate
these samples. We resample 1000 times, resulting in 1000 bootstrap estimates using our algorithm.
The confidence intervals are then calculated based on the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of these
bootstrap estimates.

D.4
Evaluation results

We further show the model scores obtained using different annotators and their rankings in Table 5,
and the results of the scores and rankings under different prompt types are shown in Tables 8 to 15.

D.5
Annotation interface and annotator training

We show the annotation interface in Figure 1 and the presentation corresponding to each evaluation
metric. For annotator training, inspired by [15], we use lightweight annotator training methods, i.e.,
instruction-based training and example-based training, which do not increase the cost of evaluation
but can effectively improve the quality of annotation.

Instruction-based training means providing detailed instructions for each metric based on the
problem description. We provide two to three reference angles for each metric to help annotators
better understand the definition of each metric.

Example-based training refers to providing examples for the evaluation process of each metric
based on instruction-based training. We provide an example for each reference perspective and an
analysis process based on the examples to help the annotator better perform the annotation task.

In addition, we informed all annotators involved in the study of the possible risks they might face.
The detailed training interface is shown in Figure 1 and Figures 4 to 8. We will be releasing the full
evaluation protocol code shortly.

More details about evaluation metrics of video generative models Evaluation metrics for video
generative models can be broadly classified into automated evaluation metrics and benchmark
methods. For automated evaluation metrics, the IS assesses image diversity and clarity through a pre-
trained network [76], while the FID compares feature representations from real and generated images,
enhancing sensitivity to image quality [34]. The FVD for videos examines temporal consistency
and quality [84]. CLIPSIM uses the CLIP model to assess alignment between textual descriptions
and generated images, offering a measure for text-to-image synthesis [70]. However, these metrics
have limitations: IS may prioritize diversity over quality and carry biases from pre-trained networks.
FID, despite improvements, can be influenced by superficial similarities and comparison dataset
quality. FVD might emphasize temporal over spatial quality, and CLIPSIM’s reliance on textual
data can introduce language and cultural biases [67, 54]. For the benchmark frameworks, VBench
evaluates video generation across multiple dimensions using tailored prompts and human preference
annotations [40]. EvalCrafter integrates 17 objective metrics refined by human opinions with diverse

prompts [53]. FETV categorizes text prompts into spatial and temporal attributes, combining manual
and automatic evaluations [54]. Despite advancements, these benchmarks still have limitations such
that they might lack the diversity needed to cover all real-world scenarios, potentially leading to
biases [40, 53, 54, 38, 100].

Given the limitations of these automated metrics and benchmarks, high-quality human evaluations
remain crucial. Human evaluations can capture nuanced visual and contextual quality aspects that
automated metrics might miss, which helps bridge the gap between algorithmic evaluations and
real-world applicability.

Human evaluation The natural language generation (NLG) community has long recognized the
need for human evaluations to complement automated metrics. Similarly, text-to-image generation
models have benefited from human evaluation to ensure the generated images are technically correct,
contextually appropriate, and visually appealing. For example, Lee et al. [48] introduce a compre-
hensive evaluation framework for text-to-image models called Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image
Models (HEIM), which evaluates models across 12 aspects and incorporates both human-rated and
automated metrics to capture the full spectrum of model performance. Despite these advancements
in the evaluation of text and image generative models, there remains a notable gap in the literature
concerning the human evaluation of T2V generative models, which highlights the significance of our
human evaluation protocol for T2V Models.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect
the paper’s contributions and scope. They provide a clear overview of what the paper aims
to achieve and the methodologies used, aligning well with the detailed findings presented in
the subsequent sections.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the paper does discuss the limitations of the work performed by the
authors. It helps set the stage for future work and encourages ongoing dialogue in the field.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

34


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We only conducted statistical experiments and analyzed the results of the
dynamic evaluation module, and did not address the theoretical analyses.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the paper fully discloses all the necessary information needed to reproduce
the main experimental results. The authors have been meticulous in detailing the methodol-
ogy, settings, and parameters used in their experiments, ensuring that other researchers can
replicate the study accurately and validate the findings.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

35


---Page Break---
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the paper provides all the code needed for the protocol.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the paper specifies all the training and test details, including data splits,
hyperparameters, the rationale behind their selection, and the type of optimizer used.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the paper reports appropriate information about the statistical significance
of the experiments.

Guidelines:

---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer:[Yes]
Justification: Yes, for each experiment, the paper provides sufficient information on the
computer resources required.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, the research conducted in the paper conforms in every respect with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]

37


---Page Break---
Justification: Yes, the paper discusses both potential positive and negative societal impacts
of the work performed.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, the paper describes safeguards that have been put in place for the respon-
sible release of data or models that have a high risk of misuse.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, the creators or original owners of assets used in the paper are properly
credited.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

38


---Page Break---
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, new assets introduced in the paper are well documented, and the docu-
mentation is provided alongside the assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, for crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, the
paper includes the full text of instructions given to participants, screenshots where applicable,
and details about compensation.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [Yes]

39


---Page Break---
Justification: Yes, the paper describes potential risks incurred by study participants, ensures
that these risks were disclosed to the subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
