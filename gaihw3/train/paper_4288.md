Abstract

Detecting and rejecting unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for
deployed neural networks to void unreliable predictions. In real-world scenarios,
however, the efficacy of existing OOD detection methods is often impeded by the
inherent imbalance of in-distribution (ID) data, which causes significant perfor-
mance decline. Through statistical observations, we have identified two common
challenges faced by different OOD detectors: misidentifying tail class ID samples
as OOD, while erroneously predicting OOD samples as head class from ID. To
explain this phenomenon, we introduce a generalized statistical framework, termed
ImOOD, to formulate the OOD detection problem on imbalanced data distribution.
Consequently, the theoretical analysis reveals that there exists a class-aware bias
item between balanced and imbalanced OOD detection, which contributes to the
performance gap. Building upon this finding, we present a unified training-time
regularization technique to mitigate the bias and boost imbalanced OOD detec-
tors across architecture designs. Our theoretically grounded method translates
into consistent improvements on the representative CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT,
and ImageNet-LT benchmarks against several state-of-the-art OOD detection ap-
proaches. Code is available at https://github.com/alibaba/imood.

Introduction

Identifying and rejecting unknown samples during models’ deployments, aka OOD detection, has
garnered significant attention and witnessed promising advancements in recent years [57, 5, 41,
48, 30]. Nevertheless, most advanced OOD detection methods are designed and evaluated in ideal
settings with category-balanced in-distribution (ID) data. However, in practical scenarios, long-tailed
class distribution (a typical imbalance problem) not only limits classifiers’ capability [7], but also
causes a substantial performance decline for OOD detectors [51].

As Wang et al. [51] reveal, a naive combination of long-tailed image cognition [39] and general
OOD detection [20] techniques cannot simply mitigate this issue, and several efforts have been
applied to study the joint imbalanced OOD detection problem [51, 22, 45]. They mainly attribute
the performance degradation to misidentifying samples from tail classes as OOD (due to the lack of
training data), and concentrate on improving the discriminability for tail classes and out-of-distribution
samples [51, 55]. Whereas, we argue that the confusion between tail class and OOD samples presents
only one aspect of the imbalance problem arising from the long-tailed data distribution.

To comprehensively understand the imbalance issue, we investigate a wide range of representative
OOD detection methods (i.e., OE [20], Energy [32], and PASCL [51]) on the CIFAR10-LT dataset [8].
For each model, we statistic the distribution of wrongly detected ID samples and wrongly detected

OOD samples, respectively. The results in Fig. 1a reveal that different approaches encounter the
same two challenges: (1) ID samples from tail classes are prone to be detected as OOD, and (2) OOD
samples are prone to be predicted as ID from head classes. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, we argue that
the disparate ID decision spaces on head and tail classes jointly result in the performance decline for
OOD detection, which has also been confirmed by Miao et al. [40].

To mitigate this problem, Miao et al. [40] developed a heuristic outlier class learning approach
(namely COCL) to respectively separate OOD samples from head and tail ID classes in the feature
space. Different from COCL, this paper introduces a generalized statistical framework, termed
ImOOD, to formulate and explain the fundamental issue of imbalanced OOD detection from a
probabilistic perspective. We start by extending closed-set ID classification to open-set scenarios
and derive a unified posterior probabilistic model for ID/OOD identification. Consequently, we find
that between balanced and imbalanced ID data distributions exists a class-aware bias item, which
concurrently explains the inferior OOD detection performance on both head and tail classes.

Based on ImOOD, we derive a unified loss function to regularize the posterior ID/OOD probability
during training, which simultaneously encourages the separability between tail ID classes and OOD
samples, and prevents predicting OOD samples as head ID classes. Furthermore, ImOOD can readily
generalize to various OOD detection methods, including OE [20], Energy [32], and BinDisc [5],
Mahalanobis-distance [28], etc. Besides, our method can easily integrate with other feature-level
optimization techniques, including PASCL [51] and COCL [40], to derive stronger OOD detectors.
With the support of theoretical analysis, our statistical framework consistently translates into strong
empirical performance on the CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT [8], and ImageNet-LT [51] benchmarks.

Our contribution can be summarized as follows:

• Through statistical observation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that OOD detection approaches
collectively suffer from the disparate decision spaces between tail and head classes in the
imbalanced data distribution.
• We establish a generalized statistical framework to formulate and explain the imbalanced OOD
detection issue, and further provide a unified training regularization to alleviate the problem.
• We achieve superior OOD detection performance on three representative benchmarks, outper-
forming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

conduct zero-shot OOD detections [41]. Other researchers add open-set regularization in the training
time [37, 20, 54, 53, 35, 30], making models produce lower confidence or higher energy on OOD data.
Manually-collected [20, 52] or synthesized [14, 49] outliers are required for auxiliary constraints.

Works insofar have mostly focused on the ideal setting with balanced data distribution for optimization
and evaluation. This paper aims at OOD detection on practically imbalanced data distribution.

OOD detection on imbalanced data distribution. In real-world scenarios, the deployed data
frequently exhibits long-tailed distribution, and Liu et al. [34] start to study the open-set classification
on class-imbalanced setup. Wang et al. [51] systematically investigate the performance degradation
for OOD detection on imbalanced data distribution, and develop a partial and asymmetric contrastive
learning (PASCL) technique to tackle this problem. Consequently, Wei et al. [55] and [40] extend the
feature-space optimization by introducing abstention classes or outlier class learning and integrating
with data augmentation or margin learning techniques, respectively. Sapkota and Yu [45] employ
adaptive distributively robust optimization (DRO) to quantify the sample uncertainty from imbalanced
distributions. Choi et al. [10] focus on the imbalance problem in OOD data, and develop an adaptive
regularization for each OOD sample during optimization. In particular, Jiang et al. [23] also utilize
class prior to boost imbalanced OOD detector, which is however constrained as a heuristic post-hoc
normalization for pre-trained models and unable to translate into training a better detector.

Different from previous efforts, this paper establishes a generalized probabilistic framework to
formulate and explain the imbalanced OOD detection issue, and provides a unified training-time
regularization technique to alleviate this problem across different OOD detectors.

Rethinking Imbalanced OOD Detection

In this section, we start from revisiting the closed-set imbalanced image recognition (in-distribution
classification), and extend to open-set out-of-distribution detection problem. Finally, we will reveal the
class-aware bias between balanced and imbalanced OOD detectors, and derive a unified training-time
regularization technique to alleviate the bias for different detectors.

3.1
Preliminaries

Imbalanced Image Recognition. Let X in and Yin = {1, 2, · · · , K} denote the ID feature space
and label space with K categories in total. Let x ∈X in and y ∈Yin be the random variables with
respect to X in and Yin. The posterior probability for predicting sample x into class y is given by:

P(y|x) = P(x|y) · P(y)

P(x)
∝P(x|y) · P(y)
(1)

Given a learned classifier f : X in 7→RK that estimates P(y|x), in the class-imbalance setting where
the label prior P(y) is highly skewed, f is evaluated with the balanced error (BER) [6, 38, 39]:

BER(f) = 1

K

X

y
Px|y(y ̸= argmaxy′fy′(x))
(2)

This can be seen as implicitly estimating a class-balanced posterior probability [39]:

P bal(y|x) ∝1

K · P(x|y) ∝P(y|x)

P(y)
(3)

The ideal Bayesian-optimal classification becomes y∗= argmaxy∈[K]P bal(y|x).

Out-of-distribution Detection. In the open world, input sample x may also come from the OOD
space X out. Let o be the random variable for an unknown label o /∈Yin, and i be the union variable

---Page Break---
of all ID class labels (i.e., i = ∪y). Given an input x from the union space X in ∪X out ≜X, the
posterior probability for identifying x as in-distribution is formulated as:

P(i|x) =
X

y
P(y|x) = 1 −P(o|x) ̸≡1
(4)

Correspondingly, P(o|x) measures the probability that sample x does not belong to any known ID
class, aka OOD probability. Hence, the OOD detection task can be viewed as a binary classification
problem [5]. Given a learned OOD detector g: X in ∪X out 7→R1 that estimate the P(i|x), samples
with lower scores g(x) are detected as OOD and vice versa.

3.2
Analysis of OOD Detection on Imbalanced Data Distribution

When ID classification meets OOD detection, slightly different from Eq. (1), the classifier f is
actually estimating the posterior class probability for sample x from ID space X in merely, that is,
P(y|x, i) [20, 51]. Considering a sample x from the open space x ∈X in ∪X out, the classification
posterior in Eq. (1) is re-formulated as P(y|x) = P(y|x, i) · P(i|x), the probability that sample
x comes from ID data multiply the probability that sample x belongs to the specific y-th ID class.
According to Eq. (3), we assume the proportion between balanced classification P bal(y|x) and vanilla
P(y|x) for each class y still holds.

Lemma 3.1. For each ID class y in open-set, there exists a non-negative variable γy(x), so that

P bal(y|x) = γy(x)· P (y|x)

P (y) , where γy(x) = 1

K
P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) ∈(0, ∞), P(y|x), P bal(y|x), P(y) ∈[0, 1].

In fact, γy(x) captures the likelihood difference for the same sample x between balanced and
imbalanced distributions, and also plays the role in constraining the multiplication results to (0, 1).
The proof can be found in Appendix A.1. Using Lemma 3.1, we reveal that there exists a class-aware
bias term β(x) between the OOD detection on balanced and imbalanced data distribution.

Theorem 3.2. According to Lemma 3.1, there exists a bias term β(x) = P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y)
between
P bal(i|x) and P(i|x), i.e., P bal(i|x) = β(x) · P(i|x).

Proof. Since P(y|x) = P(y|x, i) · P(i|x), from Lemma 3.1, P bal(y|x) can be further expressed as
P bal(y|x) = γy(x) · P (y|x,i)

P (y)
· P(i|x). According to Eq. (4), it can be formulated as: P bal(i|x) =
P

y P bal(y|x) = P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y) P(i|x) ≜β(x)·P(i|x), where β(x) = P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y) .

Based on Theorem 3.2, we conclude that the original OOD posterior P(i|x) estimated by the detector
g(x), with the bias term β(x), causes the performance gap for OOD detection on balanced and
imbalanced data distributions. To understand this further, we will first discuss the scenario under ideal
conditions and then extend our analysis to real-world scenarios, attempting to analyze the intrinsic
bias of the out-of-distribution problem in both cases.

On ideal class-balanced distribution, the data likelihood P(x|y) = P bal(x|y), so that γy(x) ≡1

K .
From Theorem 3.2, β(x) = P

y

K
P (y|x,i)

P (y) . Meanwhile, the class prior P(y) ≡1

K , and the summary
of in-distribution classification probabilities equals 1 (i.e., P

y P(y|x, i) = 1), making the bias item
β(x) = P

y P(y|x, i) = 1. Ultimately, Theorem 3.2 indicates P bal(i|x) = P(i|x), where the
detector g(x) exactly models the balanced OOD detection.

On more challenging class-imbalanced distribution, the class prior P(y) is a class-specific variable
for ID categories, and β(x) = P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y)
̸≡1. In previous works[20, 51], the class posterior
P(y|x, i) is usually estimated with a softmax function by classifier f, and the class prior P(y) adopts
the sample frequency for each ID class. γy(x) is under-explored and simply treated as a constant.
Under this circumstance, since P

y P(y|x, i) = 1, the bias item can be viewed as a weighted sum of
the reciprocal prior

P (y). Theorem 3.2 explains how β(x) causes the gap between balanced (ideal)
ID/OOD probability P bal(i|x) and imbalanced (learned) P(i|x):

• Given a sample x from an ID tail-class yt with a small prior P(yt), when the classification
probability P(yt|x, i) gets higher, the term β(x) becomes larger. Compared to the original
P(i|x) (learned by g), the calibrated probability P bal(i|x) i.e., P(i|x) · β(x) is more likely to
identify the sample x as in-distribution, rather than OOD.
• Given a sample x′ from OOD data, as the classifier f tends to produce a higher head-class
probability P(yh|x′, i) and a lower tail-class P(yt|x′, i) [23], the term β(x′) becomes smaller.
Compared to the original P(i|x′), the calibrated probability P bal(i|x′) i.e., P(i|x′) · β(x′) is
more likely to identify the sample x′ as out-of-distribution, rather than ID.

The above analysis is consistent with the statistical behaviors (see Fig. 1) of a vanilla OOD detector g.
Compared to an ideal balanced detector gbal, g is prone to wrongly detect ID samples from tail class
as OOD, and simultaneously wrongly detect OOD samples as head class from ID.

3.3
Towards Balanced OOD Detector Learning

To address the identified bias in OOD detection due to class imbalance, we present a unified approach
from a statistical perspective. Our goal is to push the learned detector g towards the balanced gbal.
We outline the overall formula for estimating the OOD posterior below.

Specially, we use the common practices [39, 23] to estimate the probability distribution P bal(i|x) =
P

y P bal(y|x) = P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y) P(i|x) in Theorem 3.2:

First, for the class prior P(y), we use the label frequency of the training dataset [8, 39], expressed as
P(y) :=
ny
P

y′ ny′ ≜πy, where ny refers to the number of instances in class y. For the class posterior

P(y|x, i), given a learned classifier f, the classification probability can be estimated using a softmax
function [39, 23]: P(y|x, i) :=
efy(x)
P

y′ e
fy′ (x) ≜py|x,i, where fy(x) represents the logit for class y.

For the OOD posterior P(i|x), since OOD detection is a binary classification task [5], the posterior
probability for an arbitrary OOD detector g [20, 32, 28] can be estimated using a sigmoid function:
P(i|x) :=
1
1+e−g(x) , where g(x) is the ID/OOD logit. Finally, for the class-specific scaling factor
γy(x), estimating γy(x) is a sophisticated problem in long-tailed image recognition [39, 25]. To
focus on the OOD detection problem, we use a parametric mapping γy;θ : x 7→(0, ∞), where θ are
learnable parameters that are optimized through gradient back-propagation.

This unified approach allows us to systematically estimate and correct for the bias introduced by class
imbalance, thereby improving the performance of OOD detection in real-world scenarios. According
to Theorem 3.2, the balanced OOD detectors gbal is modeled as:

σ(gbal(x)) =

 X

y
γy;θ(x)py|x,i

πy

!

· σ(g(x)) ≜β(x) · σ(g(x))
(5)

Substitute the sigmoid function σ(z) =
1
1+e−z into Eq. (5), we have:

g(x) = gbal(x) −log
h
(β(x) −1) · egbal(x) + β(x)
i
(6)

The derivation is displayed in Appendix A.3. In order to make the detector g(x) directly estimate the
balanced OOD detection distribution, we can apply the binary cross-entropy loss on calibrated logits:

Lood = LBCE

g(x) −log
h
(β(x) −1) · eg(x) + β(x)
i
, t

≜LBCE (g(x) −∆(x), t)
(7)

where t = 1{x ∈X in} indicates whether the sample x comes from ID or not. For a ID sample from
tail classes with t = 1, discussed in Sec. 3.2, the bias β is larger than samples from head classes.
In this situation, the punishment ∆correspondingly increases, which encourages the detector g to
generate a higher score g(x) to reduce the loss. On the other hand, for a OOD sample that predicted
as a head ID class by classifier f, β and ∆become smaller than those predicted as tail ID classes,
and g are further forced to reduce the score g(x) to decrease the loss, as the label t for OOD samples
is 0. In practice, to alleviate the optimization difficulty, the ∆(x) for ID samples (with t = 1) is cut

5


---Page Break---
off to be non-negative value, and ∆(x′) for OOD samples (with t = 0) is cut off to be non-positive
values, ensuring the optimization direct dose not conflict with the vanilla BCE loss function.

Meanwhile, according to Lemma 3.1, we add an extra constraint on γy;θ to ensure the posterior
estimate P bal(y|x) = γy(x) ·
py|x,i

πy
· σ(g(x)) and P bal(i|x) = P

y P bal(y|x) will not exceed 1:

Lγ = max

(

0,
X

y
γy;θ(x) · py|x,i

πy
· σ(g(x)) −1

)

= max {0, β(x) · σ(g(x)) −1}
(8)

Note that for each class y, the term
py|x,i

πy
· σ(g(x)) > 0 always holds, so that we only have to
constrain the summary on all classes P bal(i|x) = P

y P bal(y|x) within 1, as indicated in Eq. (8), and
P bal(y|x) for each class y will be constrained as well.

Combining with Lood and Lγ for optimization, the learned OOD detector g∗has already estimated
the balanced P bal(i|x). We thus predict the ID/OOD probability as usual: ˆp(i|x) =
1
1+e−g∗(x) . The
other terms like γ, β, and ∆are no longer needed to compute, maintaining the inference efficiency
and simplicity for OOD detection applications.

Experiments

In this section, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our ImOOD on several representative
imbalanced OOD detection benchmarks. The experimental setup is described in Sec. 4.1, based on
which extensive experiments and discussions are displayed in Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.3.

4.1
Setup

Datasets. Following the literature [51, 23, 10, 40], we use the popular CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-
LT [8], and ImageNet-LT [34] as imbalanced in-distribution datasets.

For CIFAR10/100-LT benchmarks, the imbalance ratio (i.e., ρ = maxy(ny)/ miny(ny)) is set as
100 [8, 51]. The original CIAFR10/100 test sets are kept for evaluating the ID classification capability.
For OOD detection, the TinyImages80M [50] is adopted as the auxiliary OOD training data, and the
test set is semantically coherent out-of-distribution (SC-OOD) benchmark [56].

For the large-scale ImageNet-LT benchmark, training samples are sampled from the original
ImageNet-1k [12] dataset, and the validation set is taken for evaluation. We follow the OOD
detection setting as Wang et al. [51] to use ImageNet-Extra as auxiliary OOD training and ImageNet-
1k-OOD for testing. Randomly sampled from ImageNet-22k [12], ImageNet-Extra contains 517,711
images belonging to 500 classes, and ImageNet-1k-OOD consists of 50,000 images from 1,000
classes. All the classes in ImageNet-LT, ImageNet-Extra, and ImageNet-1k-OOD are not overlapped.

Evaluation Metrics. For OOD detection, we report three metrics: (1) AUROC, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve, (2) AUPR, the area under the precision-recall curve, and (3)
FPR95, the false positive rate of OOD samples when the true positive rate of ID samples are 95%. For
ID classification, we measure the macro accuracy of the classifier. We report the mean and standard
deviation of performance (%) over six random runs for each method.

Implementation Details. For the ID classifier f, following the settings of Wang et al. [51], we
train ResNet18 [18] models on the CIFAR10/100LT benchmarks, and leverage ResNet50 models for
the ImageNet-LT benchmark. Logit adjustment loss [39] is adopted to alleviate the imbalanced ID
classification. Detailed settings are displayed in Appendix B.1. For the OOD detector g, as Bitterwolf
et al. [5] suggest, we implement g as a binary discriminator (abbreviated as BinDisc) to perform
ID/OOD identification. Detector g shares the same backbone (feature extractor) as classifier f, and g
only attaches an additional output node to the classification layer of f. In addition, we also add a
linear layer on top of the backbone to produce the γ factors to perform the training regularization with
Eq. (7) and Eq. (8). To reduce the optimization difficulty, the gradient is stopped between Eq. (7) and
Eq. (8) (but still shared in the backbone), where Eq. (7) aims at training g while Eq. (8) only optimize
γ. Furthermore, to verify the versatility of our method, we also implement several representative

Methods for comparison. In the following sections, we mainly compare our method on three
benchmarks with the typical OOD detectors including OE [20], Energy [32], and BinDisc [5], as
well as some state-of-the-art detectors such as PASCL [51], ClassPrior [23], EAT [55], COCL [40],
etc.. Specifically, as the results on the ImageNet-LT benchmark reported by COCL share a large
discrepancy against PASCL (especially the AUPR measure), we re-implement COCL based on their
released code1 and report the aligned results in Tab. 2.

4.2
Main Results

ImOOD significantly outperforms previous SOTA methods on CIFAR10/100-LT benchmarks.
As shown in Tab. 1, our ImOOD achieves new SOTA performance on both of CIFAR10/100-LT
benchmarks. Built on top of the strong baseline PASCL [51], our method leads to 1.9% increase of
AUROC, 3.2% increase of AUPR, and 4.6% decrease of FPR95 on CIFAR10-LT, with 0.9% - 1.8%
enhancements of respective evaluation metrics on CIFAR100-LT. By integrating with COCL [40], our
ImOOD further pushes the imbalanced OOD detection on CIFAR10/100-LT benchmarks towards a
higher performance, e.g., achieving 93.55%/78.50% of AUROC respectively. To further demonstrate
the efficacy, we validate our method on the real-world large-scale ImageNet-LT [34] benchmark, and
the results are displayed below.

ImOOD achieves superior performance on the ImageNet-LT benchmark. As Tab. 2 implies,
our ImOOD brings significant improvements against PASCL, e.g., 6.7% increase on AUROC and
13.2% decrease on FPR95, and further enhance the SOTA method COCL for a better OOD detection
performance, e.g., 75.84 of AUROC. Since the performance enhancement is much greater than
those on CIFAR10/100-LT benchmarks, we further statistic the class-aware error distribution on
wrongly detected ID/OOD sample in Fig. A1. The results indicate our method builds a relatively
better-balanced OOD detector on ImageNet-LT, which leads to higher performance improvements.
Besides, as we follow the literature [51, 40] to employ ResNet18 on CIFAR10/100-LT while adopt
ResNet50 on ImageNet-LT, the model capacity also seems to play a vital role in balancing the OOD
detection on imbalanced data distribution, particularly in more challenging real-world scenarios.

Additional comparison following ClassPrior’s setting. Since ClassPrior [23] uses a totally different
setting against the literature [51, 40] on the ImageNet datasets, including different ID imbalance ratio
and OOD test sets, we additionally compare with ClassPrior in Tab. 3. For a fair comparison, as
ClassPrior does not leverage real OOD data for training, we eliminate the auxiliary ImageNet-Extra
dataset and utilize the recent VOS [14] technique to generate OOD syntheses for our regularization.
According to Tab. 3, our method consistently outperforms ClassPrior by a large margin on all subsets.

Ablation Studies

In this section, we conduct in-depth ablation studies on the CIFAR10-LT benchmark to assess the
validity and versatility of our proposed ImOOD framework, and the results are reported as follows.

Lemma 3.1 (P bal(y|x) = γy(x) · P (y|x)

P (y) ) is consistent with empirical results. To validate that
the coefficient γy(x) depends on input sample x and differs for each class y, we perform a series
of ablation studies in Tab. 4. We first build a baseline model with BinDisc [5] only, and no extra
regularization is adopted to mitigate the imbalanced OOD detection. As shown in the first row from
Tab. 4, the baseline (denoted as none of γy estimates) presents a fair OOD detection performance
(e.g., 90.06% of AUROC and 33.39% of FPR95). Then, we simply take γy as a constant for all
classes (denoted as γy := const) by assuming P bal(x|y) = P(x|y) and γy := 1

K (see Appendix A.1)
to apply the training regularization in Sec. 3.3. According to Tab. 4, the OOD detection performance
receives a slight decline of AUROC (from 90.06% to 89.75%), despite the better FPR95 result.
Consequently, after treating γy as a learnable variable for each class y (denoted as γy := γy;θ),
the detector receives significant improvement on all the three measures of AUROC, AUPR, and
FPR95. Finally, setting γy as an input-dependent and class-aware learnable variable (denoted as
γy := γy;θ(x)) brings further OOD detection enhancement.

ID samples from head to tail (left to right) class indices; (2) Lower: distributions on OOD samples
predicted as head to tail (left to right) ID classes.

In addition, we further statistics the practical distribution of γ in Fig. 2, where γy(x) is relatively
higher for the ID sample from head classes. It is consistent with γy(x) =
1
K
P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) (see Ap-
pendix A.1), as the data likelihood P(x|y) is close to the balanced situation (P bal(x|y)) for head
samples while over-estimated for tail classes, leading to a higher fraction of P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) for head classes
and lower for tail classes. Detailed discussion is presented in Appendix A.2.

The designed training-time regularization in Sec. 3.3 is effective. As shown in Tab. 4, compared
with the BinDisc baseline in the first row, adding Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) by setting γy := γy;θ(x) leads
to significant improvement on the OOD detection performance (i.e., 2.2% increase of AUROC and
3.4% decrease of FPR95). As Fig. 2 shows, the automatically learned adjustments (e.g., β and ∆)
are consistent with our motivation, where we aim to punish the ID data from tail classes with a
large positive ∆, as well as the OOD samples predicted as ID head classes with a large negative ∆
(Sec. 3.3). Moreover, as indicated by Tab. 4, integrating with PASCL [51] and COCL [40] techniques
further boosts the imbalanced OOD detection, ultimately resulting in a new SOTA performance.

ImOOD generalizes to various OOD detection methods. To verify the versatility of our statistical
framework, we implement the ImOOD framework with different OOD detectors beside BinDisc,
including the OE [20], Energy [32], and the Mahalanobis distance [24]. For those detectors, we
add an extra linear layer to conduct logistic regression on top of their vanilla OOD scores (see
Appendix B.2), and leverage our training-time regularization to optimize those detectors in a unified
manner. According to the results presented in Tab. 5, our ImOOD consistently boosts the original
OOD detectors by a large margin on all the AUROC, AUPR, and FPR95 measures. In real-world
applications, one may choose a proper formulation of our ImOOD to meet specialized needs.

ImOOD is robust to different OOD test sets. In the preceding sections, we evaluated our method on
the CIFAR10-LT benchmark, where the SCOOD test set [56] comprises 6 subsets covering different
scenarios. As suggested by Fort et al. [17], the SVHN subset can be viewed as far OOD, and the

9


---Page Break---
CIFAR100 subset can be seen as near OOD (with CIFAR10-LT as ID). According to the detailed
results in Tab. 6, our ImOOD brings consistent enhancement against the strong baseline PASCL
regardless of the near or far OOD test set. Furthermore, we also report the spurious OOD detection
evaluation in Tab. 6. Specifically, we follow Ming et al. [42] to take WaterBird as the imbalanced
ID dataset, which also suffers from the imbalance problem (on water birds and land birds), and
a subset of Places [59] as the spurious OOD test set (with spurious correlation to background).
Results in Tab. 6 also demonstrate our method’s robustness in handling spurious OOD problems,
with a considerable improvement of 4.3% increase on AUROC and 5.96% decrease on FPR95. The
robustness of ImOOD to various OOD testing scenarios is verified.

4.4
ImOOD’s Inference-time Application

Despite our main focus on training more balanced OOD detectors, we also make some attempts
to apply our method during pre-trained models’ inference. According to our Theorem 3.2, for an
existing OOD detector P(i|x) (e.g., trained with BinDisc), we can calculate the bias term β(x) to
regulate the vanilla scorer P(i|x) into balanced P bal(i|x) = β(x) · P(i|x). However, as β(x) =
P

y γy(x) P (y|x,i)

P (y) , the estimation of γy(x) presents considerable difficulty without training, but we
have also tried some trivial approaches in Tab. 7.

Table 7: Attempts to apply our ImOOD into pre-trained models’ inference stages.

First, we simply treat γy(x) as a constant (e.g., γy(x) ≡γ1 = 1) for arbitrary input x and class y to
calculate the bias term (denoted as β1(x)), and the results on CIFAR10-LT benchmark immediately
witness a performance improvement (e.g., 0.28% increase on AUROC and 1.29% decrease on FPR95)
compared to the baseline OOD detector. However, the improvement is relatively insignificant, and
the phenomenon is consistent with our ablation studies in Tab. 4, which demonstrates the importance
of learning a class-dependent and input-dependent γy(x) during training.

Then, inspired by the statistical results in Fig. 2, we take a further step to use a polynomial (rank=2)
to fit the curve between the predicted class y and γy(x) learned by another model, and apply the
coefficients to estimate a class-dependent ˆγy for the baseline model (denoted as ˆβ(x)P(i|x)). This
operation receives further enhancement on OOD detection and gets close to our learned model (e.g.,
30.80% v.s. 29.95% of FPR95).

In conclusion, our attempts illustrate the potential of applying our method to an existing model
without post-training, and we will continue to extend ˆγy to an input-dependent version (say ˆγy(x)) in
our future work.

Conclusion and Discussion

This paper establishes a statistical framework ImOOD to formulate OOD detection on imbalanced
data distribution. Through theoretical analysis, we find there exists a class-aware biased item between
balanced and imbalanced OOD detection models. Based on it, our ImOOD provides a unified training-
time regularization technique to alleviate the imbalance problem. On three popular imbalanced OOD
detection benchmarks, extensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the validity and
versatility of our method. We hope our work can inspire new research in this community.

Limitations. Following the literature, ImOOD utilizes auxiliary OOD training samples to refine the
the ID/OOD decision boundary. However, unforeseen OOD samples in real-world applications could
potentially challenge this boundary. To mitigate this issue, integrating online-learning strategies for
adaptive decision-making during testing is a promising avenue. We view this as our future work.

Theorem Proofs

A.1
Proof for Lemma 3.1

From Bayesian Theorem, we have:

P(y|x) = P(x|y) · P(y)

P(x)
(A1)

In class-balanced scenarios, the class prior P bal(y) equals
1
K , where K is the class number. The
balanced classification posterior is given by:

P bal(y|x) = P bal(x|y) · 1

K
P bal(x)
(A2)

where the marginal probability P bal(x) ≡P(x) is independent from balanced or imbalanced class
distribution. Combining with Eq. (A1) and Eq. (A2), we have:

P bal(y|x) = P bal(x|y)

P(x|y) · 1

K · P(y|vx)

P(y)
≜γy(x) · P(y|vx)

P(y)
(A3)

where γy(x) = 1

K
P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) captures the likelihood difference for the same sample x between balanced
and imbalanced distributions.

A.2
Discussion for Lemma 3.1 and Statistic Results in Fig. 2

According to Fig. 2 that depicts the statistical distribution on the CIFAR10-LT benchmark, γy(x) is
higher for the ID sample from head classes than tail classes. This phenomenon is consistent with
γy(x) =
1
K
P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) . As the model has seen sufficient training examples for head classes, the data

likelihood P(x|yh) is approaching the balanced situation of P bal(x|y), the fraction of P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) is
closed to 1. Meanwhile, since a large number of tail samples are not presented during training, the
sample space is narrowed down and the data likelihood P(x|y) for tail classes is over-estimated
(even higher than P bal(x|y)), leading to a lower fraction of P bal(x|y)

P (x|y) . Therefore, γy(x) = 1

K
P bal(x|y)

P (x|y)
presents higher values for head classes than tail classes. The statistical results are well-aligned with
the theoretical analysis.

A.3
Derivation for Eq. (6)

Substituting the sigmoid function σ(z) =
1
1+e−z into Eq. (5), we have:

1
1 + e−gbal(x) = β(x) ·
1
1 + e−g(x)
(A4)

Consequently, we have:

e−g(x) = β(x) · e−gbal(x) + β(x) −1
(A5)

And then:

g(x) = −log β(x) · e−gbal(x) + β(x) −1

= −log e−gbal(x) h
1 + (β(x) −1) · egbal(x)i

= gbal(x) −log

(β(x) −1) · egbal(x) + 1

Experimental Settings and Implementations

B.1
Training Settings

For a fair comparison, we mainly follow PASCL’s [51] settings. On CIFAR10/100-LT benchmarks,
we train ResNet18 [18] for 200 epochs using Adam optimizer, with a batch size of 256. The initial
learning rate is 0.001, which is decayed to 0 using a cosine annealing scheduler. The weight decay
is 5 × 10−4. On the ImageNet-LT benchmark, we train ResNet50 [18] for 100 epochs with SGD
optimizer with the momentum of 0.9. The batch size is 256. The initial learning rate is 0.1, which is
decayed by a factor of 10 at epochs 60 and 80. The weight decay is 5 × 10−5. During training, each
batch contains an equal number of ID and OOD data samples (i.e., 256 ID samples and 256 OOD
samples). We use 2 NVIDIA V100-32G GPUs in all our experiments.

For a better performance, one may carefully tune the hyper-parameters to train the models.

B.2
Implementation Details

In the manuscript, we proposed a generalized statistical framework to formularize and alleviate the
imbalanced OOD detection problem. This section provides more details on implementing different
OOD detectors into a unified formulation, e.g., a binary ID/OOD classifier [5]:

• For BinDisc [5], we simply append an extra ID/OOD output node to the classifier layer of a
standard ResNet model, where ID classifier f and OOD detector g share the same feature
extractor. Then we adopt the sigmoid function to convert the logit g(x) into the ID/OOD
probability ˆp(i|x) =
1
1+e−g(x) .

• For Energy [32], following Du et al. [14], we first compute the negative free-energy
E(x; f) = log P

y efy(x), and then attach an extra linear layer to calculate the ID/OOD
logit g(x) = w · E(x; f) + b, where w, b are learnable scalars. Hence, the sigmoid function
is able to convert the logit g(x) into the probability ˆp(i|x).
• For OE [20], similarly, we compute the maximum softmax-probability MSP(x; f) =
maxy
efy(x)
P

y′ e
fy′ (x) , and use another linear layer to obtain the ID/OOD logit g(x) = w ·

MSP(x; f) + b.
• For Mahalanobis distance [24], we maintain an online feature-pool for each ID class y, so as
to calculate the Mahalanobis distances for the test samples as Dm(x). Then, an extra linear
layer is adopted to transform the distances to ID/OOD logits as g(x) = w · Dm(x) + b.

By doing so, one can exploit the unified training-time regularization in Sec. 3.3 to derive a strong
OOD detector.

Additional Experimental Results

C.1
Additional Error Statistics

In this section, we present the class-aware error statistics for OOD detection on different benchmarks
(see Fig. A1) and different detectors (see Fig. A2). For each OOD detector on each benchmark, we
first compute the OOD scores g(x) for all the ID and OOD test data. Then, a threshold λ is determined
to ensure a high fraction of OOD data (i.e., 95%) is correctly detected as out-of-distribution. Recall
that g(x) indicates the in-distribution probability for a given sample (i.e., P(i|x)). Finally, we
statistic the distributions of wrongly detected ID/OOD samples.

Specifically, in Fig. A1 and Fig. A2, the first row displays class labels of ID samples that are wrongly
detected as OOD (i.e., g(x) < λ), and the second row exhibits class predictions of OOD samples
that are wrongly detected as ID (i.e., g(x) > λ). In each subplot, we statistic the distribution over
head, middle, and tail classes (the division rule follows Wang et al. [51]) for simplicity. Note that the
total count of wrong OOD samples (in the second row) is constant, and a better OOD detector g will
receive fewer wrong ID samples (in the first row).

Fig. A1 compares our method with PASCL [51] on CIFAR10/100-LT and ImageNet-LT benchmarks.
The results indicate our method (dashed bar) performs relatively more balanced OOD detection on

16


---Page Break---
all benchmarks. We reduce the error number of ID samples from tail classes, and simultaneously
decrease the error number of OOD samples that are predicted as head classes. In particular, our
method achieves considerable balanced OOD detection on ImageNet-LT (the right column), which
brings a significant performance improvement, as discussed in Sec. 4.2.

Fig. A2 compares our integrated version and vanilla OOD detectors (i.e., OE, Energy, and BinDisc)
on the CIFAR10-LT benchmark. Similarly, the results indicate our method performs relatively more
balanced OOD detection against all original detectors. The versatility of our ImOOD framework is
validated, as discussed in Sec. 4.3.

However, the statistics in Fig. A1 and Fig. A2 indicate the imbalanced problem has not been fully
solved, since the scarce training samples of tail classes still affect the data-driven learning process.
More data-level re-balancing techniques may be leveraged to further address this issue.

Detailed Results on CIFAR10/100-LT Benchmarks

For CIFAR10/100-LT benchmark, Textures [11], SVHN [43], CIFAR100/10 (respectively), TinyIma-
geNet [27], LSUN [58], and Places365 [59] from SC-OOD dataset [56] are adopted as OOD test sets.
The mean results on the six OOD sets are reported in Sec. 4.

In this section, we reported the detailed measures on those OOD test sets in Tab. A1 and Tab. A2, as the
supplementary to Tab. 1. The results indicate our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
PASCL [51] on most of the subsets.

Comparison on Different Imbalance Ratios

In our manuscript, we mainly take the default imbalance ratio (ρ = 100), which means the least
frequent (tail) class only has
1
100 of training samples than the most frequent (head) class). Here,
we follow PASCL [51] to investigate another imbalance ratio of ρ = 50 (relatively more balanced
than ρ = 100) on CIFAR10-LT. According to Tab. A3, our method consistently surpasses PASCL
on various imbalance levels, and gains a larger enhancement (e.g., near 2.0% of AUROC) on the
more imbalanced scenario with ρ = 100, which further demonstrates our effectiveness in mitigating
imbalanced OOD detection.

Investigation on SOTA General OOD Detection Methods

Besides the method specifically designed for imbalanced OOD detection, we also compare with
several recently published detectors that aims at general (or, balanced) OOD detection:

• NECO [2] studies the neural collapse phenomenon develops a novel post-hoc method to leverage
geometric properties and principal component spaces to identify OOD data.
• fDBD [31] investigates model’s decision boundaries and proposes to detect OOD using the
feature distance to decision boundaries.
• IDLabel [15] theoretically delineates the impact of ID labels on OOD detection, and utilizes
ID labels to enhance OOD detection via representation characterizations through spectral
decomposition on the graph.
• ID-like [3] leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to identify challenging OOD
samples/categories from the vicinity space of the ID classes to further facilitate OOD detection.

The experimental results are displayed in Tab. A4. On the CIFAR10-LT benchmark, our method
surpasses the recent OOD detectors by a large margin. For imbalanced data distribution, IDLabel [15]
struggles to capture the distributional difference across ID classes, while the pure post-hoc methods
NECO [2] and fDBD [31] even get worse results because they fail to generalize to the scenario with
highly skewed feature spaces and decision boundaries. On the ImageNet-LT benchmark, even the

18


---Page Break---
incorporation of the powerful CLIP model cannot well address the imbalance problem for ID-like [3],
while our method can specifically and effectively facilitate imbalanced OOD detection with the help
of our theoretical groundness.

Additional Analysis on Correctly-detected ID and OOD Samples

In Fig. 1a, we reveal that the class labels for wrongly-identified ID samples and the class predictions
for wrongly-detected OOD samples are both sensitive the to the ID class distribution prior. Here,
Fig. A3 indicates the correctly-detected ID and OOD samples are insensitive to the class distribution.

Figure A3: Statistics on correctly-detected ID and OOD samples.

In particular, the per-class prediction quantity of correctly-detected OOD samples in Fig. A3 may
not precisely describe the statistical distribution, as the maximum ID-class prediction probability is
relatively low (e.g., maxyP(y|x, i) = 0.12 for 10-category classification) and introduce extra noise.
Therefore, we supplement the statistics of per-class prediction probability in Tab. A5, and all of the
distributions for OE, Energy, and PASCL are nearly even.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We accurately made the claims to reflect the paper’s contributions and scope
in Sec. 1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the limitation of our work in Sec. 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: Please refer to Sec. 3.2 and Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the experimental details in Sec. 4 and Appendix B.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/imood.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Sec. 4 and Appendix B.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to Appendix C.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We reported the compute resource requirements in Appendix B.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
Learning. There are many potential societal consequences that have been discussed in
previous works, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please follow the LICENSE in https://github.com/alibaba/imood.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All our experimental data and models are open source and obtainable.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please refer to https://github.com/alibaba/imood.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
