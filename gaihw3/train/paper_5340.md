Abstract

Inverse rendering methods have achieved remarkable performance in reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D objects with disentangled geometries, materials, and environmental
light. However, they still face huge challenges in reflective surface reconstruction.
Although recent methods model the light trace to learn specularity, the ignorance
of indirect illumination makes it hard to handle inter-reflections among multiple
smooth objects. In this work, we propose Ref-MC2 that introduces the multi-
times Monte Carlo sampling which comprehensively computes the environmental
illumination and meanwhile considers the reflective light from object surfaces. To
address the computation challenge as the times of Monte Carlo sampling grow,
we propose a specularity-adaptive sampling strategy, significantly reducing the
computational complexity. Besides the computational resource, higher geometry
accuracy is also required because geometric errors accumulate multiple times.
Therefore, we further introduce a reflection-aware surface model to initialize the
geometry and refine it during inverse rendering. We construct a challenging dataset
containing scenes with multiple objects and inter-reflections. Experiments show
that our method outperforms other inverse rendering methods on various object
groups. We also show downstream applications, e.g., relighting and material
editing, to illustrate the disentanglement ability of our method. Our project page:

Introduction

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [26] and 3DGS [16] have demonstrated their excellent performance
on novel view synthesis. However, it is difficult to directly apply their reconstructed 3D model to the
current industrial pipeline, leading to the lack of flexibility in many downstream applications, e.g.,
relighting and material editing. To better cooperate with mature techniques, inverse rendering bases
the physical rendering [24] and utilizes the neural network to learn disentangled materials that can be
seamlessly plunged into the industrial pipeline for further manipulation.

Previous methods [28, 9, 45, 57] have explored how to disentangle geometry, diffuse, roughness,
metalness, and environmental light from multi-view images, but they still face challenges in shading
and reflective objects. Specifically, Nvdiffrec [28] proposes a differentiable pipeline that enables
gradient-based optimization on both meshes and volumetric textures. These methods ignore the
shadow when modeling the illumination, resulting in failed disentanglement for diffuse and shading
appearances. To model more realistic shadings, Nvdiffrecmc [9] further incorporates ray tracing
and Monte Carlo sampling [27] into inverse rendering, significantly improving the decomposition
of shape, materials, and lighting. However, it ignores the indirect illuminations during path tracing

and treats rays attacking object surfaces as sheltered illumination. As a consequence, methods like
Nvdiffrecmc increase the ambiguity of geometry reconstruction and undermine material learning.
Unfortunately, the scene with multiple inter-reflections is common in the real world. The failure
in these scenes hinders the wider applications of these methods. Recent methods [17, 40, 22] take
inter-reflections into account and can reconstruct the reflective objects well. However, the implicit
representations of these methods for materials and renders sacrifice their scalability to downstream
tasks. Recently, Nefii [45] further incorporated the implicit neural radiance to estimate ray tracing,
alleviating the ambiguity between materials and indirect illuminations. However, this leads to a huge
computational consumption for path tracing. Neural Microfacet Fields [22] employs two-bounce
sampling for indirect light modeling, but its geometry field limits flexibility for downstream tasks.

In this paper, we proposed a full inverse rendering method, Ref-MC2, which considers inter-reflections
during ray tracing to improve the decomposition of explicit materials and environmental lighting. The
core of our method is to use Multi-times Monte Carlo integration [27] and BRDF [24] rendering
to approximate the indirect illumination at multiple reflection points along the light propagation
path. Although our method takes advantage of hardware-accelerated ray tracing to model the indirect
illumination, we still face two major challenges brought by the multi-times Monte Carlo sampling. 1)
Efficiency: the explosive computational growth from multiple times is too heavy for the hardware
algorithm only. 2) Geometry: the geometry quality greatly affects the calculation of indirect light
and the decomposition of the materials, because the error will accumulate over and over again as the
times of Monte Carlo sampling increase.

To address these challenges, we correspondingly propose two strategies. 1) For efficiency, we flatten
the multi-times sampling into sequential single-time sampling. In a Lambert model [31], the diffuse
light is independent of the direction of reflection and thus can be presented as a map to query at any
time. When we trace the indirect light from an object, instead of recalculating the diffuse component,
we can take the value directly from the diffuse map. It can be optimized through self-supervision.
Therefore, we only need to sample the specular component within a small lobe along around the
reflective direction. 2) For geometry, we refer to the SDF-based methods [41, 17, 6] and replace the
common positional encoding with the Sphere Gaussian encoding to get an accurate initial geometry
for reflective objects. We use this geometry to initialize Flxicubes [35] that optimizes surface
meshes based on the gradient, and further fine-tunes the Flexicubes in a differentiable pipeline. To
evaluate our framework, we construct a dataset containing difficult scenes which contain strong
inter-reflections between multiple surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
can successfully decompose indirect illumination and materials. In summary, our contributions are:

• We propose a full inverse rendering method that employs multi-times Monte Carlo sampling to
correctly decompose indirect illumination and materials.
• We reduce the computational consumption when tracing indirect illumination by self-
supervising the diffuse map based on the Lambert model.
• We refine the SDF-based architecture with Spherical Gaussian encoding to obtain a high-quality
initial geometry which further releases the accumulated error during multi-times sampling.
• We construct a dataset to evaluate the performance on indirect illumination.

Implicit Neural Representations

Neural implicit representations [23, 26, 32, 55, 44, 34, 10, 3, 4, 58, 36, 7] have achieved impressive
success in many computer vision and computer graphics tasks. These methods use neural radiance
fields to capture color and volume density, generating photo-realistic novel views through volume
rendering [15]. However, the unconstrained volumetric representation of the original NeRF method
leads to low-quality geometry. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [16, 11, 12, 20, 53] has
gained popularity in novel view synthesis. Different from NeRF, it is an explicit representation that
involves the optimization of multiple Gaussians to reconstruct 3D objects. 3DGS learns color and
density in a volumetric point cloud, but it also fails to produce accurate geometry due to its discrete
representation. Besides, these methods are all entangled learning, integrating all inherent materials
and the environment map into the appearance. This limits the downstream applications in the current
industrial pipeline. To produce a high-quality geometry, follow-up works [48, 43, 51, 30] use a

2


---Page Break---
function to associate signed distance field (SDF) and volume density. The surface mesh can be
extracted from neural implicit surfaces by Marching Cubes [19], and this 3D asset can be further
applied in other applications. However, they usually perform badly in reconstructing the reflective
objects due to the ambiguity of reflective appearance.

2.2
Neural Inverse Rendering

Although neural implicit surfaces have achieved impressive performance in geometry reconstructing
and novel views synthesis, they do not obtain the fundamental materials of PBR which limits their
flexibility in downstream tasks. Neural inverse rendering methods [17, 46, 8, 2, 54, 57, 13, 38,
21] introduce the physical rendering equation to estimate the disentangled diffuse and specular
component from RGB images. They approximate the rendering equation based on neural networks
or basis functions, e.g., Spherical Gaussians [42, 47, 49, 54] and Spherical Harmonics [5, 1, 37,
52]. Nvdiffrec [28] introduces the full inverse rendering that estimates shape, materials, and
environmental light into gradient-based optimization. However, it does not consider the shadows,
leading to the entanglement of materials. Recent works [6, 41] extend SDF-based architectures with
an additional appearance branch to model the reflections on the object. RefNeuS [6] introduces a
reparametrization method to distinguish the reflective appearance from the diffuse appearance by a
direction-relative process, but it fails to faithfully reconstruct non-reflective objects. UniSDF [41]
proposes to use a weight-MLP to balance the reflective and non-reflective branches for different
objects. However, these methods still face challenges in scenes with complex inter-reflections.
Nvdiffrecmc [9] extends Nvdiffrec with Monte Carlo sampling to trace the light path but still ignores
indirect illumination between objects. Further methods [17, 18, 45] consider indirect illumination in
their design. ENVIDR [17] employs a neural renderer to learn the physical light interaction, without
explicitly formulating the rendering equation. NeRO [18] applies the split-sum approximation to
approximate the shading effects of both direct and indirect lights. Nefii [45] introduces ray tracing to
the radiance field to model indirect illuminations. Neural Microfacet Fields [22] employs two-bounce
sampling to accurately calculate indirect illumination. However, NMF represents geometry by a
density field, which limits the scalability and flexibility for downstream tasks. In addition, these
aforementioned methods do not fully disentangle the materials from RGB images, but decompose
the appearance into reflective and diffuse color. It is hard to apply to the current industrial pipeline
directly.eq: rendering equation In contrast, our Ref-MC2 is a full inverse rendering method that also
considers indirect illumination.

Preliminaries

The rendering equation [14] is commonly used to compute the outgoing radiance Lo(p, ωo) from the
point p in outgoing direction ωo:

Lo (p, ωo) =
Z

Ω
Li (p, ωi) f (p, ωi, ωo) (n · ωi) dωi,
(1)

where Li(p, ωi) is the incoming radiance into p from the direction ωi, n is the normal of the point p,
Ωis the hemisphere of directions above p, f(p, ωi, ωo) is the BSDF evaluated for ωi and the current
incoming direction ωi. The GGX [24] physics-based BSDF function is proposed to decompose the
function into several physical terms. The function is described as:

f (p, ωi, ωo) = fd + fs = fd +
DFG
4 (n · ωi) (n · ωo),
(2)

where fd is the diffuse term and fs is the specular term. D, F, and G are the microfacet distribution
function, the Fresnel reflection coefficient, and the geometric attenuation, respectively.

Previous works [28] use the split sum function [25] to approximate the rendering equation, but it
inevitably omits the shadow and indirect illumination. In contrast, Monte Carlo integration [27] is a
simple but unbiased estimation method that comprehensively considers all the physical terms for the
outgoing radiance. The Monte Carlo integration rendering equation is:

Figure 1: We perform Monte Carlo sampling at the viewpoint. When the sampling ray from the point
is not blocked, it is the direct illumination from environmental lighting. When the sampling ray hits
an object, we divide this indirect illumination from the object into diffuse light and specular light. We
sample the diffuse light from a diffuse map that is optimized through self-supervision. For specular
light, we only need to partially trace the rays in a small specular lobe along the reflective direction.
The gradients are backward along the tracing path, and are passed to optimize kd, korm, normals,
and environment maps.

where ωi is the ith sample drawn from density p. As the number of samples grows, the estimation
variance reduces, but the computation increases. Multiple importance sampling [39] (MIS) is proposed
to inhibit the computational consumption. When a function can be expressed as a multiplication of n
functions, it draws ni samples ωi,j from n sampling distributions pi in turn. The MIS Monte Carlo
estimator for the rendering equation is:

3.2
Multi-times Monte Carlo Sampling

As discussed in Sec. 3.1, the split sum approximation ignores the shadows and the indirect illumina-
tion. Nvdiffrecmc notes this and accounts for shadows using the Monte Carlo integration method.
However, they give up continuously tracing the light rays attacking the surface of objects and treat
them as zero illumination. It leads to bad performance in scenes with inter-reflections. Therefore, we
propose the Ref-MC2 method to trace the light rays continuously. When taking into account indirect
illumination, based on [14], the rendering equation can be expressed in this version:

Lo (p, ωo) =
Z

Ω
Li (r (p, ωi) , −ωi) f (p, ωi, ωo) (n · ωi) dωi.
(5)

In this equation, r (p, ωi) represents the location of a surface point on the object surface hit by a
ray cast from p in direction ωi for the first time. The corresponding Monte Carlo integration that
considers the indirect illumination can then be expressed as:

Lo (p, ωo) ≈1

N

N
X

i=1

Li (r (p, ωi) , −ωi) f (p, ωi, ωo) (ωi · n)

p (ωi)
.
(6)

It can be interpreted as that when the sampling ray is not blocked, it can be seen as direct illumination
from environmental lighting. When the surface point of an object blocks the sampling ray, it needs to
be continuously traced from this surface point. This continuous tracing is an iterated process of Monte
Carlo integration. It is noteworthy that when continuous sampling at the blocking surface point it is

unnecessary to consider the indirect illumination like calculating the outgoing radiance at initial point
p. This is because the energy of light gradually degrades and the impact of light after twice reflections
is negligible compared to the explosively increased computational load. However, the additional
computational load of ray tracing at a depth of two is still huge. To reduce our computational load,
we further propose to approximate the diffuse light and transfer the computations.

In Disney PBR equation [24], the diffuse term fd is:

fd = cdiff

π


1 + (FD90 −1) (1 −(n · ωi))5 
1 + (FD90 −1) (1 −(n · ωo))5
,
(7)

FD90 = 0.5 + 2r cos2 θd,
(8)
where cdiff is the diffuse albedo of the material. In this equation, f is related to the direction of the
incoming radiance, which can yield more realistic results. However, using this equation to calculate
the diffuse light for indirect illumination creates unnecessary extra computation. Because the term fd
is related to the normal n and the direction of rays ωo, we cannot get the diffuse map before deep ray
tracing. The following term is to introduce the roughness for diffuse light to avoid too dark edges in
extremely low grazing angles. However, using this equation to compute the diffuse light for indirect
illumination introduces unnecessary extra computation. To reduce the burden, we can follow H and
approximate it using Lambertian diffuse lighting.:

f ind
d
= cdiff

π .
(9)

Where f ind
d
is the diffuse light of the indirect illumination. In this approximation, f ind
d
is independent
on the incoming direction ωi and the outgoing direction ωo. Based on this, the diffuse part of indirect
light can be simplified as:

Lind
diff (p) = cdiff

π

Z

Ω
Li (p, ωi) (n · ωi) dωi,
(10)

where Lind
diff is the diffuse part of the indirect illumination. It no longer relates to the direction of the
sampling ray, so we can present it via an MLP M. Compared to the diffuse part, the specular part is
strongly related to the ray direction. It is a disadvantage that we cannot approximate the specular part
like the diffuse part, but it is also an advantage that we only need to sample minor rays in a small
specular lobe along the reflective directions. Therefore, we significantly reduce the computations of
both the diffuse part and the specular part during the multi-times Monte Carlo Sampling.

3.3
Geometry Initialization

As seen in the equation 5, our indirect lighting highly depends on the geometry. However, the strong
ambiguity of reflections makes it hard to directly learn high-quality disentangled shapes. Therefore,
we flatten the joint learning process of both geometry and materials into separate learning of them
and thus reduce the number of physical terms to be disentangled in each learning stage.

We first utilize SDF-based architectures [48, 6, 18] to learn an initial geometry. The two branches of
the diffuse and reflective networks well disambiguate the appearance with reflections and empower the

5


---Page Break---
SDF network to produce a high-quality geometry, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). However, this architecture
encounters challenges of indirect illumination due to the expressive capacity of Integrated Positional
Encoding (IPE). It performs well in general scenes but shows limitations in representing inter-
reflections. Due to the capacity of Spheical Gaussians (SG) [50, 33] to represent radiance directions,
we introduce SG encoding instead of IPE to enhance the expressive capacity of reflective MLP, as
shown in Fig. 2 (b). Besides, we directly parameterize diffuse appearance as SG coefficients which is
suitable for objects with multiple reflective surfaces. The geometry comparison is shown in Fig. 2.

The learned SDF can be then converted into a surface mesh using the Marching Cubes [19], which
supports further tuning in the following inverse rendering pipeline. Different from Nvdiffrecmc
which adopts DMTET for differentiable mesh optimization, we introduce Flexicubes [35] into our
inverse rendering pipeline. Flexicubes use the SDF, weight, and the deformation for vertexes of the
grid cells to extract the surface mesh using the DMC [29]. The mesh is converted into a differentiable
representation that can be optimized based on gradients.

3.4
Training Objectives

The main objective is to minimize the photometric loss between rendered images and ground truth:

Lrgb = ||C −Cgt||2,
(11)

where C is the rendering result, and Cgt is the corresponding ground truth. Following previous
work [56, 28, 9], we adopt a smoothness loss for diffuse and material as regularization:

Ld =
X

xsurf
|kd (xsurf ) −kd (xsurf + ϵ)| ,
(12)

Lorm =
X

xsurf
|korm (xsurf ) −korm (xsurf + ϵ)| ,
(13)

where xsurf represents the world coordinates of points on the object’s surface.
kd(xsurf ) and
korm(xsurf ) is the material of this point. ϵ is a randomly distributed vector of tiny deformations. A
self-supervised loss is used to regulate the learned diffuse color:

Ldiff = Lrgb (Cdiff, kdiff (xsurf)) ,
(14)

where Cdiff is the diffuse light from the object surface obtained during rendering. kdiff(xsurf) is the
diffuse light obtained by the MLP. Overall, the full loss function is:

L = Lrgb + ω1Ld + ω2Lorm + ω3Ldiff,
(15)

where ω1, ω2 and ω3 are three predefined scalars.

Experiments

4.1
Implementation Details

Dataset. We construct a dataset of multiple reflective objects based on the existing single objects to
evaluate the performance. Our dataset consists of 16 groups of object compositions, most of which
contain indirect illumination between reflective objects. We render the composed objects with various
environmental lighting in the Blender engine. Each group contains 300 images, with 200 for the
training set and 100 for the test set.

Experiment setup. We optimize the 3D model on 1 RTX 3090 GPU with 24G memory. We use the
Adam optimizer for the material and the environment map with an initial learning rate of 0.03. The
coefficients of loss function ω1, ω2, and ω3 are set to 0.1, 0.05, and 1, respectively. The rate of Monte
Carlo sampling is commonly set to 128 consistent with the setting in Nvdiffrecmc [9].

4.2
Comparison with Baseline

In this section, we compare our method with Nvdiffrec [28], Nvdiffrecmc [9], and Nefii [45] on our
constructed reflective dataset, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Nvdiffrec achieves photo-realistic
results in the metal balls but fails on the smooth and glossy table + horse. Besides, Nvdiffrec cannot

performs well in material learning, while its rendering results are bad. These two methods also suffer
from indirect illumination from the reflection of inner objects, leading to low-quality environment
maps. Nefii is the recent work that considers the indirect illumination in the radiance field, but it tends
to produce low-reflective results and performs badly in these high specular objects. Compared to
these methods, our method can achieve both photo-realistic rendering results and well-disentangled
material learning. We can handle highly specular objects, e.g., the metal table. The environment
maps learned by our methods are also superior to others.

results with depth=1 show fewer and darker reflections compared to the ground truth. kd maps also

mistaking the diffuse color of the table as the color of the sky. In contrast, with depth=2 or 3, results
show more realistic renderings and disentangled materials.

Multi-times Monte Carlo Sampling

In this section, we conduct an ablation study on the times of Monte Carlo Sampling, i.e.the depth
of ray tracing. Multi-times sampling considers the indirect illumination, and thus successfully
disentangles the environment light and inner reflective light. As shown in Fig. 4, the environment

8


---Page Break---
maps learned by single-time sampling contain noise and shades that are actually the inner reflection.
In contrast, multi-times sampling significantly releases the problem, producing a clearer environment
map. Single-time sampling also undermines the rendering results, with darker inverted reflections.
When the sampling ray is sheltered by objects during path tracing, the ray returns no light, resulting
in a dark point. Multi-times sampling returns the reflective light of the sheltering points containing
both diffuse and specular light. As a consequence, the rendering results of multi-times sampling show
realistic appearance and reflections. Besides, it can be seen that results with 2-time sampling are
comparable to results with 3-time sampling. Tab. 1 also quantitatively shows minimal improvement
by deeper tracing. However, each additional sampling time induces a 4-times computation increment.
Therefore, a 2-times sampling is a more cost-effective setting. Additionally, we also compare the
efficiency between the sampling with and without acceleration. As shown in Tab. 1, our method can
make the training speed twice as fast while keeping a comparable PSNR. The degree of acceleration
is related to the complexity of geometry, and here we adopt the median in our dataset.

4.4
Geometry

In this section, we further explore the necessity of the initial geometry discussed in Sec. 3.3 and
present our geometry reconstruction results. As shown in Fig. 5, without initial geometry, the
rendering results show bumpy surfaces with badly learned materials in the area of hollow shape.
Because multi-times sampling amplifies the errors introduced by geometry, the learned materials
are even worse than the single-time sampling. When applying a good-quality initialization, the
network bypasses the ambiguity brought by the geometry. It helps our method learn well-disentangled
materials and finally produces high-quality rendering results. Quantitative comparison in Tab. 1
also demonstrate the necessity of geometry initialization. In addition, we showcase a real-scene
geometry reconstruction result of the NeRO [18] dataset in Fig. 6. We further use Chamfer Distance
to quantitatively evaluate our geometric quality and present the results in Tab. 2.

Figure 6: Real scene geometry comparison. We compare our reconstructed geometry with NeRO,
Nvdiffrec and Nvdiffrecmc. Our reconstructed geometry demonstrates superior results.

Relighting and Material Editing

The disentangled environment map and material empower our methods to relight and edit recon-
structed objects in the downstream application. Our method can also be seamlessly plugged into the
industrial pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7, our method enables the arbitrary combination of reconstructed
objects. We can easily edit their metalness, roughness, and albedo color by manipulating the learned
materials. Due to the well-disentangled shading, our rendering results are natural and realistic in
all five environment maps, even the point light in a dark environment. They also perform well
after editing materials thanks to the well-learned material map. For example, after we increase the
metalness and reduce the roughness of the teapot, the teapot clearly reflects the neighboring objects
on its surface. In another case, where we extremely increase the reflectance and change the base color
of the toaster, it accomplishes to reflect the scene and other objects. To showcase further applications

of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets captured by NeRO [18] and present
the comparison results in Fig. 8. It can be seen that Ref-MC2 achieves more realistic results under
different lighting conditions.

Conclusion and Limitations

In conclusion, our Ref-MC2 introduces multi-times Monte Carlo sampling into the inverse rendering
pipeline to model the indirect illumination. It improves the performance in scenes with complex inter-
reflections. However, increment of sampling times significantly increases computational consumption
and makes the pipeline highly geometry-sensitive. To solve the challenge of computational efficiency,
based on the Lambert model, we simplify the BRDF for indirect lighting, which allows us to reduce
the number of ray traces. To improve the geometry quality, we adopt SDF-based architecture to get
an initial geometry and refine a design with Spherical Gaussian encoding for reflective objects. We
further use Flexicubes to take the initial mesh into the differentiable rendering pipeline that learns
disentangled materials. Our Ref-MC2 still has several limitations. The major limitation is that the
2-time sampling cannot handle extremely reflective objects, e.g., mirrors, as the specular energy
hardly degrades after reflections. Besides, the training time needs to further reduce in future time.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our abstract and introduction accurately reflect the contributions and scope.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed the limitations of the work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

14


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The data and code have not been provided to reviewers.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

15


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]
Justification: We will release the data and code in a few weeks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the implement details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Results are accompanied by error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

16


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report compute resources in the experiment set up.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conforms with that.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss them in the introduction and experiments.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

17


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited them.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed them in section experiment.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: NA.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
