Abstract

In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two pre-
dominant paradigms. Generative training has enabled Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to tackle various complex tasks, yet issues such as hallucina-
tions and weak object discrimination persist. Discriminative training, exemplified
by models like CLIP, excels in zero-shot image-text classification and retrieval,
yet struggles with complex scenarios requiring fine-grained semantic differentia-
tion. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a unified approach that
integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering interleaved image-text
sequences as the general format of input samples, we introduce a structure-induced
training strategy that imposes semantic relationships between input samples and
the MLLM’s hidden state. This approach enhances the MLLM’s ability to capture
global semantics and distinguish fine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic
sequence alignment within the Dynamic Time Warping framework and integrating
a novel kernel for fine-grained semantic differentiation, our method effectively
balances generative and discriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple
generative tasks, especially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities.
Additionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and
fine-grained retrieval tasks. By employing a retrieval-augmented generation strat-
egy, our approach further enhances performance in some generative tasks within
one model, offering a promising direction for future research in vision-language
modeling. The project repository is here.

Introduction

In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two predominant
paradigms: generative training and discriminative training. Generative Training has achieved
remarkable success in enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1, 55, 86] to develop
a wide range of powerful capabilities that can handle various complex tasks (e.g., open-world visual
question-answering, image caption generation, etc.) within a single model. However, challenges
such as hallucinations and weak image object discrimination abilities [7, 89] persist. Discriminative
Training, exemplified by CLIP [73], exhibits remarkable representation capabilities for zero-shot
image-text classification and retrieval. Nonetheless, it encounters difficulties in processing complex
scenarios (i.e., , retrieving multi-modal documents with interleaved images and texts) [53, 54] and
exhibits a limited ability to discern detailed semantic differences [79, 85].

The disparity between these two paradigms has sparked recent studies aimed at imparting discrim-
inative ability to generative pre-trained MLLMs. However, certain aspects of performance still
pose limitations (e.g., singular discriminative tasks [89], weak discriminative task performance [40],
weak generalization [59], etc.), while others entail compromising the model’s original generative
capabilities [8].

Overall, the reason generative paradigms struggle with performing discriminative tasks like retrieval
is due to overlooking two crucial abilities:

(i) Comprehensively capturing the global semantics. Recent studies have revealed that causal LLMs
tend to exhibit a bias towards capturing global information from the input samples, often resulting
in a tendency to overlook information located in the middle, especially for long sequences [15, 57].
As illustrated in Figure 1(a), we chose 500 samples from WebQA [10], where the task is to find
and reason about the right image-text pair among five distractors to produce a yes or no answer.
We conducted experiments using VILA [52], a MLLM with state-of-the-art interleaved image-text
comprehension ability, alongside our model. When placing the relevant pair in different positions,
the performance of MLLMs followed a ’U’ shape, indicating a bias in capturing global semantic
information. Consequently, MLLMs encounter difficulties in forming comprehensive representations
that encompass global semantics for retrieval tasks.

(ii) Keenly differentiating the detailed semantics. Some research [47, 82] has found that the
existing generative training framework cannot fully distinguish input semantics in certain contexts,
causing MLLMs to struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained semantics [46, 98]. As depicted in
Figure 1(b), we noticed that MLLMs face challenges in choosing the right description for two similar
images in the MMVP-VLM benchmark [81]. This indicates that MLLMs struggle to effectively
differentiate the detailed semantics of input samples, naturally leading to difficulties in forming
effective queries for retrieval.

Figure 1: (a) In WebQA [10], the accuracy roughly forms a “U” shape curve when the relevant
image-text pair for a question appears at different positions. While our model also shows similar
trends, it tends to be more stable overall. (b) The accuracy of various types of questions in MMVP-
VLM [81], it can be observed that our model’s performance improves on such tasks after introducing
the discriminative training. Details can be seen in Appendix E.3

In this paper, we argue that the current separated paradigms possess the potential for achieving syner-
gistic gains. We propose Sugar: Structure-induced approach to unify generative and discriminative
paradigms (shown in Figure 2), leveraging discriminative training to acquire the two abilities above
while harnessing the potential of generative training in complex discriminative tasks like image-text
interleaved retrieval and fine-grained retrieval. Specifically, we explicitly impose the semantic rela-
tionships between different input samples as an induced structural constraint on the hidden state of
MLLMs. We consider the interleaved image-text sequence as the general format of input samples, and
then formulate the relationship between any two samples as a dynamic sequence alignment problem
within the Dynamic Time Warping framework [67, 33]. In this way, we can explicitly modulate
the hidden states of the MLLM by leveraging the semantic relationships between interleaved input
sequences, thereby encouraging the MLLM to fully capture the global semantics of the inputs.

To further enhance the ability to differentiate fine-grained semantics, we integrate a novel kernel
into the Dynamic Time Warping framework. Leveraging the strengths of various discriminative
pre-trained models, it performs dynamic sequence alignment for diverse embeddings tailored to
specific contexts, thus addressing the inherent limitations in fully utilizing input semantics. Through
this explicit structure-induced constraint, our framework enables MLLMs to capture the global
semantics and fine-grained details of the input multimodal sequence more effectively, thus bridging
the gap between generative and discriminative training paradigms.

Figure 2: Our structure-induced generative and discriminative training joint training strategy.

Our method effectively balances both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrating synergistic
benefits. (i) Large-scale generative pre-trained models possess semantic-rich hidden states [41, 91,
23], which facilitate discriminative tasks like retrieval. Moreover, harnessing the capabilities of
MLLM is crucial for complex discriminative tasks, such as interleaved image-text retrieval and
fine-grained retrieval. (ii) By integrating discriminative tasks, the model’s effectiveness in generative
tasks, particularly within tasks requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities, is enhanced, thereby
mitigating certain occurrences of hallucinations. (iii) We can employ Sugar to realize retrieval-
augmented generation [2], eliminating the need for an off-the-shelf retrieval module [75], thereby
amplifying the performance of various generative tasks. The usage of off-the-shelf retrieval presents
a challenge wherein the retriever’s performance affects the generator’s final output [62]. This
necessitates independent optimization of both components, posing a dilemma in selecting optimal
configurations. However, our approach circumvents such optimization challenges.

Through extensive experimentation, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. For
generative tasks, Sugar establishes new state-of-the-art results on the tasks for complicated multi-
modal comprehension tasks (i.e., DEMON [47]), fine-grained semantic distinctions (i.e., VizWiz [28],
MME [95]), object hallucinations detection (i.e., POPE [51]) (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3). For
discriminative tasks, we achieved competitive results in image-text retrieval compared, and signifi-
cantly surpassed CLIP in interleaved retrieval and fine-grained retrieval (Section 4.4). Furthermore,
employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy led to further improvements in a series
of generative tasks (Section 4.5).

Related Work
Multi-modal Large Language Models. Flamingo [3] and BLIP-2 [49] integrate LLMs with
visual encoders, showcasing impressive zero-shot capabilities by aligning visual features with
language representations. Building upon the advancements of LLaVA-1.5 [55], subsequent stud-
ies [103, 19, 94, 6, 42, 72, 95, 98, 45] propose fine-tuning MLLMs with multimodal instruction
tuning data [102]. Recently, there has been a surge in research [52, 80, 22, 21, 48] dedicated to
enhancing the capacity of MLLMs to process interleaved image-text inputs effectively. However,
these models primarily focus on generative tasks, overlooking the importance of introducing discrimi-
native constraints. In this paper, we propose a structure-induced joint training strategy for unifying
generative and discriminative tasks, further enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs, especially those
requiring cognitive and discriminative abilities.

Vision-Language Pre-training. Vision-Language Pre-training primarily come in two forms: single-
stream and dual-stream. In single-stream models, the embeddings for the image and text modalities are
concatenated and jointly encoded [39, 50], while in dual-stream models, they are encoded by separate
modality-specific encoders with optional cross-modality fusion [73, 31, 5]. These models have shown
effectiveness in tasks such as classification and retrieval. However, they face challenges including
difficulty in processing complex composed sequences [53, 54] and limited ability to discern detailed
semantic differences [81, 79]. Recent attempts to utilize generative MLLMs for discriminative
tasks have faced limitations, such as singular discriminative tasks [89], weak discriminative task
performance [40], poor generalization [59], and compromised generative capabilities [8].

LLMs for Retrieval. Early models for retrieval primarily focused on word representations [16, 64,
74], with minimal generative capabilities. Some recent works have endeavored to fine-tune generative
pre-trained LLMs to generate discriminative embeddings, albeit at the expense of compromising the
model’s original generative capabilities [44, 70, 65, 63, 24, 71]. GRIT [66] integrates generative and
discriminative tasks in NLP and demonstrates mutual benefits between them. However, its training
cost is prohibitively high compared to individual tasks. Moreover, due to its specialized attention
mechanism, the model can only be trained from scratch.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)[25, 69], which har-
nesses the advanced inference capabilities of LLMs along with external knowledge, has the potential
to significantly mitigate issues related to long-tail entities and reduce the occurrence of hallucina-

tory responses [29, 36, 101, 77, 90, 92, 97]. Recently, there have also been related studies in the
multimodal domain attempting to utilize retrieval augmentation [93, 96]. These methods typically
require an additional retrieval module (e.g., CLIP), leading to component optimization challenges
where the overall model performance is affected by the performance of the retrieval model, as well
as concerns regarding the compatibility between the retrieval model and the MLLMs. Furthermore,
retrieval modules like CLIP struggle to handle compositional or fine-grained scenarios, posing certain
challenges for retrieval.

these alignments, we can obtain the similarity between two interleaved inputs for training. (b) Sugar
Framework. Sugar supports both multi-modal generation and retrieval simultaneously.

We view the interleaved image-text sequence as the general format for input samples, where im-
ages and textual data are alternately arranged. Typically, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) [55, 52, 11, 6] are tailored to generate text based on such input sequences, and it is
conventionally optimized using self-regressive loss Lg. A special scenario arises when the input
comprises only one image and a question, prompting the MLLMs to generate an answer accordingly.

While intuitive, this optimization objective solely supervises text generation and lacks constraints on
the hidden states of the entire interleaved sequence input. Additionally, the existing generative training
framework struggles to fully distinguish input semantics in certain contexts, such as discerning
fine-grained object details. Consequently, it fails to adequately capture the global information or
distinguish detailed semantics of the input samples.

Hence, we introduce a structure-induced constraint Ld (see in Figure 2), which explicitly imposes
the semantic relationships between different input samples as an induced structural constraint on the
hidden states of MLLMs, facilitating the model in capturing global semantics. We conceptualize
the derivation of semantic relationships between input samples as a Dynamic Sequence Alignment
problem [67]. Additionally, we straightforwardly select a token in the hidden state of the MLLM to
encompass all preceding input information, eliminating the need for training any specialized tokens.

To further effectively distinguish detailed semantics, we integrate a novel kernel into the Dynamic
Time Warping framework. Leveraging the strengths of various discriminative pre-trained models.
Combined with this newly proposed loss with a hyperparameter α, the training objective can be
formulated as:
L = Lg + αLd

Dynamic Sequence Alignment

We formulate the computation of relationships within input interleaved sequences as a dynamic
sequence alignment problem, and solve it by global alignment kernel. For two interleaved image-text
sequence, each consisting of n and m images/sentences in total respectively (which we’ll refer to as
slices later on). We encode and normalize each slice, resulting in two sequences x = (x1, . . . , xn) and

In our setting, X is simply Rd, d refers to the feature dimension. We define the global alignment
kernel as follows, and it has been proved to be positive-definite under mild conditions and may prove
more robust to quantify the similarity of two sequences [73, 68]:

is the distance between slice xπ1(i) and yπ2(i) for
an alignment (details for the definition of alignment can be seen in Appendix D.2).

Due to the causal attention mechanism, the token in hidden state of MLLM can encapsulate infor-
mation from preceding tokens in the sequence. Therefore, we directly utilize the last token di of a
sequence from the MLLM’s hidden state and map it to the ri using an MLP to represent the entire
in-context sequence. During training, we obtain a set of (r1, r2, . . . , rn) and their corresponding input
sequence embedding set (x1, x2, . . . , xn). It is noteworthy that ri and rj (xi and xj) may originate
from the same sequence but occupy different positions, thus enabling our method to utilize samples
more efficiently.

Leveraging the GAK, we can derive the similarity matrix of (r1, r2, . . . , rn) and (x1, x2, . . . , xn)
distinctively, denoted as Mr, Ml ∈Rn×n. For imposing the semantic relationships between different
input samples as an induced structural constraint on the hidden state of MLLMs, we employ Mean
Squared Error (MSE) loss aligned Mr with the label matrix Ml. This approach eliminates the
need for pre-defined label (i.e., positive and negative candidates) during training, allowing seamless
integration into the aforementioned training framework (for specific training templates, please refer
to Appendix E.1). Thus, we have the discriminative loss Ld:

Ld = 1

(3)

Additionally, when both x and y contain only one slice, the computed result of the formula is mono-
tonically increasing with the directly calculated cosine similarity (proof can be seen in Appendix 3).
Therefore, in such cases, we simplify the computation by directly using cosine similarity. If ri and rj
comes from the same input interleaved sample, we manually set ml
ij = 1.

3.3
Detailed Semantics Modeling

To further effectively distinguish detailed semantics, we further propose the Triple Kernel (TK), a
positive definite kernel compatible with the previous framework. The TK leverages representations
from diverse pre-trained discriminative models across uni-modal and cross-modal settings, harnessing
their respective strengths. The definition is as below:

For two slice a, b ∈Rd, meets (i) |a| = |b| = 2 , d = d1+d2, a = concat(a1, a2), b = concat(b1, b2),
a1, b1 ∈Rd1, a2, b2 ∈Rd2 and |a1| = |a2| = |b1| = |b2| = 1; or (ii) |a| = |b| = 1. We define tripe
kernel as follows:

φ(a, b) =






||a1 −b1||2
|a| = |b| = 2 and a, b in uni-modal
||a2 −b2||2
|a| = |b| = 2 and a, b in cross-modal
||a −b||2
else
(4)

We prove triple kernel φ is a conditionally positive-definite kernel defined on X × X →R (Ap-
pendix 2), aligning with the kernel definition in [18], thereby possessing its properties.

In practice, we let the feature dimension d = d1 + d2. For images, we employ DINOv2-base [68]
and CLIP ViT-L/14 [73] for encoding, then concatenate the embeddings after normalization. For
sentences, we utilize BGE-base [87] and CLIP ViT-L/14, keeping the dimension unchanged. By
utilizing the Triple Kernel, we can fully leverage the strengths of these three models, effectively
distinguishing detailed semantics.

Experiments

To assess Sugar’s generative ability, we conduct a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art
models on 11 commonly used visual-language benchmarks in Section 4.2. Furthermore, we evaluate
more complicated multimodal comprehension tasks on DEMON with 29 datasets in Section 4.3.
For discriminative tasks, we compare performance across three different retrieval tasks: image-text
retrieval, interleaved retrieval, and fine-grained retrieval in Section 4.4. Subsequently, we leverage
Sugar’s discriminative ability for retrieval-augmented generation compared with common used
retrieve module in Section 4.5. Finally, we conduct ablation experiments to analyze the effectiveness
of our method in Section 4.6.

4.1
Setup

We apply our method to VILA [52], a recent state-of-the-art MLLM supporting interleaved input.
We further fine-tune VILA using LoRA [30]. Details about the experiments setting, datasets and the
instruction examples, please check in Appendix E.

4.2
Multimodal Comprehension on 11 Benchmarks

We conduct a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art models on 11 commonly used bench-
marks, as shown in Table 1. Compared to existing models, Sugar achieves remarkable improvements
over the second-best performing model on tasks requiring fine-grained semantics (i.e., LLaVAWd [56],
VizWiz [28], SQA [61] improve by 8%, 4.5%, 1.8% respectively) and benchmarks for detecting
hallucinations (i.e., POPE [51]), while maintaining competitive results in other tasks. Notably, Sugar
excels in discriminative tasks and still achieves 5 state-of-the-art results and 3 second-best results on
11 benchmarks for generative tasks, even outperforming some models larger than 7B. Our results
demonstrate the benefits of incorporating the discriminative loss, aiding in fine-grained semantic
tasks and reducing hallucinations.

4.3
Complicated Multimodal Comprehension on DEMON

Table 2 demonstrates the superior performance of Sugar on the DEMON benchmark, which comprises
7 categories and a total of 29 sub-tasks. These tasks are considerably more complex than the previously
used 11 common benchmarks. DEMON is tailored to evaluate the capacity of models and systems to
understand demonstrative instructions that include multiple, interleaved, and multimodal contexts,
presenting the essential information needed to complete a task. Sugar surpasses the previous state-
of-the-art model on the DEMON benchmark, VPG-C [47], across 6 of 7 categories. For example,
we achieve performance improvements of 36.1% in Text-Rich Images QA (TRQA) tasks and 17.2%
in Visual Relation Inference (VRI) tasks, both of which require detailed semantics, compared to
the second-best performing model. This underscores our advanced ability to associate interleaved

text-image inputs for stronger in-context understanding, and Sugar’s strong capability to capture
global semantics in interleaved sequences, facilitated by joint training with discriminative loss.

4.4
Zero-shot Cross-modal Information Retrieval

Image-text Retrieval. We evaluated the performance of Sugar on the widely adopted MSCOCO [38]
dataset in the context of a standard image-text retrieval task. Sugar demonstrated comparable
performance to FROMAGe [40] in R@1 and surpassed it in R@5 and R@10, highlighting Sugar’s
superiority in normal retrieval tasks.

Interleaved Retrieval. To assess the proficiency of Sugar in processing multimodal contextual
information, we evaluated its performance in retrieving relevant images conditioned on sequences
of interleaved image-text inputs from the Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset [32]. We conducted
evaluations across several experimental configurations, following the same setup as FROMAGe [40]
(see Appendix F.1). Our results show that Sugar outperforms FROMAGe in most settings, particularly
achieving a 20.3% improvement in the 5c+4i configuration, significantly surpassing both CLIP and
BLIP-2. This demonstrates that our method effectively leverages MLLMs’ ability to handle complex
interleaved sequence inputs, thereby achieving superior retrieval performance.

Fine-grained Retrieval. We tested fine-grained retrieval using the Winoground dataset [79], which
evaluates the ability to perform vision-linguistic compositional reasoning. Surprisingly, Sugar
outperformed all discriminative pre-trained models (both single-stream and dual-stream encoder
architectures), achieving improvements of 5.3%, 77.1%, and 86.2% over the second-best model in
the Text, Image, and Group dimensions, respectively. This demonstrates Sugar’s strong capability to
distinguish detailed semantics and performing compositional reasoning.

4.5
Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Due to Sugar’s dual capabilities in both discrimination and generation, we can achieve retrieval
augmentation without the need for an additional retrieval module. For performing retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), we selected two tasks, namely VizWiz and SQAI, as they offer held-in data that
were not seen during model training. We utilized a mixed set comprising the widely-used LLaVA-1.5
SFT subset and the held-in datasets of the two tasks as the knowledge base and employed different

retrieval modules to retrieve relevant knowledge for the MLLM. The results are as follows: (i) We
observed a drop in performance for LLaVA-1.5 with RAG in all tasks. This may be because LLaVA
is designed solely for single-image input, without the ability to utilize in-context external knowledge.
(ii) Compared to VILA, Sugar’s performance improved in both tasks, whereas VILA improved in
SQAI but decreased in VizWiz. These findings suggest that Sugar’s retrieved knowledge is more
beneficial, while the knowledge retrieved by CLIP and BLIP-2 may hinder performance.

4.6
Ablations

Importance of Both Tasks. (1) w/o datag: As shown in Table 4, when we reduce the amount of
data for discriminative tasks (Row 2), there are performance drops of 1.5% in hallucination detection
tasks (i.e., POPE) and 4.2% in interleaved multi-modal comprehension tasks (i.e., KGQA). (2) w/o
datad: Similarly, reducing the data for generative tasks (Row 3), the performance on generative tasks
declines with a 10.1% decrease in VIST, which requires global semantics capturing, and a 4.1%
decrease in Winoground, which necessitates fine-grained semantic understanding. This indicates that
generative and discriminative training can mutually benefit each other.

Effectiveness of Individual Components. (1) w/o GAK: When we exclude the Global Alignment
Kernel (GAK) (Row 4) and resort to using the average similarity for the slices, a notable decrease in
performance is observed across several interleaved image-text tasks (i.e., a 5.1% decrease in KQGA
and a 28.3% decrease in VIST). This underscores the fundamental role of GAK in aiding Sugar to
capture global semantics effectively. (2) w/o TK: Upon removal of the Triple Kernel (TK) (Row
5) and utilization of CLIP for encoding the input sequence instead, a dramatic performance decline
is evident in Winoground, with a 43.5% decrease. This underscores the significant role of TK in
facilitating the distinction of detailed semantics. (3) w/o AvgPool: When solely using the last token
for retrieval, a general decline in performance is observed across discriminative tasks, with decreases
of 19.1% for MSCOCO, 22.6% for VIST, and 13.2% for Winoground. This phenomenon may be
attributed to the last token of an image often corresponding to a pooling token, containing relatively
weaker semantic information. Utilizing all image tokens and performing AvgPooling tends to yield
greater improvements in retrieval tasks.

Conclusion

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained using both generative and discriminative
paradigms, each with distinct advantages and limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Structure-
induced approach to unify generative and discriminative paradigms, which imposes semantic rela-
tionships between input samples, thereby enhancing the MLLM’s ability to capture global semantics
and distinguish fine-grained details. This approach effectively balances generative and discriminative
tasks, yielding synergistic benefits. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks, particularly those requiring
cognitive and discrimination abilities, while also demonstrating competitive performance in discrim-
inative tasks such as image-text retrieval and achieving state-of-the-art results in interleaved and
fine-grained retrieval. Furthermore, employing a retrieval-augmented generation strategy within a
single model leads to additional improvements, offering a promising direction for future research.

A
Broader Impact

The broader impact of Sugar, carries both potential benefits and risks upon deployment and release.
Some considerations are unique due to their visual nature, while others mirror existing instruction-
following Large Language Models (LLMs). Built upon Vicuna, CLIP, DINOv2, and BGE, Sugar
inherits issues associated with LLMs and vision encoders. Below, we outline risks and mitigation
strategies for its release.

Hallucination.
Similar to other MLLMs, Sugar may generate outputs detached from facts or input
data, posing concerns, especially in critical applications like medicine and the field related to security.

Biases.
Bias from base models can transfer to Sugar, originating from both the vision encoder (CLIP)
and the language decoder (Vicuna), potentially leading to biased outcomes or unfair representations.

Ethical Impacts.
This study doesn’t raise ethical concerns, as it doesn’t involve subjective assess-
ments or private data, only utilizing publicly available datasets.

Expected Societal Implications.
A significant societal concern lies in potential misuse, such as
fabricating unauthorized texts leading to misinformation, privacy breaches, and other damaging
consequences. Strong ethical standards and ongoing surveillance are essential for mitigation.

These issues aren’t unique to our method but are prevalent across different techniques for multi-
concept customization. Despite the risks, we believe the benefits outweigh the potential harm,
allowing ongoing investigation and improvement of the model while engaging the community in
developing better mitigation strategies. Moreover, its release can foster new applications and research
directions, contributing to the progress and responsible deployment of foundation models in vision-
language tasks.

B
Limitations

(i) Our method, while effective, may inherit limitations from the underlying models, such as halluci-
nation in generating outputs detached from facts or input data and potential biases originating from
the model we used. (ii) The training data might inevitably contain mismatched image and text, which
could adversely affect training.

C
Mathematical Proof

Theorem 1. The alignment kernel K can be computed in quadratic complexity, namely in O(mnd2)
iterations. where m, n denotes the length of two sequence and their hidden dimension all is d,
m, n, d ∈R.

Proof. Given x = (x1, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, . . . , ym) two sequences of X ⋆, we set the double-
subscripted series Mi,j as Mi,0 = 0 for i = 1, ..., n, M0,j = 0 for j = 1, ..., m, and M0,0 = 1.
Computing recursively for (i, j) ∈{1, ..., n} × {1, ..., m} the terms

Mi,j = (Mi,j−1 + Mi−1,j−1 + Mi−1,j)k(xi, yj)

we obtain that K(x, y) = Mn,m The result can be proved by recursion and is intuitively an equivalent
of the Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) [67, 17] algorithm where the max-sum algebra is simply
replaced by the sum-product one [18].

Theorem 2. triple kernel φ is a conditionally symmetric positive-definite kernel [18] defined on
X × X →R.

Proof. (i) for two slice a, b ∈Rd, meets |a| = |b| = 2 , d = d1 + d2, a = concat(a1, a2), b =
concat(b1, b2), a1, b1 ∈Rd1, a2, b2 ∈Rd2 and |a1| = |a2| = |b1| = |b2| = 1:

let a′ = concat(a′
1, a′
2, a′
3), a′ = concat(b′
1, b′
2, b′
3): when a′(b′) is from text modal, we let a′ =
concat(a1, a2, 0)(b′ = concat(b1, b2, 0)), and a′ = concat(a1, 0, a2)(b′ = concat(b1, 0, b2)) for
image modal. 0 ∈Rd2. we can unify the Equation 4 first and second case in:

φ(a, b) = φ(a′, b′)

= (|a′
2||b′
2| + |a′
3||b′
3|)||a′
1 −b′
1||2 + (1 −|a′
2||b′
2|)||a′

2||b′
2| + |a′
3||b′
3|)||a′

≥0

As (1−|a′
2||b′
2|) ≥0 and (1−|a′
3||b′
3|) ≥0. for any family α1, α2, ...αn ∈X and c1, c2, ..., cn ∈R,
we have that
X

i,j
cicjφ(xi, xj) =
X

i,j
cicjφ(x′
i, x′
j) ≥0

(ii) for two slice meets |a| = |b| = 1: for any family α1, α2, ...αn ∈X and c1, c2, ..., cn ∈R, we
have that
X

i,j
cicjφ(xi, xj) =
X

i,j
cicj||xi −xj||2 ≥0

Additionally, it’s evident that for both (i) and (ii), φ(a, b) = φ(b, a). Therefore, triple kernel φ is a
conditionally symmetric positive-definite kernel defined on X × X →R

Theorem 3. when both x and y contain only one slice, GAK is monotonically increasing with the
directly calculated cosine similarity.

Proof. let x = (x), y = (y), and cosine similarity of x and y is cos = cos < x, y >. we can get

σ = δ

r

M + N

2
= δ

r

1 + 1

2
= δ

and we have φ(a, b) = |a|2 + |b|2 −2cos < a, b >= 2(1 −cos < a, b >), thus:

φσ =

Letting t = 1−cos<a,b>

and substituting the result of φσ = t + log(2 −e−t) into Equation 2, we
obtain:

D.1
Architecture Details

We adopt the manifold multimodal model architecture [55, 52, 11, 6, 34], formulated as follows:

Visual Representation. We first process ximg subject to a visual representation backbone Vω that
outputs a sequence of features pimg ∈RL×hvision where pimg = Vω(ximg). As an example, pimg might
be the patch features output by a Vision Transformer.

Vision-Language Projector. Next, we map pimg to a sequence of embeddings eimg ∈RL×htext via a
learned projector Fψ, where eimg = Fψ(pimg).

Language Model. Finally, we concatenate the sequence eimg with the text prompt embeddings
eprompt = embed(uprompt), passing the result to the language model. Generally, we have the interleaved
image-text input xinput by concatting all the eprompt and eimg. The language model generates output
text ugen = LMθ(xinput).

Retrieval Projector. For discriminative tasks, we select the token di from MLLM’s hidden state and
map it to ri via a learned projector Fφ.

In Implementation, we utilize CLIP ViT-L/14 [73] as the visual encoder, and Vicuna 1.5 [14] as the
language model.

D.2
Sequence Alignment

An alignment π of length |π| = p between two sequences x and y is a pair of increasing p-tuples
(π1, π2) such that
1 = π1(1) ≤... ≤π1(p) = n,
1 = π2(1) ≤... ≤π2(p) = m,
(5)

We write A(x, y) for the set of all possible alignments between x and y. Intuitively, an alignment π
between x and y describes a way to associate each element of a sequence x to one or possibly more
elements in y, and vice versa. Such alignments can be conveniently represented by paths in the n × m
grid displayed in the left of Figure 3.

with unitary increments and no simultaneous repetitions, that is ∀1 ≤i ≤p −1,

π1(i + 1) ≤π1(i) + 1,
π2(j + 1) ≤π2(j) + 1,
(π1(i + 1) −π1(i)) + (π2(i + 1) −π2(i)) ≥1.
(6)

The score on a path is defined as:

S(π) =

|π|

i=1
φ(xπ1(i), yπ2(i))

Experimental Details

E.1
Datasets

Training Data.
Our vision-language task datasets are a subset of VILA [52], including
MMC4 [104], COYO [9], LLaVA-1.5 SFT dataset [55].

We use a prompt template formatted as (system-message is a system prompt from Vicuna, and the
following messages all have the same meaning.):

{system-message}. USER: <image>\n {question}. ASSISTANT: {answer}.

For interleaved vision-language datasets, the template is formatted as:

{system-message}. USER: {interleaving question}. ASSISTANT: {answer}.

Training Strategy.
To jointly train the discriminative loss and generative loss, we calculate the loss
as follows. Since the last token of an image is often a padding token, we take all 576 hidden state
tokens before the LM head for images and apply average pooling to obtain a single token. For text,
we directly take the last toke in the hidden state of MLLM.

During training, We calculate the discriminative loss using the last token from either the end of the
text or the image in the MLLM’s hidden state. Notably, in an interleaved input sequence with multiple
texts or images, we randomly select multiple last tokens from the same sequence to more efficiently
utilize the samples.

Evaluation Data.
For generative tasks, we first evaluate on a wide range of question-answering
tasks and some MLLM-oriented comprehension benchmarks, including VQA-v2 [27], GQA [35],
VizWiz [28], ScienceQA-IMG [61], TextVQA [76], POPE [51], MME [95], MMBench [58], LLaVA-
Bench (In-the-Wild) [56], MM-Vet [99] and. The split of test sets and the evaluation metrics are
aligned with those described in VILA[52] and LLaVA [55].

To test the generative ability in interleaving tasks, we use DEMON [47], a comprehensive benchmark
that demonstrative instruction following ability, including a wide variety of multi-modal datasets
from different fields and scenarios.

For generation tasks, our evaluation encompasses MSCOCO [38] for image-text retrieval, Visual
Storytelling (VIST) [32] for interleaved retrieval and Winoground [79] for fine-grained retrieval.

E.2
Training

We train the parameters for both the LLM and the MLP for embedding the MLLM’s hidden state,
initializing from VILA [52]. To enhance efficiency for the LLM, we employ LoRA tuning [30] on the
Wq and Wv matrices using low-rank adaptation. In our implementation, we set the rank r = 128 and
α = 256. We utilize the AdamW optimizer [60] in conjunction with a cosine learning rate scheduler.
The hyperparameters for the AdamW optimizer are configured with a warm-up ratio of 0.03 and a
maximum learning rate of 1e −4. Training is conducted on 8 x A800 GPUs for approximately 12
hours.

E.3
Introduction Experiment Details

(a) WebQA. The original WebQA contains two types of questions: "Qcate": "text" (open-ended
questions) and "Qcate": "YesNo" (binary judgment questions). For ease of evaluation, we only used
the second type. We selected 500 samples of the "YesNo" question type from WebQA [10], each
containing one relevant image-text pair and five unrelated image-text pairs. Since the original data
provides responses in declarative sentences, we modified the answers of these samples to be either
"yes" or "no" by prompting with "please answer the question in Yes or No."

(b) MMVP-VLM Benchmark. MMVP-VLM [81] contains 30 carefully annotated images in each
dimension of capability, with pairs of images being highly similar to each other (as indicated by their
high similarity scores in CLIP). To evaluate the discriminative ability of generative models on these
finely nuanced images, we transformed this dataset into a question-answering format. Each question
takes the following form:

{system-message}. USER: First Image:<image>\nSecond Image:<image>\n

which choice meets the first image:\n

A.{data["Statement"]}\nB.{data["Statement2"]}\n.please answer in A or B

ASSISTANT: {answer}.

Among them, both Statement 1 and Statement 2, as well as Image 1 and Image 2, are highly similar,
with only subtle differences. Furthermore, there is a corresponding relationship between Image 1
and Statement 1, and between Image 2 and Statement 2. We employed a random seed to ensure that
the correct answer is equally distributed between option A and option B. The specific values for the
experiment are provided in Table 6.

E.4
Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

For performing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we selected two tasks, namely VizWiz and
SQAI, as they provide held-in data not seen during model training. We did not use VQAv2, GQA,
and VQAT because their held-in data is a subset of the widely-used LLaVA-1.5 SFT. Benchmarks
like POPE, MMB, and others lack held-in data. Therefore, we focused on VizWiz and SQAI for our
experiments. We utilized a mixed set comprising the widely-used LLaVA-1.5 SFT subset and the
held-in dataset of the two tasks as the knowledge base and employed different retrieval modules to
retrieve relevant knowledge for the MLLM. Similar to common practice, we average the similarity
scores for CLIP (We choose CLIP ViT-L/14@336px). For BLIP-2, we compute the similarity
using its multimodal token’s CLS token. Figure 7 shows some specific retrieval results on test data,
demonstrating that Sugar can better integrate information from both images and text, retrieving more
similar data as external knowledge.

Details of Retrieval

Image-text Retrieval. FROMAGe [40] was evaluated on the 5K validation set of MSCOCO 2017.
Due to the split method confusion in FROMAGe, we report our image-text retrieval results on
MSCOCO val2014’s 5K val set following UniIR [84] and the Karpathy split [38]. What’s more we
then utilize FAISS [37], a powerful library for efficient similarity searches in dense vector spaces, to

index and retrieve candidates. Therefore, the results may exhibit slight differences when compared
under identical settings. The results in Table 3(a) are provided for reference only.

Interleaved Retrieval. We conduct evaluations across several experimental configurations, following
the same setup as FROMAGe [40]. The settings are as follows:

1. Retrieval of the last image given the descriptions of the preceding 5 images. This evaluates models’
ability to condition on temporally dependent language.

2. Retrieval of the last image given the descriptions of the preceding 5 images and the 4 preceding
images. This assesses models’ capability to process interleaved image-and-text context.

Fine-grained Retrieval. Winoground [79] is designed to evaluate the ability of vision and language
models to perform vision-linguistic compositional reasoning. The task involves matching two images
with two captions, where both captions contain an identical set of words/morphemes arranged in
different orders. This dataset, meticulously hand-curated by expert annotators, includes a rich set of
fine-grained tags to facilitate detailed performance analysis.

F.2
Quality Results

To analyze Sugar’s emergent behaviors and observed weaknesses, we present additional qualitative
samples that were not included in the main paper due to space constraints. Please note that for brevity,
we have omitted the system prompts and the line breaks after the images for all the quality examples.

We hope these additional results and observations showcase the potential of Sugar in various applica-
tion areas. In future work, it is important to investigate these emergent behaviors more thoroughly
and to understand the underlying mechanisms that enable Sugar to demonstrate such generalization
abilities. This will pave the way towards building better MLLMs, including enhancing robustness, re-
ducing biases, and improving the alignment and scope of the learned vision-language representations.

World Knowledge: We observe that Sugar can leverage the world knowledge [26] embedded within
the LLM to enhance performance on multimodal tasks. For example, as shown in Figure 4, the model
understands that during Halloween, people typically dress up in various ways to portray scary, funny,
or creative characters, such as ghosts and skeletons.

Retrieval the Same Sequence at Different Place: One interesting emergent behavior of Sugar
is its ability to retrieve sequences from different positions within the input interleaved sequence,
demonstrating flexibility and high sample efficiency, as shown in Figure 4. Unlike CLIP, which
requires encoding each sample separately, Sugar can encode sequences of varying lengths for the
same multi-modal document in a single forward pass.

What’s more, Sugar is capable of both retrieval and generation tasks. Below in Figure 8 are some
examples from the VIST dataset.

Fine-grained Image Discrimination: As shown in Figure 9, Sugar excels at accurately discerning
subtle differences between images and identifying detailed objects and their attributes. VILA, on the

between them. In contrast, Sugar provides more concise and direct answers.

The main difference between the two images is the perspective. In the first image, the view is from a higher angle, 
giving a broader view of the parking lot and the building. In contrast, the second image is taken from a lower angle, 
focusing on the entrance of the building. This difference in perspective allows for a more detailed view of the entrance 
and the surrounding area in the second image.

Swimming conditions: If you plan to swim in the lake, check for potential hazards such as submerged objects or 
strong underwater currents, and be aware of the water temperature.\n\n3. Wildlife: Some lakes may have local 
wildlife, such as snakes or alligators, which could pose a threat. Remain cautious and observant, especially near 
the water's edge.\n\n4. Weather conditions: The sky is cloudy, so be prepared for potential rainfall or changes in 
temperature, and monitor weather forecasts before your visit.\n\n5. Hiking in the surrounding area: If you plan to 
explore the green trees and mountains in the background, be cautious of potential hazards like steep and slippery 
terrain or unstable trail conditions. Carry appropriate hiking gear and wear sturdy footwear.\n\n6. Protect the 
environment: Be respectful of the natural beauty of the area, and avoid littering, damaging any trees or plants, or 
disturbing wildlife.

The city might be facing traffic congestion issues, particularly in the four-lane sections of the highway since most 
cars have their brake lights on, indicating slow or stopped traffic. Possible solutions could include:\n\n1. 
Implementing traffic management strategies, such as ramp meters to control the rate at which cars enter the 
highway or optimizing traffic signal timings to improve traffic flow.\n2. Encouraging the use of public 
transportation, carpooling or ride-sharing to reduce the number of cars on the road.\n3. Expanding or adding more 
lanes to ease traffic congestion in the four-lane sections of the highway.\n4. Exploring alternative routes to divert 
traffic from the congested areas.\n5. Improving walking and biking infrastructure in the city, thus promoting more 
sustainable and non-motorized modes of transport.

Interleaved Comprehension: As demonstrated by results from DEMON [47], Sugar exhibits
superior interleaved comprehension capabilities compared to VILA, particularly in tasks requiring
fine-grained analysis and an understanding of global context. For instance, in the third example
of Figure 11, VILA confuses character names, whereas Sugar maintains narrative coherence while
adhering to the style of the preceding text. Similarly, in the third example of Figure 12, VILA provides
an irrelevant response, while Sugar delivers a more contextually appropriate answer. Additionally,
Figure 13 demonstrates Sugar’s ability to effectively capture global information, identifying the
relevant images and text within the sequence to provide accurate responses.

Retrieval for Knowledge-based VQA

In this section, we use FVQA [83] and WebQA [10], two knowledge-based VQA datasets, to verify
Sugar’s effectiveness of combining retrieval and comprehension abilities in a single model, thereby
avoiding compatibility issues and suboptimal performance.

Historically, solving FVQA has relied on modeling the knowledge database using a Knowledge
Graph [13]. For WebQA, each question is associated with 10-20 knowledge bases, but only one is
relevant to the image and caption. FVQA knowledge is textual, whereas WebQA knowledge consists
of both text and pictures.

Implement Details. In this experiment, we used CLIP ViT-L/14@336px, and both experiments
report the ROUGE-L Score.

For FVQA, answers originate from two sources: directly from the image or from the knowledge
base. To minimize interference, we only tested questions requiring the knowledge base. We used the
following prompt for FVQA: "Please answer the questions based on the pictures. If the reference
information is useful, please use it. Otherwise, please ignore the reference information. Reference
information: retrieved knowledge <image> question." The baseline without retrieval means we did
not search for knowledge, but directly input the image and question for the model to answer. + CLIP
image means using the image to retrieve knowledge, + CLIP text means using the text to retrieve
knowledge, and + CLIP average means using the average annotations of both image and text to
retrieve knowledge. For our model, sugar+rag indicates the average result obtained using both image
and text to retrieve knowledge.

For WebQA, each question has 10-20 negative captions and images. Due to context length limitations
in LLaVA and VILA, we could not input all the data, necessitating a retrieval model to extract relevant
knowledge. Due to the large dataset size, we randomly selected 1000 samples. For WebQA, +CLIP
image means providing the positive image and using it to retrieve the most relevant text from the
knowledge base, which is then used as input for the model to answer the question. Conversely, +CLIP
text uses the text to retrieve relevant images. For our model, sugar+rag indicates the result obtained
using the average similarity score of the aforementioned methods.

Results. Based on Table 7, we can observe that while MLLM can answer a small portion of FVQA
questions using its internal knowledge, it still requires the support of a retriever for enhanced accuracy.
However, the impact of retrieval strategies on the results is inconsistent. For instance, using text
retrieval often outperforms image retrieval in FVQA, whereas in WebQA, image retrieval is more
effective. Additionally, there are compatibility issues between retrieval strategies and models. For
example, in WebQA, VILA is more sensitive to CLIP’s retrieval strategy, with fluctuations 3.4 times
greater than those of LLaVA-1.5. Our integrated retriever and generator model, however, does not
require an additional retriever and avoids the aforementioned optimization and selection issues.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims presented in the abstract and introduction provide an accurate
representation of the paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations of the work in Appendix B.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

31


---Page Break---
Justification: We give the proof in Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification:We give experimental setup and implementation details in Section 4.1 and
Appendix E.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

32


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: The codes will come soon and all the data is public to access.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we have provided necessary implementation details of our method in Ap-
pendix E.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We followed the baseline settings on the evaluation benchmark.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

33


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We give the statements of experiments compute resources in Appendix E.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, to the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the Broader Impacts in Appendix A.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

34


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have already cited all the original paper that produced the code package or
dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
