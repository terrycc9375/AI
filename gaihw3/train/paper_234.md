Abstract

Current multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from “hallucina-
tion”, occasionally generating responses that are not grounded in the input images.
To tackle this challenge, one promising path is to utilize reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), which steers MLLMs towards learning superior
responses while avoiding inferior ones. We rethink the common practice of using
binary preferences (i.e., superior, inferior), and find that adopting multi-level pref-
erences (e.g., superior, medium, inferior) is better for two benefits: 1) It narrows
the gap between adjacent levels, thereby encouraging MLLMs to discern subtle
differences. 2) It further integrates cross-level comparisons (beyond adjacent-level
comparisons), thus providing a broader range of comparisons with hallucination ex-
amples. To verify our viewpoint, we present the Automated Multi-level Preference
(AMP) framework for MLLMs. To facilitate this framework, we first develop an
automated dataset generation pipeline that provides high-quality multi-level prefer-
ence datasets without any human annotators. Furthermore, we design the Multi-
level Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm to robustly conduct com-
plex multi-level preference learning. Additionally, we propose a new hallucination
benchmark, MRHal-Bench. Extensive experiments across public hallucination and
general benchmarks, as well as our MRHal-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/takomc/amp.

Introduction

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have achieved remarkable advance-
ment in vision-language understanding tasks, e.g., vision question answering [7], image captioning [8],
and human-machine conversation. Despite MLLMs achieving significant breakthroughs, they still
suffer from hallucinations [9, 10], referring to responses that are not accurately anchored to the
context provided by images. This problem shrinks the performance of MLLMs and draws consid-
erable research attention. To mitigate the hallucinations, some existing methods [11, 12, 13, 14]
adopt Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods, which collect human/AI
preferences and integrate them into the MLLMs optimization process via reinforcement learning.

Existing RLHF methods have demonstrated that comparing superior and inferior responses within a
binary-level preference framework can improve the performance of optimized MLLMs. However,
Is a single comparison between superior and inferior responses sufficient for preference learning
in MLLMs? Upon consideration, we find that a multi-level preference framework offers greater
benefits for preference learning, primarily due to two main intuitive advantages. Firstly, reducing
the gap between adjacent levels helps mitigate the challenge of distinguishing micro hallucinations
in responses. As depicted in Fig. 1, in the baseline method (i.e., binary preference), significant
differences exist between the superior response A and the inferior response C. By introducing an
additional medium response and shifting the focus to multiple comparisons between adjacent levels

dataset. Contents highlighted in red signify hallucinations. Responses range from A to C, representing
varying degrees of quality from superior to inferior. Right: Illustrating the strategy for leveraging
inferior responses. (a) displays the conventional RLHF baseline, which adpots the binary-level
preference. (b) To mitigate the gap between adjacent levels, we first split a single comparison
into multiple comparisons by inserting extra medium responses. (c) Furthermore, we introduce the
cross-level comparison to augment the dataset with more hallucination examples.

("A>B", "B>C"), as highlighted by the red arrows in Fig. 1(b), we mitigate this issue. Interestingly,
under certain conditions, the MLLM’s performance with "A>C" comparison is even worse than that
with "B>C", indicating that reducing the gap between adjacent levels is sometimes more effective
than enhancing the quality of superior responses. Secondly, cross-level comparisons can further
enhance performance. In the comparisons between adjacent levels, the only comparison utilizing the
inferior response A is "A>B", which may lead the model to focus more on suppressing hallucinations
in response B. To address this, we introduce the cross-level comparison "A>C" (the green arrow in
Fig. 1(c)) to provide more negative examples, thereby helping the model suppress more possible
hallucinations. By integrating these strategies, we evolve the conventional binary-level preference
learning into a more sophisticated multi-level preference learning framework.

However, exploring multi-level preferences for MLLMs poses significant challenges: 1) Labeling
multi-level preference datasets is expensive and laborious. While some methods [11, 12] utilize
human annotators to obtain preference labels, this approach is effective for binary datasets but falls
short for multi-level preference datasets. Specifically, establishing a K-level preference dataset
requires human annotators to make K(K −1)/2 comparisons. For example, with K = 5, this
results in 10 comparisons, significantly more than is required for binary datasets. On the other hand,
datasets annotated by humans or AI often contain significant noise and bias. To investigate this, we
collected preferences from both humans and GPT-4V [15] on a subset of ShareGPT4V [16], using
three MLLMs to generate varied responses. Setting K to 3, we compared pairs of responses (A&B,
B&C, A&C) through three comparisons. However, we observed a frequent contradictory pattern
(A>B, B>C, C>A), with rates of approximately 14% and 11% in human and GPT-4V annotations,
respectively, resulting in a low-quality multi-level preference dataset. 2) The optimal multi-level
preference learning objective remains unclear. While multi-level preference is more beneficial for
optimizing MLLMs, it introduces greater complexity than binary preference. Therefore, it requires
an effective algorithm to fully utilize the knowledge embedded within multi-level preference datasets.

To overcome the challenges outlined above, we introduce innovative strategies at both the data
and method levels: 1) At the data level, we propose two novel methods for generating initial
multi-level preference datasets without human or AI annotators. Furthermore, we implement an
auto-check mechanism to further refine these datasets by evaluating the scores and accuracy of
the generated responses. 2) At the method level, we introduce the Multi-level Direct Preference
Optimization (MDPO) algorithm, a derivative of the traditional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
algorithm [17]. The MDPO algorithm extends the capabilities of the DPO algorithm to facilitate
multi-level preference optimization. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty term into the
MDPO learning objective to ensure robust multi-level preference learning. 3) Finally, we introduce
a new evaluation benchmark, MRHal-Bench, which is the first designed specifically to evaluate
hallucinations in multi-round dialogues. In summary, our contributions are as follows:

• Contrary to prior RLHF studies that focused solely on enhancing the quality of superior
responses, our findings indicate that inferior responses can also play a crucial role in reducing
hallucinations under the multi-level preference learning framework.

2.1
Multimodal Large Language Models

Recently, the multimodal learning community has witnessed the great success of MLLMs [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 18], which employ a cross-modal alignment module to connect the visual encoder [19, 20, 21]
and the language model [22, 23]. Typically, MLLMs undergo a standard training strategy involving
two stages. First, to bridge the gap between visual and textual representations, the cross-modal
alignment module is trained on a large-scale multimodal dataset [1, 24, 25], which endows the
LLMs with visual-understanding ability. Then, MLLMs are further fine-tuned on specific visual
instruction datasets [2, 16, 18, 26] to facilitate various downstream tasks [7, 8]. Despite the significant
advancement, MLLMs still suffer from hallucinations, which decrease their performance on multiple
tasks and attract increasing attention from researchers.

2.2
Hallucinations in MLLMs

Hallucinations in MLLMs [9, 10] denote inconsistencies between the input image and the generated
response. Unlike hallucinations in LLMs [27, 28], those observed in MLLMs are more complicated,
which attracts more attention from researchers. Some methods [26, 29] focus on reducing halluci-
nations by constructing high-quality datasets, while others employ specialized mechanisms such
as decoding strategies [30, 31], retrieval augmented generation [32], and chain-of-thought [33] to
mitigate hallucinations. However, due to the inherent limitations of cross-entropy loss, these methods
may provide insufficient guidance for modality alignment. Recently, reinforcement learning-based
methods [11, 12, 13, 14, 34], leveraging techniques like DPO [17] and PPO [35], have emerged as
promising direction. Yet, these methods rely on preference datasets annotated by humans or AI,
which are costly and susceptible to noise. Besides, they follow the traditional binary-level preference
framework, which is insufficient for preference learning of MLLMs. To address these problems,
we propose a novel AMP framework, utilizing a human-free multi-level preference dataset and the
MDPO algorithm to guide MLLMs.

Methods

In this section, we delve into the Automated Multi-level Preference (AMP) framework. Initially, we
outline two strategies for constructing an initial multi-level preference dataset, aligning with two
perspectives of the scaling law [36, 37]. Subsequently, we introduce the auto-check mechanism
aimed at refining the initial dataset based on relevant metrics. Lastly, we introduce the Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm, featuring a novel and robust learning objective.

3.1
Human-free Multi-level Preference Dataset Generation

The quality of the preference dataset significantly influences the refined model’s performance.
Constructing a high-quality initial preference dataset relies on two fundamental principles. Firstly,
the ranking between superior and inferior responses should be correct in most cases. Secondly, the
language style among different responses is expected to be consistent. Specifically, inconsistent
language styles can introduce biases that mislead the MLLM, resulting in reward hacking and
performance degradation [12, 36]. Considering these factors, we propose the Multi-size Expert
Generation (MEG) and Incremental Generation (IG) strategies to build reliable preference datasets
from the perspectives of model size and dataset size, respectively.

Figure 2: Pipeline for Constructing Human-free Multi-level Preference Dataset. We initiate the
process with Multi-size Expert Generation and Incremental Generation to establish the initial dataset.
Then, to enhance the quality of the initial preference dataset, we introduce the Auto-check Mechanism,
which calculates both global and local metrics based on sentences and noun chunks, respectively.

3.1.1
Multi-size Expert Generation

Scaling laws suggest that the performance of the model improves as the model size increases. Thus,
a logical strategy is to generate various responses using models of different sizes. For consistency
in language style, it’s preferable that these models stem from the same family. Specifically, we
adpot LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-2B [38], LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-13B, and LLaVA-34B [3].
Leveraging the standard response in the instruction tuning dataset [29], we procure up to 5 responses
of differing quality.

3.1.2
Incremental Generation

In Multi-size Expert Generation, our focus lies on employing models of various sizes, while Incre-
mental Generation involves training datasets of different sizes. In practice, we partition the entire
fine-tuned dataset F = {I; P; R} into K −2 equal parts for the K-rank preference dataset, where
I, P, and R symbolize the image, text prompt, and standard response, respectively. Then, we use
subsets Si = [F1, F2, ..., Fi] to fine-tune the pre-trained MLLM M, yielding K −2 fine-tuned
MLLMs, where i ∈[1, K −2]. Hence, the K −2 responses generated by fine-tuned MLLMs,
along with the response generated by the pre-trained MLLM and the standard response constitute the
K-rank preference dataset. The entire process is documented in Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 The Pseudocode of Incremental Generation for K-rank Preference Dataset.
Input: Image I, text prompt P, and standard response R for fine-tuned dataset F = {I; P; R},
annotated dataset A = {Ia; Pa; Ra}, pre-trained MLLM M.
Output: K-level preference dataset D = {Ia; Pa; [R0, R1, ..., RK−1]}.

1: Split F into K −2 equal parts [F1, F2, ..., FK−2];
2: for (i = 1 to K −2) do
3:
Train M with subset Si = [F1, F2, ..., Fi] ⇒Get fine-tuned MLLM Mi;
4:
Ri = Mi(Ia, Pa);
{Generate response Ri via fine-tuned MLLM Mi}
5: end for
6: R0=Ra, RK−1=M(Ia, Pa);
7: return D = {Ia; Pa; [R0, R1, ..., RK−1]}.

3.1.3
Auto-check Mechanism

In the aforementioned process, we devised two strategies to establish the initial multi-level preference
dataset. While the rankings in this dataset are generally accurate, occasional anomalies may lead to
incorrect preferences. To enhance the ranking accuracy, we introduce the auto-check mechanism.

First, we identify all nouns in the various responses, including terms like “motorhome”, “street”,
etc. Note that certain nouns are deprecated (further details are provided in Appendix A.1). Next,
we analyze the dependency relationships within the sentence to extend each noun into the longest
possible noun chunks. For example, “a white motorhome, which is parked on a street” would be
represented (denoted by pink color in Fig. 2).

After extracting all noun chunks, we send them into the noun chunk expert (i.e., the text encoder of
CLIP [19]) to obtain text features FS = {fS1, fS2, ..., fSM} and FG = {fG1, fG2, ..., fGN}, where
M and N denote the number of noun chunks in standard and generated responses, respectively. We
then calculate the similarity score as outlined in Eq. 1:

S[m, n] =
fSm · fGn
∥fSm∥× ∥fGn∥,
s[m] = max(S[m, :]),
(1)

where S ∈RM×N is the similarity matrix between standard and generated responses. s ∈RM
represents the similarity score of generated response FG. We further introduce the accuracy metric:

p[m] =

1
if
s[m] > τ
0
otherwise
,
Acc = Sum(p)/M,
(2)

where τ is the threshold, set to 0.85. Accuracy (Acc) reflects the completeness of the credible
components within the generated response.

While noun chunks represent the consistency at a local level, entire sentences represent global
consistency, such as the relationships between multiple objects and the actions of objects, etc. To
assess global consistency, we retrieve the sentences where each noun chunk is located as the global
representation. The relevant metrics of sentences are the same as those of noun chunks.

Finally, we compute the final accuracy and scores by averaging the local and global metrics. Among
the generated responses, the one with the highest accuracy is regarded as the best. In cases where
multiple responses achieve equal accuracy, the one with the highest scores is considered superior.

3.2
Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO)

Reinforcement learning algorithms [11, 12, 13, 14, 34] have demonstrated promising results in
training MLLMs with human-preference datasets. Encouraged by the success of these pioneers, we
delve deeper into the potential of multi-level preferences. In this section, we design the Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm, furnishing a novel and robust learning objective.

3.2.1
Preliminary

Prevalent methods [11, 39, 40] leverage the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to align
with preference data. However, the performance of this approach highly depends on the extra reward
model, which is sensitive to noises within the preference dataset. Besides, the last stage of PPO
fine-tunes the actor and critic model with the online strategy, resulting in high computational costs and
unstable procedures. To mitigate these issues, DPO [17] excludes the reward model by analytically
expressing reward functions with optimal policy π∗and initial policy πref. Denote x and y as the
inputs and outputs of MLLMs, the reward function is converted into:

r(x, y) = β log π∗(y|x)

πref(y|x) + β log Z(x),
(3)

where Z(·) is the partition function, β is a constant. Under the Bradley-Terry model, the policy
objective becomes:

LDPO(πθ; πref) = −E(x,yw,yl)∼D [log σ (r(x, yw) −r(x, yl))] ,

= −E(x,yw,yl)∼D


log σ

β log πθ(yw|x)

πref(yw|x) −β log πθ(yl|x)

,
(4)

where σ(·) represents the Sigmoid function, and x, yw, and yl denote inputs, superior and inferior
responses, respectively. In practice, πref remains frozen during DPO training. Thus, only the policy
model πθ is updated in the training process, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

3.3
Learning Objective of MDPO Algorithm

To facilitate the multi-level preference dataset, we revise the learning objective for K-rank with
K(K −1)/2 comparisons:

LMDPO(πθ; πref) = −

πref(yj|x)


,

(5)
where the quality of response yi is superior to yj.

During MDPO training, we observed that despite the loss decreasing normally, the optimized MLLM
sometimes generates certain words or phrases repetitively. This occurs because the probability of the
policy model producing both superior and inferior responses simultaneously decreases. While the
probability of generating inferior responses declines more rapidly, the policy model’s capability to
generate superior responses also diminishes, leading to an overall deterioration in performance. To
mitigate this risk, we introduce an additional penalty term, modifying Eq. 4 as follows:

LDPO−P (πθ; πref) = −E(x,yw,yl)∼D


log σ

β log πθ (yw | x)

πref (yw | x) −β log πθ (yl | x)

πref (yl | x)



+ log πθ (yw | x)

πref (yw | x)


.
(6)

With this penalty term, the probability of generating superior responses is explicitly improved. To
minimize the impact of medium-quality responses, we apply the penalty term exclusively to the best
response. Consequently, the learning objective of MDPO is formulated as:

LMDPO(πθ; πref) = −

Experiments and Analysis

4.1
Implementation Details

We adpot LLaVA-v1.5 [3] as our base model for all experiments, which is built upon Vicuna [22, 23]
and utilizes ViT-L/14 [19] as the image encoder. Our training dataset contains 1k detailed captions
from ShareGPT4V [16], 4k image-text pairs from [34], 4k human-annotated data from [12] and 2k
multi-round dialogues annotated by us (the annotated process is detailed in Appendix A.2), forming
a total of 11k training instances. For training MDPO, we employ the AdamW [41] optimizer for
4 epochs and apply a peak learning rate of 5 × 10−5 with the cosine decay strategy. To enhance
learning efficiency, we incorporate LoRA-based [42] fine-tuning, with a low-rank r set to 64 for both
attention and feed-forward modules. All experiments are conducted with a batch size of 16 on 8
Nvidia A100 GPUs with 40G VRAM. Further implementation details of the Human-free Multi-level
Preference Dataset generation are provided in Appendix A.3.

Evaluation Benchmarks

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed AMP framework, we conduct comprehensive comparisons
with various baselines across several benchmarks, including QA-based hallucination benchmark
POPE [9], fine-grained hallucination benchmark MMHal-Bench [11], general benchmark LLaVA-
Bench [2], and our newly developed multi-round dialogue hallucination benchmark MRHal-Bench.

binary responses (‘yes’ or ‘no’). MMHal-Bench is designed to quantify hallucinations with the
assistance of GPT-4 [43]. Different from the simple questions in conventional benchmarks, MMHal-
Bench contains more general, open-ended, and fine-grained questions. LLaVA-Bench serves as a
general benchmark for systematic comprehension, encompassing three categories: conversation,
detailed description, and complex questions. In addition to these benchmarks, we introduce MRHal-
Bench to evaluate hallucinations in multi-round dialogues, covering six aspects: attribute, description,
existence, counting, reasoning, and spatial relation. For further details, please refer to Appendix A.4.

Comparisons with Leading Methods

We compare our method with multiple MLLMs, including two types of state-of-the-art models: 1)
General MLLMs. We include LLaVA [2], InstructBLIP [4], LLaVA-V1.5 [3], and Qwen-VL-Chat [6]
as high-performing, open-sourced general models. These models are trained on extensive datasets and
demonstrate promising results across various tasks. 2) RLHF-based MLLMs. Our comparisons also
extend to RLHF models such as LLaVA-RLHF [11], RLHF-V [12], POVID [14], SILKIE [34], and
FGAIF [13]. Specifically, LLaVA-RLHF employs the PPO algorithm on 10k human-preference data
and 72k factually augmented data for reward and policy models, respectively. RLHF-V utilizes 1.4k
human-annotated, fine-grained preference data to optimize the policy model using the DPO algorithm.
Both [13] and [34] apply the DPO algorithm to align MLLMs with GPT-4V preferences. POVID [14]
generates hallucination examples through two strategies and also uses the DPO algorithm.

The quantitative results are shown in Table 1 and 2. We observe that our AMP surpasses all general
MLLMs across all benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of further fine-tuning with the preference
dataset. Besides, our method also achieves state-of-the-art performance among RLHF-based methods,
which comes from two aspects. First, our MDPO algorithm facilitates multi-level preference learning,
which enables the MLLM to discern semantic granularity among different responses. Second, the
accurate ranking of our human-free preference dataset ensures reliable guidance for the MLLM,
leading to more promising performance. We also provide some qualitative case studies in Fig 3. For
more cases, please refer to Appendix A.5.

Impact of Preference Quantity. We explore the effects of varying the number of preferences from
2 to 5, with detailed implementation found in Appendix A.6. As indicated in Table 3, a 4-level
preference is identified as the optimal setting. We hypothesize that the diminished performance
observed with a 5-level preference dataset may be due to increased hidden noise. Unless stated
otherwise, all subsequent experiments are conducted on an MLLM using the Vicuna-7B, trained on
the 4-level preference dataset produced through Multi-size Expert Generation.

Impact of Gap between Adjacent Levels. The effectiveness of multi-level preference learning is
partly attributed to reducing the gaps between adjacent levels. As shown in Table 4, we reduce the
gap by “S>B ⇒S>A” and “A>C ⇒B>C”, both of which result in performance enhancements.

Impact of Including More Comparisons. We further introduce more inferior responses, i.e.,
‘Response B’ and ‘Response C’, by “S>A ⇒S>A & S>B” and “S>A & S>B ⇒S>A & A>B &
B>C”. The improvements depicted in Table 4 verify that inferior responses are also beneficial for
preference learning. To provide more comparisons between the best response and hallucination
examples, we devise cross-level comparisons based on settings “S>A & S>B” and “S>A & A>B &
B>C”. As illustrated in Table 4, this strategy brings extra performance improvement across multiple
benchmarks, indicating the necessity of cross-level comparisons.

Comparisons with AI-Annotated Preference. Similar to reinforcement learning methods using
AI feedback [46], we use GPT-4V [15] to directly rank the responses generated by MEG based on
their visual faithfulness and helpfulness. Table 5 illustrates that training with our preference dataset
yields more effective results compared to the AI-annotated preference dataset. This suggests that our
human-free multi-level preference dataset contains less noise. Furthermore, the performance of the
MLLM significantly decreases in the absence of our Auto-check mechanism, highlighting its crucial
role in accurately refining the ranking of the multi-level preference dataset.

4.5
Comparisons with other Rank-based Preference Alignment Approaches.

We make some empirical comparisons by replacing our MDPO with the learning objectives of [47]
and [48]. As reported in Table 6, our MDPO surpasses these two learning objectives on all hallu-
cination benchmarks, e.g., 3.01 -> 3.17 on MMHal-Bench. The superiority of our MDPO comes
from two aspects. First, our MDPO mitigates the challenge of distinguishing micro hallucinations in
responses. Taking 3-level preference as an example, the comparisons of other methods are ‘A>BC,
B>C’, while comparisons made by our AMP are ‘A>B, A>C, B>C’. More specifically, our AMP splits
‘A>BC’ into ‘A>B, A>C’, which enables MLLMs to perceive the subtle differences between different
responses. Second, our penalty term explicitly increases the probability of MLLMs generating good
answers, ensuring the stability of the training process.

We also conduct some experiments about perturbation-based (PB) methods. Our implementation
details are as follows. We randomly change the noun, adjective, preposition, and numeral. We obtain

answers of varying quality by controlling the proportion of perturbations (10%, 30%, 50% based on
4-level preference setting). As shown in Table 6, perturbation-based methods is still inferior to our
MDPO. We infer the hallucination pattern generated by random perturbation is different from the
real MLLM and is thus not informative enough for preference learning.

4.6
Evaluation of the Automated Multi-level Preference Dataset

We estimate the inconsistency rate of our AMP dataset to be 2.25% (through manual evaluation on
2000 random samples). The 2.25% inconsistency rate is significantly lower than the human (14.40%
inconsistency) and GPT-4V (11.95% inconsistency) annotations.

Moreover, we conduct another experiment to validate the superiority of our AMP dataset. We mix
the AMP and human/GPT-4V data for training the model. Fig. 4 shows that as the proportion of
human/GPT-4V annotated data increases, the performance of MLLMs decreases accordingly.

5
Limitations

Our AMP framework offers more effective preference learning from the human-free multi-level
preference dataset. However, several challenges remain: 1) The quality of standard responses
limits the performance of the optimized MLLM. A portion of the standard responses in our dataset
comes from superior responses generated by language models, potentially containing imperceptible
hallucinations. Besides, the standard response is less helpful despite its high faithfulness, further
restricting the performance. 2) Although our AMP successfully reduces hallucinations and promotes
the truthfulness of MLLMs, the essence of preference learning is pushing the model to bias the
preference dataset, causing a decrease in generalization ability. Therefore, finding a balance between
preference learning and maintaining the capabilities of MLLMs is yet to be explored.

6
Conclusions

In this paper, we introduce the Automated Multi-level Preference (AMP) framework, achieving
promising performance on several hallucination benchmarks, which benefits from the reduction
of gaps in adjacent levels and the introduction of cross-level comparison. To enable the AMP
framework, we propose a multi-level preference dataset generation pipeline, aiming to construct
a high-quality preference dataset automatically. Furthermore, we design the Multi-level Direct
Preference Optimization algorithm, which furnishes a novel learning objective to ensure robust and
efficient preference learning. Lastly, we conduct the first hallucination benchmark in multi-round
dialogues and devise the relevant metrics, which may stimulate future research.

Omitted Nouns in Auto-check Mechanism

Similar to [5], we exclude some abstract nouns, e.g., "time", "effect", etc.
Besides, some high-
frequency but unnecessary nouns, such as "image", "photo", etc, are also deprecated. The complete
list is depicted in Fig. 5.

Unnecessary Nouns: 'photo', 'image', 'photograph', 'picture', 'figure', 
'painting'.

Abstract Nouns: 'harmony', 'beauty', 'feel', 'concentration', 'life', 'matter',  
'feature', 'effect', 'skill', 'detail', 'emotion', 'nature', 'time', 'background', 
'placement', 'perspective', 'universality', 'attention', 'features', 'essence', 
'peace', 'composition', 'element', 'foreground', 'appreciation', 'atmosphere', 
'emotions', 'artwork', 'subject'.

A.2
Annotated Process of Multi-round Dialogues in Training Dataset

We introduce 2k multi-round dialogues in our training dataset. To get diverse questions, we use
GPT-4V [15] to generate questions and corresponding responses, where the prompt is as Fig. 6.

However, the responses generated by GPT-4V still contain hallucinations. To get the high-quality
response, we further employ Qwen-VL-Chat [6], LLaVA-v1.5 13B [3], LLaVA-RLHF 13B [11],
RLHF-V [12] to provide three extra responses. Thus, together with the response of GPT-4V, we get
5 responses in total. Then, we send these responses to human annotators and ask them to find the
optimal response. If the optimal response still exhibits hallucinations, this image-text pair will be
deprecated. Through these steps, we get the final 2k high-quality multi-round dialogues.

A.3
Details of Human-free Multi-level Preference Dataset Generation

A.3.1
Multi-size Expert Dataset Generation

To make the language style more consistent, we use models from the same family, including LLaVA-
2B, LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-13B, and LLaVA-34B. We leverage the greedy decoding strategy with
specific parameters: beams (4), temperature (0.7), repetition penalty (1.1), and max tokens (512).

A.3.2
Incremental Generation

In the Incremental Generation Generation, we obtain MLLMs with varying capabilities by using train
datasets of different sizes. Specifically, we use the 7B version of LLaVA-V1.5 as the pre-trained
model and follow the training detail of [3] and further fine-tune it on 30k/60k/90k high-quality image-
text pairs. The whole dataset contains 10k ShareGPT4V [16], 20k Flickr30k [49], 30k VQAv2 [50],
and 30k LRV [26]. Finally, we get 5 different responses, including the Ground Truth (GT), responses
generated by 3 fine-tuned MLLMs and LLaVA-V1.5.

A.4
Multi-round Dialogue Hallucination Benchmark (MRHal-Bench)

To evaluate the hallucinations in multi-round dialogue, we build a Multi-round Dialogue Hallucination
Benchmark, simplified by "MRHal-Bench". Specifically, MRHal-Bench contains 105 multi-round
dialogues, where the length of rounds ranges from 2 to 5, with an average length of 2.99. The
questions in MRHal involve five categories where MLLMs tend to generate hallucinations:

• Attribute: Visual characteristics of objects, including color, shape, state, type, etc.

• Description: Detailed descriptions of objects, behaviors, environments, background, fore-
ground, etc.

You are an image content annotation expert, and you are seeing a single image. 
Design a multi-round conversation between you and a person asking about this 
photo. 

The conversation format is 
User: ********
GPT: ********
where the user is the role of the person, and GPT is the role of you.

The answers should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is seeing the image and 
answering the question. Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers. 
Only include questions that have definite answers: 
(1) Ask the questions that can be answered confidently. Do not ask ambiguous 
questions. Do not give any ambiguous answers. 
(2) Your answers may involve some facts about the image, such as news, social, 
science, etc.

First, your questions may include the characteristics of all the objects or elements 
in the image, their type, color, and style, the number of objects, the movement of 
the characters, the precise location, text, etc. Also include complex questions that 
are relevant to the content in the image, for example, asking about background 
knowledge of the objects in the image, asking to discuss events happening in the 
image, etc. Again, do not ask about uncertain details, do not imagine anything. 
Provide detailed answers when answering complex questions. For example, give 
detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and 
well-organized. You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary. Your output 
should only contain the conversations without any other things.

Figure 6: The text prompt for GPT-4V in the annotated process of multi-round dialogue.

• Existence: Questions with absolute answers, e.g., yes/no.
• Counting: The number of specific objects.
• Reasoning: Questions that require the model to integrate analysis based on image content or
other knowledge to generate final responses.
• Spatial Relation: The relative or absolute spatial relationships of objects in given images.

To obtain a fair, objective, and trustable evaluation result, we employ GPT-4 via a meticulous template.
Since GPT-4V also suffers from hallucinations, we use GPT-4 API and replace visual contents with
category names and a standard human-generated answer, which is similar with [11]. The template
will be released in our code.

We design two types of metrics for evaluating MRHal-Bench, i.e., cumulative and mean metrics
(denoted by c/m in Section 4). The cumulative (Metricc) and mean scores (Metricm) are calculated
by,

Metricc =

105
X

i=1
[Sum (Metrici)] /

105
X

i=1
[Len (Metrici)] ,

Metricm =

( 105
X

i=1
[Sum (Metrici) /Len (Metrici)]

)

/105,

(8)

where Metrici ∈Rj symbolizes the Metric of i-th dialogue with j rounds.

MRHal-Bench will be available at this link.

Yes, I can see a person wearing a bright yellow helmet in the image. This person is likely a skier or 
snowboarder, as they are riding a ski lift up a snowy mountain. The presence of the yellow helmet 
suggests that the person is taking safety precautions while engaging in winter sports activities.
Wearing a helmet is essential for protecting the head from potential injuries during skiing or 
snowboarding. It can help prevent serious head injuries, as well as provide protection from cold 
weather conditions. The bright color of the helmet also makes it easier for others to spot the 
person on the slopes, which can be helpful in case of emergencies or when visibility is limited.

Case Studies

In Fig. 7, we present some examples of our AMP alongside other MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-V1.5 [3], and
LLaVA-RLHF [11] for an intuitive comparison. We focus on four typical scenarios. 1) Short-form

17


---Page Break---
Question Answering (QA). Our AMP generally provides accurate responses, such as the counting
(e.g., “four bicycles”) and character (e.g., “Proverbial Philosophy”). 2) Long-form QA. Our AMP
outperforms other MLLMs in terms of helpfulness and faithfulness. Specifically, our AMP accurately
interprets all the valuable information in the given image, including the time, date, and temperature.
In contrast, other MLLMs make a wrong judgment about or neglect the information in this image. 3)
Existence Hallucinations. Compared with responses from other MLLMs, our AMP is not misdirected
by “identify a person wearing a bright yellow helmet” and predicts the non-existence of this person.
4) Image Caption. For the detailed caption, our AMP captures all the significant visual components
correctly and infers the location (“Swiss Alps”) from the Swiss national flag and mountains. However,
other MLLMs overlook this flag and generate some hallucinations about people and cars. These
qualitative results verify the superiority of our AMP framework.

A.6
Implementation Details of Optimal-Level Experiments

In Section 4.4, we report the performance of K-level preferences, where K ranges from 2 to 5.
When K is equal to 4, the refined MLLM gets the best performance. However, the performance
of optimized MLLM varies from different model pools. Take K = 3 as the example, the model
pool may be ‘Response S&34B&13B’, ‘Response S&13B&7B’, etc. The performance of optimized
MLLM varies from different model pools. Therefore, we only report the optimal performance under
each level, where the details of model pools are reported in Table 7.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide our contributions both in the abstract and introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We express our limitations in Section 5.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Yes, we claim our experimental settings. Our code is available at this link.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our code and data is available at this link.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The training and test details are described in the experiment section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

21


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide these information in the implementation details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our research follows the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

22


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original paper for assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: MRHal-Bench is available at this link.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
