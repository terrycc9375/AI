Abstract

We present a theoretical analysis of the Elo rating system, a popular method for
ranking skills of players in an online setting. In particular, we study Elo under the
Bradley–Terry–Luce model and, using techniques from Markov chain theory, show
that Elo learns the model parameters at a rate competitive with the state of the art.
We apply our results to the problem of efficient tournament design and discuss a
connection with the fastest-mixing Markov chain problem.

Introduction

The Elo rating system is a popular method for calculating the relative skills of players (or teams) in
sports analytics and particularly chess [2, 4, 1, 3]. It is based on a simple zero-sum update rule: if
player i beats player j, then the rating of player i increases proportionally to the model probability
that i would lose to j, while the rating of j decreases by the same amount. This amount depends on
the previously estimated difference in skills between i and j.

Despite their widespread popularity, Elo rating systems still lack a rigorous theoretical understand-
ing [6]. Here, we take a probabilistic approach and study Elo under the well-known Bradley–Terry–
Luce model (BTL) [11, 28]. In this model, the probability pi,j that i wins against j is wi/(wi + wj),
where wk is the strength of player k. In Elo, this is usually reparametrised via wk = eρk:

pi,j = eρi/(eρi + eρj) = 1/(1 + eρj−ρi) = σ(ρi −ρj),

where ρk is the true rating of k and σ(z) := 1/(1 + exp(−z)) for z ∈R is the sigmoid function. In
this setting, after observing i beat j, the corresponding Elo ratings xi and xj are updated as

xi ←xi + ησ(xj −xi)
and
xj ←xj −ησ(xj −xi),

where the step-size η > 0 is chosen by the modeller. The size of the update depends exponentially on
the difference in ratings: beating a much lower rated opponent does not change the ratings much.

The goal of the Elo rating system is to estimate the true ratings of n players by observing results
of matches between pairs of players. It is, therefore, aiming to solve the problem of ranking from
pairwise comparisons. Compared with most algorithms in the area [5, 20, 27, 31, 37], however, Elo
benefits from three qualities that help explain its popularity in real-world applications: simplicity,
interpretability and the ability to update a ranking of the players in an online fashion.

The knowledgeable reader might have noticed that Elo’s update rule is actually based on the gradient
of the BTL log-likelihood: Elo can be interpreted simply as stochastic gradient descent with fixed
step-size. Rather than studying Elo from a convex optimisation angle, however, we take a more
probabilistic point of view: we assume at each time t, players i and j are selected to play against one
another with probability qi,j. This allows us to interpret Elo as a Markov chain over Rn and deploy
powerful tools to study its behaviour. On the other hand, this approach also presents us with some
challenges: Elo is not a reversible Markov chain and, while it has a unique stationary distribution,
assuming a minor and natural condition on (qi,j)i,j [7], it does not converge to it in total variation [6].

1.1
Our Results

Our main contribution (Theorem 2.5) shows that Elo ratings, averaged over time, well-approximate
the true ratings of the players with high probability. In order to avoid the potential of unbounded
ratings, which are unrealistic in practice, we consider a variant of Elo in which ratings are capped,
whilst maintaining their zero-sum property. We obtain rates of convergence with respect to the number
of observed matches that are competitive against the state of the art in the BTL literature. In contrast
to most other algorithms for the BTL model studied in the literature, Elo learns the parameters of a
BTL model in an online fashion. These rates of convergence is remarkable since Elo was originally
conceived as a simple ranking system for chess players. Furthermore, our approach is very robust,
and also applies to a parallel set-up in which multiple games are played concurrently.

We also discuss the problem of tournament design: we assume we are given a tournament (compari-
son) graph G = ([n], E), and we would like to choose the match-up probabilities (qi,j){i,j}∈E so
that Elo’s convergence rate is maximised. We highlight a connection between this problem and that of
finding the fastest mixing Markov chain on G [10, 39], where the corresponding Markov chain on the
graph is either in discrete or continuous time depending on whether we optimise number of games or
parallel rounds, respectively. As far as we know, this connection has not been made formally before
in the sequential set-up, and both the analysis and optimisation of the parallel set-up are new. In §4,
we also provide experimental results that showcase the usefulness of our strategy.

1.2
Related Work

Despite Elo ratings being the standard ranking system in many sports analytics communities [38],
there is a scarcity of work analysing Elo from a probabilistic perspective. In particular, we are aware
only of [6], and the unpublished notes [7] by the same author, in which Elo is studied as a Markov
process and convergence in distribution to a unique stationary distribution is proved.

If we consider Elo as a technique to estimate the parameters of the BTL model, there is a wealth of
recent literature on the topic by the machine learning community [20, 37, 31, 5, 27, 9]. In contrast to
our setting, however, previous work typically considers an offline scenario, in which the ratings of the
players are computed after all the scheduled matches have taken place. By standard concentration
inequalities, this allows one to obtain a very good approximation of the probability a player wins
against their neighbours in the comparison graph. The goal is then to deduce a global ranking of
the players from such (very good) local information. In our setting, Elo ratings are dynamically
updated before a good local approximation is achieved, which makes the analysis more challenging
and requires the use of powerful, but delicate, concentration inequalities for Markov chains.

A comparison between the rate of convergence for Elo ratings obtained in our work and the rate of
convergence of other algorithms for the BTL model is discussed in §2.

Finally, we mention that the connection between Markov chains and stochastic gradient descent with
fixed step size has been studied before, e.g., in [17].

Convergence Rates of Elo Ratings

In this section, we state our main result on the convergence rate of the time-averaged Elo ratings,
discuss related work and outline the most important parts of the proof.

Throughout the paper, “f ≲g” means “f = O(g)”, “f ≪g” means “f = o(g)” and “whp” means
“with probability 1 −O(1/n)”; the notation ˜O(·) hides logarithmic factors; finally, Eπ[·] indicates
that X0 ∼π.

2.1
Our Results

We start with the explicit definition of our Markov chain.

Definition 2.1 (Elo Process). Let M ∈R and n ≥2. Let ρ ∈[−M, M]n with P

k ρk = 0. Let q be
a distribution on unordered pairs in [n]. Let η ∈(0, 1

4). A step of EloM(q, ρ; η) proceeds as follows.

0. Suppose that the current vector of ratings is x ∈Rn.

2


---Page Break---
1. Choose unordered pair {I, J} to play according to q:

P[{I, J} = {i, j}] = q{i,j}
for all
i, j ∈[n].

2. Suppose that Player I beats J, which has probability σ(ρI −ρJ). Update ratings xI and xJ:

xI ←xI + ησ(xJ −xI);
xJ ←xJ −ησ(xJ −xI).

3. Orthogonally project the full vector of ratings to [−M, M]n ∩{x′ ∈Rn | P

k x′
k = 0}.

Let Xt
k denote the rating of Player k at time t, and π the equilibrium distribution on Rn. Denote by

At,T

t

k ∈[n]
and
t, T > 0

the time-averaged ratings. We typically start from X0 = (0, ..., 0). The (deterministic) time T is a
burn-in phase, which allows the Elo ratings to get ‘near’ the true skills, after which we start averaging.
Remark 2.2. The projection step ensures the Elo ratings do not become too large. It is required for
our analysis, but not usually implemented in practice. Indeed, our experiments, discussed in §4,
suggest that, as long as the step-size η is small enough, Elo ratings remain bounded. Algorithms
which estimate BTL parameters typically require some sort of projection [20] or regularisation [27].
A simple and efficient algorithm to realise the orthogonal projection is presented in the Appendix.

We show, for a suitable choice of parameters t, T and η, that the time-averages are concentrated around
the true ratings. In other words, we can use Elo to obtain an MCMC estimate of the true ratings.

Elo ratings in equilibrium are, in general, a biased estimator of the true ratings: i.e., Eπ[X0
k] ̸= ρk.
Hence, there will be both a bias and an error term in our MCMC-type estimate of ∥At,T −ρ∥2.

The MCMC convergence rate depends on a spectral gap λq. This parameter quantifies how fast local
information about the relative strengths of two players is propagated to the rest of the ratings. Similar
parameters appear in most of the related literature, e.g., [37, 27].
Definition 2.3 (Spectral Gap). Let q be a distribution on unordered pairs in [n]. Define qi,j := q{i,j},
di,j := 1{i = j} P

k qi,k and ∆i,j := di,j −qi,j for i, j ∈[n]. Let λq denote the spectral gap
(second smallest eigenvalue) of the Laplacian ∆. Always, ∆1 = 0 and ∆is positive semi-definite.
Remark 2.4. Equivalently, λq is the spectral gap of the continuous-time Markov chain on [n] with
transition rates qi,j = q{i,j} for i, j ∈[n]. Note the scaling: P

i,j qi,j = 2. So, the typical time until
the continuous-time chain jumps is order n, not order 1. This implies λq ≤4/n; see Lemma B.2.

We assume λq > 0. This holds unless there exists a non-empty subset S ⊊[n] with P

i∈S,j̸∈S qi,j =
0—i.e., players in S never play those in Sc. This makes estimation of the ratings impossible.

Our main result measures the disparity between the time-averaged Elo ratings and the true ratings.
Theorem 2.5 (Convergence Rate). Let X ∼EloM(q, ρ; η), as in Definition 2.1. Let C1, C2 < ∞.
Then, there exists a constant C0, depending only on (C1, C2), such that if

min{λq, η, 1/t} ≥n−C1
and
min{t, T} ≥C0t⋆,
where

Remark 2.6. Ideally, λqn = ˜Ω(1); e.g., if q is uniform over the edges of an expander graph, then
λqn ≍1. In this case, we view (log n)2/(λqn) = ˜O(1) as the error’s pre-factor and 1/(λqt)
as the (squared) convergence rate. Also, we can then choose η = ˜Ω(1) and obtain non-trivial
convergence results. This choice of η is comparable to that used in practice. Moreover, on average,
only ˜O(1) games per player are need to be observed to guarantee good approximation of the ratings.

The η term arises from the average bias 1

n∥EX∼π[X]−ρ∥2
2, which is non-zero in general. An estimate
on the average variance 1

Theorem 2.7 (Bias and Variance). If π is the equilibrium distribution of EloM(q, ρ; η), then

Despite Elo ratings being biased, the estimated probability a player wins their next match is not:
P

j∈[n] qi,j EX∼π[σ(Xi −Xj)] = P

j∈[n] qi,jσ(ρi −ρj)
for all
i ∈[n].

This holds when no projection step is performed as part of the Elo update (equivalently, M := +∞).

The mixing time is more delicate, as the chain makes deterministic-size discrete jumps, but its
equilibrium distribution is continuous and, therefore, the chain does not converge in total variation.
Instead, we measure convergence in the Wasserstein, also known as transportation, distance.
Theorem 2.8 (Contraction). If X, Y ∼EloM(q, ρ; η), then there exists a step-by-step coupling with

E(x,y)[∥Xt −Y t∥2
2] ≤(1 −κ)t∥x −y∥2
2
where
κ := 1

8e−2Mηλ.

Markov chains satisfying the contraction property (i.e., positively curved) satisfy powerful concentra-
tion inequalities, developed particularly by Joulin and Ollivier [22, 23, 34, 33, 24]. The idea is that if
∥X0 −Y 0∥2 = D0, then Dt := ∥Xt −Y t∥2 is small when t ≍κ−1 log D0. For us, D0 ≤2Mn,
leading to t⋆≍κ−1 log n. In the reversible case, this can provide bounds, e.g., on the spectral gap.

The approach is particularly applicable to Markov chains on finite metric spaces, such as graphs. The
set-up of finite graphs was analysed by Bubley and Dyer [12] under the name path coupling. In this
case, E[Dt] ≤1

2 implies P[Xt = Y t] ≥1

2, since the minimum graph distance between x ̸= y is 1.

Our underlying metric space is (Rn, ∥· ∥2), however. Inequalities for this more general set-up have
been developed, but they often give weaker bounds. In our case, they lose a factor 1/(ηλq) ≳n in the
convergence rate. Morally, though, the exponential convergence at rate κ still implies that 1/κ is the
correct timescale for mixing and concentration, perhaps up to some logarithmic factors. Establishing
this rigorously is the most challenging part of our work from a technical point of view.

2.2
Comparison with Related Work

In this section, we compare the convergence rate of Elo given by Theorem 2.5 against the state of
the art for BTL estimation. We highlight, once again, that previous work focusses on the problem of
offline estimation, whilst Elo works in the more challenging online setting. Nevertheless, Elo is able
to match the state-of-the-art algorithms in the offline setting for a wide range of parameters.

Our results imply that Elo provides an estimator ˆρ of ρ with ∥ˆρ −ρ∥2
2 ≲e4M(log n)2/(λ2
qt) whp.
This matches, up to a log factor, the results by Hajek, Oh and Xu [20], who prove that the MLE
constrained on [−M, M]n∩{x ∈Rn | P

k xk = 0}, ρMLC, satisfies ∥ρMLC−ρ∥2
2 ≲e8M log n/(λ2
qt).
The dependency on λq has been improved by Shah, Balakrishnan and Bradley [37], who show
∥ρMLC −ρ∥2
2 ≲ne8M log n/(λqt). Since n/λq ≥1/4, this is at least as good as our result, and
potentially better for certain choices of q. However, up to log factors, our result matches theirs when
q corresponds to sampling edges of an expander graph—e.g., a complete graph, or an Erd˝os–Rényi
graph with parameter p ≫(log n)/n. Our result improves the constant in front of M.

More recently, Li, Shrotriya and Rinaldo [27] proved a regularised version of the MLE, ρMLR, achieves
∥ρMLR −ρ∥2
2 ≲e2MEδ/(λ2
qt), where δ is the ratio between the maximum and average degree of the
comparison graph G = ([n], E) with E = {{i, j} | qi,j > 0} and ME = maxi,j:qi,j>0 |ρi −ρj| ≤
2 maxk |ρk|. A version of our analysis also applies with ME, instead of M, but we are not able to
prove maxi,j:qi,j>0 |Xt
i −Xt
j| < ME + 1 holds for polynomially long. Notice that their result is
weaker when the comparison graph is relatively sparse but has a few high degree nodes. Moreover,
they require each player to play the same number of matches; i.e., qi,j = 1/|E| for {i, j} ∈E. Both
limitations are particularly problematic in the context of tournament design discussed in §3. On the
other hand, they obtain ℓ∞error bounds too. We refer to [27] for further discussion of previous work.

2.3
Outline of Proof

We now highlight the key steps in estimating the MCMC-type error 1

n∥At,T −ρ∥2
2 in Theorem 2.5,
where At,T is the t-step time average of the ratings X after a burn-in phase of length T. We use

∥At,T −ρ∥2 ≤∥At,T −Eπ[X0]∥2 + ∥Eπ[X0] −ρ∥2,

4


---Page Break---
bounding these error and bias terms separately, via Theorems 2.8 and 2.7, respectively. Their proofs
rely on estimating the change in ℓ2 norm a single step, and using the Lipschitz property of the sigmoid
function σ, along with some other careful manipulations. The full proofs are given in the appendix.

The primary challenge is to leverage the positive curvature result of Theorem 2.8 to deduce the
required concentration inequality in Theorem 2.5. As noted at the end of §2.1, positive curvature is
well-suited to this goal, but the specifics of our set-up cause significant difficulties. Particularly, the
aforementioned results reliant only on curvature are not sufficiently strong for our purposes.

A further complication is that Elo is a non-reversible Markov chain. There is a general understanding,
or perhaps belief, in the MCMC community that non-reversibility can improve concentration results.
This has lead to many strategies being proposed, such as non-backtracking, lifting, or zig-zag; see,
e.g., [14, 16, 30, 8, 25]. Even an alternative definition of the spectral gap has been proposed [13];
this gap controls convergence of empirical averages, rather than convergence to equilibrium.

Unfortunately, the majority of general concentration results based on spectral properties [19, 26,
35, 36] are actually worse in the non-reversible set-up: they bound the convergence rates by those
of the multiplicative or additive reversibilisation. These can be hard to estimate, needing detailed
knowledge of the equilibrium distribution, and the resulting bounds are often crude.

Finally, we mention that bounds on the total-variation mixing time can be leveraged to provide
concentration bounds; see, particularly, [15, 35]. However, Elo does not converge in total variation!
Indeed, Xt is finitely supported, on at most (2n)t states, given X0, but π is continuous. These (2n)t
states can be used to distinguish Xt and π. Nevertheless, it is this mixing-time approach that we adapt.

The contraction property implies that two realisations X and Y can be coupled so that their expected
relative distance decreases exponentially, with rate κ. This is ideal for using the coupling approach to
mixing. However, it is not possible to guarantee that Xt = Y t at some point, due to the chain’s finite
support. Instead, we analyse a noisy version: after each update, some (continuous) noise is added to
the ratings. This must be added carefully to preserve the contraction in Theorem 2.8.

Denote the noisy versions U and V . Once U and V are sufficiently close, the additive noise can be
used to couple them exactly, to get U t = V t. The size of the noise must be balanced: too small and
this final coupling step is too difficult; too big and U can no longer be compared with X.

We delve deeper into this noisy approximation, explaining what noise to add, how it accumulates and
what the resulting mixing time is. The interaction of the noise with the projection step is delicate and
technical; we omit it from the description here, but it should be kept in the back of the mind.

Noisy Version & Error. We consider the following noisy version U of the Elo process X. Let δ > 0.

1. Draw U t+1/2 according to an uncapped Elo step started from U t—i.e., as if M = ∞.
Suppose that Players i and j were chosen—i.e., {k | U t+1/2
k
̸= U t
k} = {i, j}.

2. Draw ˜Ui, ˜Uj ∼iid Unif([−
√

δ, +
√

δ]) independently and set ˜Uk := 0 for k /∈{i, j}. Set

U t+1
k
:= U t+1/2
k
+ ˜Uk
for
k ∈[n].

This does not preserve the zero-sum property, as the additive noise is independent. The independence
is crucial later to allow two version to coalesce. We need to control the cumulation until that point.

We control the difference between X and U via the natural coupling: pick the same pair of players to
play, and observe the same result; sample the noise independently. Careful computation gives

∥Xt+1 −U t+1∥1 ≤∥Xt+1/2 −U t+1/2∥1 + 2

δ ≤∥Xt −U t∥1 + 2

Curvature. We use the natural coupling between two noisy versions U and V : choose the same
players, observe the same result and add the same noise. Then, there is still rate-κ contraction:

Eu0,v0[∥U 1 −V 1∥2] ≤Eu0,v0[∥U 1/2 −V 1/2∥2] ≤(1 −κ)∥u0 −v0∥2.

Mixing Time. We bound the total-variation mixing time of the noisy chain via the coupling method:
 Pu0[U t ∈·] −Pv0[V t ∈·]

TV ≤P(u0,v0)[U t ̸= V t].

First, we burn-in using the natural coupling, then use a new coupling which exploits the noise.

We start with the natural coupling as given above. Using the rate-κ curvature,

E[∥U t −V t∥2] ≤(1 −κ)t∥U 0 −V 0∥2 ≤2Mne−κt ≤δ2
if
t ≥tδ := κ−1 log(2Mn/δ2).

Hence,
P[∥U t −V t∥∞> δ] ≤P[∥U t −V t∥2 > δ] ≤δ
if
t ≥tδ.

Once the absolute difference |U tδ
k −V tδ
k | are at most δ for all k, the additive noise, which is order
√

δ,
dominates the change in difference after a single Elo step, which is order δ. Thus, with complementary
probability order δ/
√

δ =
√

δ, we can couple the noise so that the rating of a player is the same in
both U and in V after they play a game. Moreover, such a successful step preserves the ℓ∞bound of δ.

The ℓ∞bound implies that all players are chosen within tδ steps with probability at least 1−δ. Hence,
the probability of not successfully matching all ratings after tδ steps is at most order δ +
√

δtδ.

Combining these two bounds gives a bound of order δ +
√

δtδ on the total-variation distance at
time 2tδ. The polynomial-growth/decay assumptions in the theorem allow us to choose δ to be an
appropriate inverse polynomial (in n) and obtain δ +
√

δtδ ≪1 and tδ ≍κ−1 log n ≍t⋆.

The above mixing-time bound allows us to establish concentration of time-averages of the noisy Elo
ratings, using results from [35]. Particularly, under certain assumptions, if Z is a Markov chain with
equilibrium distribution π and mixing time t⋆, then

f := Varπ[f]. Notice that this requires Z0 ∼π, which we do not impose;
this requirement can be circumnavigated by using a burn-in, again comparing with a noisy version.

We want to take f := fk to be the projection onto the k-th coordinate, which is the k-th player’s
rating, for each k, then do a union bound over the n players. This motivates taking

We are taking t to be polynomial in n, and can choose δ−1 to be a sufficiently large polynomial so
that this accumulated error is small. Care must be taken to to make all this rigorous, but once it is
done, we are able to deduce the concentration result for the original Elo process.

Our Results

In this section, we assume we are given a comparison graph G = ([n], E), where edge {i, j} ∈E
indicates that Players i and j are able to play against one another. We want to construct a distribution
q over edges E of G so that Elo can most efficiently approximate the true ratings of the players.

The decay rate in Theorem 2.5 is governed by the spectral gap λq. So, we want to maximise λq. Let

λ⋆
cts := sup

This equals the largest spectral gap achievable by a continuous-time Markov chain on [n] with
transitions only across edges of G and average jump-rate 1/n. It is the fastest-mixing Markov chain
problem, introduced by Sun et al. [39], and can be formulated as a semidefinite program. Olesker-
Taylor and Zanetti [32] recently proved that λ⋆
ctsn ≳1/(diam G)2. This implies the following.

set-up of Theorem 2.5, there exists a distribution q on the edges E such that

1
n∥At,T −ρ∥2
2 ≲n(diam G)2(log n)2/t
whp
if
η ≲n(diam G)2(log n)2/t.

This choice of probabilities q can improve drastically over uniform weights—as used by [27]. E.g., if
G consists of two cliques connected by k edges, then λqn ≲k/n2 when qe := 1/|E| is uniform over
E, whilst the optimal λ⋆
ctsn ≍1 [32]. As a consequence, with the optimal choice of q, only ˜O(n)
total matches need to be played to obtain a good approximation of the true ratings, compared with
˜O(n3/k) for a uniform q. Here, ˜O(·) indicates the asymptotic order up to logarithmic factors. This
demonstrates the power of being able to choose q, given G.

Elo naturally parallelises: if two games consist of disjoint pairs of players, then the Elo update
resulting from one is independent of the result of the other. Hence, if we wish to minimise the number
of rounds (i.e., sets of games that can be played in parallel), rather than games, we should consider a
distribution ˜q on the set M of matchings of the graph G = ([n], E)—i.e., collections of disjoint edges.
Definition 3.2 (Parallel Elo). Let ˜q be a distribution on M. A single step of ParEloM(˜q, ρ; η) first
selects a matching S ⊆E according to ˜q and applies the Elo update (with scale η) to each pair in S.
Then, the resulting vector is orthogonally projected back to zero-sum vectors in [−M, +M]n.

Our analysis is robust enough to handle the parallel case, obtaining convergence rate 1/(λqt), where
now qe is the marginal probability that edge e ∈E appears in the matching:

qe := P

S∈M:e∈S ˜qS.

Theorem 3.3 (Parallel). Let X ∼ParEloM(˜q, ρ; η). Then, under the conditions of Theorem 2.5,

1
n∥At,T −ρ∥2
2 ≲e4M(log n)2

λqn/N

λqt

if
η ≍(log n)2

λqt
,

where N := P

e∈E qe is the mean size of the matching. To emphasise, here, t and T count rounds.

Remark 3.4. It can be shown that this factor N is needed in the pre-factor via a time-change analysis.

It is natural to optimise λq over q which can arise as the marginals of a distribution ˜q on M. Clearly,

qk := P

e∈E:k∈e qe ≤1
for all
k ∈[n]

for any such q. Thus, the matrix Q = (qi,j)i,j∈V is substochastic, so λq corresponds to the spectral
gap of the discrete-time Markov chain on G = ([n], E) with weights qi,j = q{i,j}. Let

λ⋆
disc := sup{λq | q ∈[0, 1]E, maxk∈[n] qk ≤1}.

This is the optimal spectral gap of a discrete-time Markov chain on [n] with transitions allowed
only across edges of G and uniform stationary distribution. Again, λ⋆
disc can be formulated as a
semidefinite program [10] and is related to the vertex conductance via a Cheeger-type inequality [32].

We show that a distribution ˜q over matchings with λq ≥1

3λ⋆
disc can be found by decomposing the
substochastic Q into a convex combination of permutation matrices using the Birkhoff–von-Neumann
theorem, followed by decomposing each permutation into disjoint cycles.
Corollary 3.5 (Optimised ˜q). Suppose that the comparison graph G = ([n], E) is given. In the
set-up of Theorem 3.3, there exists a distribution ˜q on matchings M such that

1
n∥At,T −ρ∥2
2 ≲e4M(log n)2

λ⋆
discn/N
1
λ⋆
disct
whp
if
η ≍(log n)2

λ⋆
disct .

In many examples, such as if G = ([n], E) is an expander, but also if G is a cycle, then λ⋆
disc ≍nλ⋆
cts.
In this case, parallel Elo really is as good, up to constants, as n steps of the original (‘series’) Elo.
(Recall that N = P

e qe = 1 is required for λ⋆
cts, but that N ≍n is possible for λ⋆
disc.)

Other times, there is already a continuous-time chain, with average jump-rate 1, which has spectral
gap order 1; e.g., two cliques connected by a single edge. In this case, the optimal parallel version
gives no real improvement, even measured by rounds, over the optimally weighted series version.

Comparison with Related Work

The problem of designing an efficient tournament graph is related to active ranking [21]. Active
ranking, however, allows one to choose which matches to schedule next after observing the results of
some matches. For example, Yan et al. [40] propose an algorithm to identify the most informative
pair of players given previous outcomes, and obtain regret bounds between Elo and the true ratings
when matchups are scheduled according to their algorithm. In contrast, we are interested in designing
a probability distribution over matches in an offline manner, without the possibility of changing such
distribution after observing some results.

This problem has been considered by Li, Shrotriya and Rinaldo [27]. They discuss a divide-and-
conquer strategy that essentially requires oversampling edges across bottlenecks in the graph. The
drawback of this strategy is that it requires partitioning the graph into well-connected pieces, which is
a non-trivial task itself. Furthermore, [27] does not provide explicit bounds on the sample complexity
that can be obtained in this way, besides discussing a few examples where the bottleneck is known.

Nonetheless, our approach shares some similarity with [27]: the fastest-mixing Markov chain
implicitly up-weights edges across bottlenecks. The main advantage, however, is that it provides
the optimal spectral gap allowed by a graph topology, which is related to the diameter of the
graph [32]. Moreover, both λ⋆
cts and λ⋆
disc can be formulated as SDPs, for which fast (polynomial-
time) solvers exist. We remark, however, that this construction might require certain nodes to play an
overwhelmingly large number of matches: this would be problematic for the results of [27]. As far as
we know, minimising the number of ‘parallel rounds’ has not been considered before.

Experimental Results

We close with discussion of some specific examples and experimental results. Additional experiments
are discussed in the Appendix. We start by considering dumbbell tournament graphs consisting of
two cliques of n/2 = 20 vertices connected by a matching of k ∈{1, 20} edges. For each graph,
we perform Elo simulations where the match-ups between players are sampled according to the
following probability distributions.

1. The uniform distribution qU over the edges of the graph.
2. The optimal sequential q⋆
seq derived from the fastest-mixing continuous-time Markov chain.
3. The distribution over matchings q⋆
par derived from the fastest mixing discrete-time Markov
chain, where multiple games are played in parallel in each round.

From §3, we know that λqU ≍k/n3, λq⋆seq ≍1/n and λq⋆par ≍k/n.

We sample the true ratings of the players according to independent Gaussians, with mean equal to
1 on one clique, mean 2 on the other, and standard deviation equal to 0.2 in both. This difference
in average ratings between cliques simulates a scenario where the two cliques correspond to two
different leagues of slightly different strength on average.

We perform Elo simulations initialising the Elo ratings at zero and setting η = 0.1. For each graph,
we repeat each experiment ten times, each time sampling new true ratings. Experimental results are
displayed in Figures 1 and 2. Simulations are repeated ten times: lines correspond to the average
ℓ2
2-distance between time-averaged Elo ratings and the true ratings, divided by the number of players
(n = 40). Shaded regions corresponds to 25–75 percentile over these ten trials. Cyan and blue lines
correspond to the same experiments where we have sampled multiple games in parallel as described
in §3; we display the decay of error wrt the total number of games played in cyan and wrt the number
of parallel rounds in blue. The blue line is solid for the first 2 · 104 games (same number of games
displayed in cyan).

We display the experimental results for k = 1, i.e., two cliques of 20 vertices connected by a single
edge, in Figure 1. The experiments align with the theoretical results of §3: when k = 1, the spectral
gap λq⋆
seq of the optimal sequential distribution is of the same order of the spectral gap for our nearly
parallel construction λq⋆
par. Indeed, if convergence is measured wrt the number of rounds, the two
corresponding errors seems to decay at a similar same rate, with the parallel version being slightly
better, but requiring more than ten times the total number of games. As predicted by the theory, both
distributions result in much faster convergence than the uniform distribution. If we measure the total

number of games rather than rounds, the parallel version still results in a faster convergence than the
uniform distribution, but not overwhelmingly so.

We now consider a dumbbell graph with k = n/2, i.e., two cliques connected by a perfect matching.
In this case, the fastest discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains have the same order-1 spectral
gap. However, since the spectral gap for sequential Elo is then rescaled by a factor of 1/n, to achieve
convergence, we expect the number of rounds for the parallel version to be much smaller than the
number of games required by the sequential one; convergence should instead happen at the same
rate when measured in the total number of games. This is clearly shown in Figure 2. The uniform
distribution performs much worse, which we would expect from its order-1/n2 spectral gap. In the
optimal parallel and sequential distributions, the probability to sample an edge from the bottleneck
or from inside the cliques is balanced, while the uniform distribution oversamples edges inside the
cliques. Experiments for the intermediate case of k ∈{5, 10} are discussed in the Appendix.

Figure 3: Largest Elo rating in absolute value for
a complete graph of varying size. True ratings
are uniformly distributed in [−1, 1].

We end this section by discussing experimental
results concerning the maximum rating reached
by Elo. Figure 3 displays the behaviour of the
largest Elo rating in absolute value, where pairs
of players are selected uniformly at random (i.e.,
the underlying graph is a complete graph). The
true ratings are sampled uniformly at random in
[−1, 1]. The initial Elo ratings are set equal to
zero. We simulate up to 50000 matches for a
number of players that goes from 100 to 1000.
We observe that the maximum rating is always
below 1.75, corroborating our belief that, in many
scenarios, the maximum Elo rating does not di-
verge for a long time. Further experiments and
discussions are given in the Appendix.

Conclusion and Open Problems

Our work is a first step towards establishing the theoretical foundations of the Elo rating system, a
popular ranking method in sports analytics. In particular, our main contribution is an analysis of Elo
under the BTL model, establishing convergence results competitive with the state of the art.

There are several questions prompted by our work. First, from a technical point of view, we would
like to control the maximal Elo rating. This is necessary to understand when we can remove the
projection step in our definition of the Elo Markov chain, and make our theoretical results more
aligned with practice.

---Page Break---
Moreover, we would like to better understand the shape of the stationary distribution of Elo. This
could help us, for example, obtain bounds on the rate of convergence in ℓ∞.

Finally, a touted strength of the Elo rating system in practical applications is its ability to dynamically
update the ratings in response to changes in players’ skills. Can we model these changes in a way
that allows us to prove Elo can keep track of them, and bound the corresponding mean squared error?
Such questions are often studied in the statistics literature; see, e.g., the recent paper [18] for details.

Experiments: Further Discussion and Figures

In this appendix we discuss additional experimental results. Code for our experiments is included in
the supplementary material.

In Figure 4 we display further experiments related to dumbbell graphs. In particular, we consider
graphs consisting of two cliques of 20 vertices connected by 5 (left) and 10 (right) edges arranged in a
matching. The experimental setup is the same as the one discussed in §4. Notice how, the more edges
are added to the bottleneck, the better the distribution optimised for parallel rounds performs. The
optimal sequential distribution, instead, performs roughly the same: adding edges in the bottleneck
doesn’t really improve its spectral gap, which depends mainly on the (unchanged) diameter.

Figure 4: Elo simulation results for dumbbell graphs with k = 5 (left) and k = 10 (right) edges
between two cliques of 20 vertices.

We also consider a pyramidal graph, which is constructed as follows. We first sample three Erd˝os–
Rényi random graphs with size, resp., n1 = 64, n2 = 32 and n3 = 16, and density p = 1/2. We then
connect the first graph to the second and the second to the third with two sparse cuts (see Figure 5).
This graph is constructed to loosely resemble the pyramidal structure of, e.g., national sport leagues.

We conduct Elo simulations with the same set-up as for dumbbell graphs discussed earlier. In
particular, we repeat the simulations ten times, resampling each time the players’ true ratings. The
true ratings are sampled as follows: independent normal distributions of standard deviation 0.2 and
mean 0 for the Erd˝os–Rényi at the bottom of the pyramid, mean 1 for the Erd˝os–Rényi in the middle,

Figure 5: Schematic representation of the pyra-
midal graph.

Figure 6: Elo simulation results for the pyramidal
graph.

13


---Page Break---
and mean 2 for the one at the top. This is, again, to loosely simulate the fact that sport leagues are
characterised by stronger players/teams towards the top of the pyramid. Experimental results are
shown in Figure 6. In particular, we observe that the rate of converge for the uniform distribution is
much slower than for the optimal sequential one. This is, again, predicted by the results of §3: the two
bottlenecks slow down the convergence in the uniform case; while the small diameter assures faster
convergence for the optimal distribution by Corollary 3.1. The distribution optimised for parallel Elo,
instead, guarantees very fast convergence when measured according to the number of rounds.

In Figure 7 we display experimental results for a topology corresponding to the giant component of
an Erd˝os–Rényi random graph of n = 100 vertices and density p = 0.02. True ratings are distributed
as independent standard Gaussians. This graph has reasonably good connectivity, so we expect
the number of games required to converge to be roughly equal for all the sampling distributions
considered, with a good scope for parallelisation. This is confirmed by the error plot. What is perhaps
surprising is that the optimal sequential distribution actually performs slightly worse than the uniform
one. This can be explained by the fact that the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence for
the worst possible vector of ratings: if the ratings do not depend on the topology of the graph, like
in this example, the inverse of the spectral gap is an overtly pessimistic upper bound. Indeed, the
optimal sequential distribution tends to oversample nodes that are in a central position in the graph
and undersample nodes at the periphery. This should make convergence faster because it allows faster
movement of information between distant nodes, but in this specific example is not helpful: since
ratings are sampled in a iid fashion, the faster movement of information globally is not very helpful
and is upset by slower convergence for undersampled nodes.

Figure 7: Left: topology of the giant component of an Erd˝os–Rényi random graph of n = 100
vertices and density p = 0.02; edges are reweighed according to the distribution corresponding to the
fastest mixing continuous-time Markov chain. Right: Elo simulation results for the same graph.

We now present further experiments about the maximum Elo rating (in absolute value). Again, we
sample true ratings independently and uniformly in [−1, 1]. In Figure 8, we present experiments for a
path (left) and star (right) topology of varying size. In both cases, the largest Elo rating in absolute
value remains smaller than twice the largest true rating. Notice that in the star graph the central node
plays all the matches; this means the same player plays in total fifty-thousands matches without its
value becoming particularly large.

Of course, these simulations are far from definitive: there are countless of ways in which to choose
the true ratings and the graph topology. Our belief that these experiments are indicative of a more
general behaviour is due to the peculiarities of the Elo rating systems. In particular, the Elo update
offers diminishing returns: if the rating of i is relatively much larger than the rating of j, if i wins
against j, the rating of i won’t increase by much. This is because the sigmoid function σ approaches
zero very fast.

Despite this, proving that the maximum rating cannot increase significantly appears much harder.
This is due to the fact that the maximum rating is not a supermartingale: if all of the neighbours of
the node i with largest true rating have abnormally large rating, the rating of i is likely to increase,
no matter how large it already was. However, because the zero-sum property of the ratings, the
neighbours of i cannot maintain an abnormally large rating for too long. Indeed, it appears very
unlikely that such balanced but “abnormal” configurations are ever reached.

Figure 8: Behaviour of the largest Elo rating in absolute value for path (left) and star (right) graphs of
varying size.

In the two-player case, the situation is simpler: if player 1 has Elo rating x1, then player 2 has
x2 = −x1, by the zero-sum nature. It is straightforward to check that the Elo ratings are biased
towards the true skills: that is, if player 1 has rating x1 before a game, then their rating x′
1 after the
game has E[|x′
1 −ρ1|] < |x1 −ρ1|, if η < 1

2.

Suppose that the same argument holds for n > 2 players: i.e., typically, Elo ratings are biased towards
the true skills. Biased random walks on R have exponential tails. So, if η ≪1/ log n, then it is
super-polynomially unlikely that a given Elo rating will be more than 1 away from the corresponding
true skill, in equilibrium. A union bound over the n players allows us to deduce that the maximum
Elo rating is at most 1 more than the maximum true skill, with probability at least 1 −1/n10.

Unfortunately, we weren’t able to make this argument formal for n > 2 players. We leave proving
that indeed, with high probability, the maximum rating remains small for a large number of steps as
an open problem.

Convergence Proofs: Preliminaries

There are a few results which we use repeatedly throughout the proofs. We collect them here.

Dirichlet Characterisation of the Spectral Gap

Recall that λq is the spectral gap of the continuous-time Markov chain on [n] with transition rates
(qi,j)i,j∈[n]. We repeatedly use the standard Dirichlet characterisation of the spectral gap.

Capping the Ratings

Capping at ±M has the benefit of restricting the process remains in a compact set. The disadvantage,
though, is that the Elo update is more complicated. It also biases the process compared with the
original. However, as we discuss in Remark C.2 below, the original process is already biased in the
sense that the expected rating in equilibrium is not the true rating: Eπ[X] ̸= ρ.

The only property of the projection that we use is the following monotonicity result.
Proposition B.3 (Projection Monotonicity). Let Ω⊆Rn be a closed, convex set. Define

ΠΩ(x) := arg minx′∈Ω∥x −x′∥2
for
x ∈Rn;

that is, ΠΩis the orthogonal projection to Ω. Then,

∥ΠΩ(x) −ΠΩ(y)∥2 ≤∥x −y∥2
for all
x, y ∈Rn;

that is, ΠΩ(x) is at least as close to ΠΩ(y) as x is to y, in ℓ2.

Versions of this result are well-known. An elementary proof can be found at [29]. We apply this
with Ω:= {x ∈Rn | ∥x∥∞≤M, P
k xk = 0}, which is convex. Our results apply whenever this
monotonicity property holds.

The orthogonal projection ΠΩ(x) can be efficiently computed as follows. We first project x to
{y ∈Rn | ∥y∥∞≤M}. This can be done by simply replacing any xi < −M with −M and any
xi > M with M. Let x′ be the resulting vector. Notice that x′ might not satisfy the constraint
P

k x′
k = 0: we need to subtract the displaced mass P

k x′
k to the rest of the vector while minimising
ΠΩ(x) := arg minx′′∈Ω∥x −x′′∥2. Assume P
k x′
k > 0 (the symmetric case can be handled
similarly). We set x′′
i = −M for all the coordinates i such that x′
i = −M and call i frozen. To
minimise ∥x −x′′∥2, we want to distribute −P

k x′
k to the unfrozen coordinates so that x −x′′ is as
balanced as possible in each coordinate (this can be imagined as a water-filling procedure). In doing
so, however, we might make x′′
i = −M for a new, previously unfrozen, coordinate i before we have
subtracted all the displaced mass. If that happens, we simply freeze i and proceed in distributing the
remaining displaced mass to the unfrozen coordinates (until a new coordinate is frozen). We keep
repeating the procedure since all the mass is allocated. Notice that we can allocate all the mass since
we assumed P

k x′
k > 0. Moreover, the procedure lasts at most n steps since at each step we freeze a
new coordinate until we have completed constructing the desired vector.

Convergence Proofs: Bias and Variance

There is an inherent bias and variance in the Elo ratings. It would be natural to assume that the
expected value of a player’s rating in equilibrium is equal to their real skill. After all, at least in the
two-player case, an individual step is always biased towards the real skill. However, even for two
players, this is not true. In this section, we quantify the bias and the variance in equilibrium.

Throughout this section and the next, we denote

pi,j(z) := σ(zi −zj)
for
z ∈Rn
and
i, j ∈[n].

In particular, pi,j(ρ) is the true probability that Player i beats j and pi,j(x) is the model probability if
the current ratings are x. Additionally, we split up the Elo step into the update and the projection:

• if the current vector is Xt, then let Xt+1/2 denote an uncapped step;

• then, Xt+1 = ΠM(Xt+1/2), where ΠM is the orthogonal projection.

We do not quantify the bias and variance player-by-player, but rather average over all players.
Theorem C.1 (Bias and Variance; Theorem 2.7). The following bias and variance estimates hold:

∥Eπ[X0] −ρ∥2
2 ≤Eπ[∥X0 −ρ∥2
2] ≤4e4Mη/λq;
P

k Varπ[X0
k] = Eπ[∥X0 −Eπ[X0]∥2
2] ≤4e2Mη/λq.

Proof: Bias. First and foremost, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives

∥Eπ[X0] −ρ∥2
2 ≤Eπ[∥X0 −ρ∥2
2].

---Page Break---
We start the system from equilibrium and use stationarity: X0 ∼π =⇒X1 ∼π. Also, we can
ignore the projection step, whilst still assuming that all vectors have ℓ∞norm at most M, due to the
projection monotonicity of Proposition B.3: noting that ∥ρ∥∞≤M, so ΠM(ρ) = ρ, we have

∥X1 −ρ∥2 = ∥ΠM(X1/2) −πM(ρ)∥2 ≤∥X1/2 −ρ∥2.

We perform a very similar calculation when bounding the curvature; see Definition D.2. This is the
exponential contraction rate between a pair of systems X and Y . The (1 −1

2e−4Mηλq)-factor above
suggests curvature κ ≍e−4Mηλq, which is indeed what we show in Proposition D.4.

We now turn to the variance, for which we use a similar approach. It is a little more technically
challenging, using the slightly cumbersome law of total variance: for random variables A and B,

Var[B] = E[Var[B | A]] + Var[E[B | A]].

for any random variable Z ∈Rn. Also, for any c ∈Rn,

Hence, it suffices to prove the bound for X1/2—i.e., for the Elo update without capping.

Use subscript {i, j} to indicate that this pair is chosen in the first game, as before. Let {I, J} be a
pair of (distinct) indices drawn according to q. Then, by the law of total variance,
P

k Var[X1/2

k E[Var{I,J}[X1/2

The right-hand side is the expectation of the estimated probability that Player i wins their next game
(not conditioning on their opponent) in equilibrium and the left-hand side is the true probability. The
equality shows that the win-probability estimator for each player is unbiased.

In the two-player case, this actually implies that Eπ[p1,2(X)] = p1,2(ρ). We can deduce from this,
however, that the estimated rating is biased, if ρ ̸= (0, 0). We do this now, but only informally.

The ratings are zero-sum, so it suffices to consider X1 and ρ1. Suppose that ρ1 > 0 and that η is
small—much smaller than ρ1. Then, the rating X1 concentrates around ρ1. The win-probability
function σ is strictly convex and increasing in (0, ∞), which suggests that

p1,2

Eπ[X1]

< Eπ

p1,2(X1)

= p1,2(ρ),
and hence
Eπ[X1] ̸= ρ.

Of course, Pπ[X1 > 0] ̸= 1. This can be handled using the quantified version of Jensen’s inequality
and large deviation estimates on Pπ[X1 < 0]. If ρ1 is large, then, very roughly, the latter probability
is like e−ρ2
1, whilst the quantified difference from equality is like e−ρ1; the latter dominates.

The n-player case is more complicated. It is possible that a particular choice of (ρ, q) could lead to
certain players’ having unbiased estimates. However, they will be biased in general.

The ratings are biased, typically, but the win-probabilities at equilibrium are unbiased in the uncapped
setting. Moreover, the real ratings are the only vector ρ giving rise to these win-probabilities.
Proposition C.3. Let x, ρ ∈Rn with P

1. it has a unique minimum at ρ;

Notice that if we only desire estimates on the win-probabilities, then the whole Elo framework is
not needed: simply tracking the empirical proportion of games won between each pair of players suf-

Convergence Proofs: Curvature and Concentration

Our time-averaged MCMC-type concentration estimates rely crucially on curvature bounds. We start
by introducing curvature, then bounding it in the case of the Elo ratings. We then apply it to obtain
concentration results for time-averaged ratings.

Curvature Definitions

We introduce the concept of curvature for a Markov chain P on a general metric space (Ω, d).

portation distance W1(µ, π) represents the ‘best’ way to send µ to π so that, on average, points are
moved by the smallest distance:

W1(µ, π) := infQ EQ

d(X, Y )

,

where the infimum is over all couplings Q of (µ, π)—i.e., X ∼µ and Y ∼π, marginally, under Q.
Definition D.2 (Curvature of Markov Chains). The (Ricci) curvature of P is

κP := infx,y∈Ωκx,y
where
κx,y := 1 −W1(Px,·, Py,·)/d(x, y)
for
x, y ∈Ω.

A standard application of the triangle inequality and iteration establishing the following result.
Lemma D.3 (Contraction of Distance). For all measures µ and π and all t ≥0,

W1(µP, πP) ≤(1 −κP )W1(µ, π)
and
W1(µP t, πP t) ≤(1 −κP )tW1(µ, π).

This reduces to the well-known set-up of path coupling [12] when (Ω, d) is a finite graph endowed
with the usual graph distance. Our set-up, however, is very different: (Ω, d) = (Rn, ∥· ∥2).

Exact calculation of the curvature is rarely required. Rather, a particular coupling is analysed, giving
an upper bound on the transportation distance and hence, by extension, an upper bound on the
curvature. The key is finding as close to optimal a coupling as possible.

The next subsection establishes an upper bound on the curvature of the Elo process. The final
subsection of the section develops applies curvature to concentration.

Curvature Bounds for the Elo Process

We determine the worst-case rate of contraction rate 1 −κ starting from ratings (x, y) ∈Ω2: we
show that κ ≳λq where λq is the spectral gap of the auxiliary random walk with rates (qi,j).
Proposition D.4 (Curvature). Let κ denote the curvature of Elo in ∥· ∥2. Then,

κ ≥1

8ηe−2Mλq.

Proof. Let x = (xk)k∈[n] ∈Ωand y = (yk)k∈[n] ∈Ωbe two sets of ratings. We want to bound

Ex,y[∥X1 −Y 1∥2] ≤(1 −ρ)∥x −y∥2
for some
ρ ≥0
under some coupling.
First, we observe that we can ignore the projection step in the Elo update, by Proposition B.3:

∥X1 −Y 1∥2 = ∥ΠM(X1/2) −ΠM(Y 1/2)∥2 ≤∥X1/2 −Y 1/2∥2.
Again, this is using the notation X1/2 to indicate the uncapped Elo update, and X1 = ΠM(X1/2).
We thus study (X1/2, Y 1/2), under the assumption ∥x∥∞, ∥y∥∞≤M. We use the trivial coupling:

• the same pair (I, J) of players is chosen;
• the result of the match is the same—i.e., the same player wins—in both systems.

This is legitimate because neither the choice of players nor the law of the outcome depends on the
current state—the estimated probability that I beats J depends on the state, but the real probability
does not. Write E{i,j}[·] for the law conditional on choosing pair {i, j} to play.

Recall that, for z ∈Rn and i, j ∈[n], we write pi,j(z) := σ(zj −zi) for the estimated probability
that i beats j using ratings z. If Player i beats j, then i gains ηpj,i points; similarly, i loses ηpj,i
points if Player j beats i. Observing that pj,i(x) −pj,i(y) = pi,j(y) −pi,j(x), we obtain

Concentration Statements

Our goal is to establish concentration of time-averaged statistics of the Elo process. General results of
this form as known as “Chernoff-type bounds for Markov chains”. There is a great deal of literature
on such concentration bounds. The version we state here is most-closely related to Theorem 3.4 and
Proposition 3.4 in [35]; see also Theorem 3 in [15], particularly.
Definition D.5 (Mixing Time). Let µ and π be measures on a state space Ω. Then, the total-variation
(TV) distance between µ and π is defined to be
∥µ −π∥TV := supA |µ(A) −π(A)|,
where the supremum is over measurable subsets of Ω. Let X = (Xt)t≥0 be a Markov chain on Ω,
and let π denote its equilibrium distribution. The (precision-ε) mixing time is
tmix(ε) := inf{t ≥0 | maxx∈Ω∥Px[Xt ∈·] −π∥TV ≤ε}.
By convention, we abbreviate tmix := tmix( 1

4).
Theorem D.6 (Concentration). Let X = (Xt)t≥0 be a uniformly ergodic, irreducible Markov chain
on a state space Ω, started from its equilibrium distribution π. Let tmix denote its 1

4-mixing time.

Let f : Ω→R be a bounded function: ∥f∥∞< ∞. Let π(f) := Eπ[f] =
R

Ωfdπ and σ2
f :=
Varπ[f] =
R

Ω(f −π(f))2dπ denote the mean and variance, respectively, of f under π.

Let ζ > 0 and t ≥0 be an integer. Then,

Remark D.7 (Connection to Curvature). The following description applies to finite state spaces Ω;
we have to be more careful in our Elo application later, since that state space is uncountably infinite.

It is well known that curvature bounds the spectral gap λ and relaxation time trel = 1/λ in the
reversible case: λ ≥κ, and hence trel = 1/λ ≤κ−1. However, it also upper-bounds the mixing time
without requiring reversibility, with an additional factor depending on the diameter:
tmix(ε) ≤κ−1 
log diam Ω+ log(1/ε)

,

assuming that d(x, y) ≥1{x ̸= y}. The argument for this is straight-forward: briefly,

P[Xt ̸= Yt] = E[1{Xt ̸= Yt}] ≤E[d(Xt, Yt)] ≤(1 −κ)td(X0, Y0) ≤e−κt diam Ω,
then use the standard TV–coupling relation. This can then be plugged into the previous concentration
bound, obtaining exponential decay in κt/ log diam Ω.

Applying the theorem to the Elo process has a number of complications, primarily that it does not
have a finite mixing time: given the initial ratings, it is always supported on a certain countable
set; thus, its TV distance to equilibrium, which is continuously-supported, is 1 (maximal). We
circumnavigate this by introducing a noisy version in the proof. This is detailed later.
Theorem D.8 (MCMC Convergence of Time Averages). Let f : Rn →R be a 1-Lipschitz function
and ζ ∈(0, 1). Let µf := Eπ[f] and σ2
f := Varπ[f] denote, respectively, its mean and variance under
π, the unique invariant distribution of X. For t, T > 0, denote the time average of f in [T, T + t −1]

Remark D.9 (Convergence Rate). If X1, X2, ... were iid, then we would have 1/
√

t decay. Chernoff
bounds for reversible Markov chains require t to be replaced by λt, where λ is the spectral gap.
The idea is that trel = 1/λ steps of the Markov chain are required to decorrelate terms when near
equilibrium. For non-reversible Markov chains, running for t⋆does the job.

Connecting this to the curvature κ, roughly, t⋆≲κ−1 log diam Ωif κ > 0; see Remark D.7. The Elo
process is not reversible and we, in essence, bound t⋆≲κ−1 log n and κ ≍ηλq.

D.4
Concentration Proofs

Remark D.7 connects curvature and the mixing time for finite Markov chains: in essence, curvature
allows us to bring two copies exactly together. The Elo process, which lives in the continuum Rn,
does not have this property. We can get them extremely close, though. So, morally, the bound of
κ−1 log diam Ω≍λ−1
q
log n on ‘mixing’ suggested by curvature feels correct.

We rigorise this idea by adding a small amount of independent noise to the ratings after every step.
This noise is then used to couple the two copies once they are extremely close.

Outline of Proof of Theorem D.8. The proof has multiple steps, which we outline now.

I Approximate the Elo process by a noisy version and control the error.
II Check that the curvature of the noisy process is at least as good as the original.
III Control the mixing time, and hence concentration, of the noisy process.
IV Use a burn-in to get the process quantitatively close to equilibrium.

V Compare the equilibrium distributions for the original and noisy versions.

Finally, we bring all the piece together to conclude the proof, checking a variety of conditions.
△

We approximate the Elo process by a noisy version. This circumnavigates issues surrounding the
discrete support of Xt versus the continuous support of its equilibrium distribution.

All the statements consist of generic constants C0, C1, C2 < ∞. Rather than carry all these depen-
dencies, we make the specific (arbitrary) choice C1 := 5 and exhibit a C2 for which this works. The
results can easily be extended to the general set-up, albeit with more notation. With this in mind, let
δ := n−24.

Step I: Noisy Version & Error. We consider the following noisy version U of the Elo process X.

1. Suppose U 0 = u0. Draw u1/3 according to an uncapped Elo step—i.e., as if M = ∞—
started from u0. Suppose Players i and j were chosen—i.e., {k ∈[n] | u1/3
k
̸= u0
k} = {i, j}.

2. Draw ˜ui, ˜uj ∼iid Unif([−
√

δ, +
√

δ]) independently of all else and set ˜uk := 0 for k /∈
{i, j}. Set
u2/3 := u1/3 + ˜u.

3. Define U 1 := u1 by orthogonally projecting u2/3 to [−M, M]n preserving the sum.

Note that this does not preserve the zero-sum property, as ˜ui ̸= ˜uj. We see later, though, that it is
important—crucial, even— for these additive noise terms to be taken independently.

We must control the error between the noisy and original versions. To do this, we use the trivial
coupling, as before: the same players and result is used. The error does not accumulate super-linearly
due to the contractive nature of the Elo update step, as we explain now.

Suppose that (X0, Y 0) = (x, y) and generate (X1, Y 1) = (x′, y′) from a single step of the trivial
Elo-update coupling. Suppose that Players i and j play. Let s ∈{0, 1} be the indicator that Player i
beats j—the ‘score’. Then,

and

Subtracting the second from the first gives

Analogously,

 
pi,j(x) −pi,j(y)

.

But, pi,j(z) = σ(zi −zj) and σ is 1-Lipschitz, so

xi −xj ≤yi −yj
if and only if
pi,j(x) ≤pi,j(y)

and
|pi,j(x) −pi,j(y)| ≤|(xi −xj) −(yi −yj)| = |(xi −yi) −(xj −yj)|;

also, η ≤1

2. Hence,

|(x′
i −y′
i) −(x′
j −y′
j)| ≤|(xi −yi) −(xj −yj)| ≤|xi −yi| + |xj −yj|.

Also, trivially,

|(x′
i −y′
i) + (x′
j −y′
j)| = |(xi −yi) + (xj −yj)| ≤|xi −yi| + |xj −yj|,

since the Elo update is zero-sum. Combining these bounds,

|x′
i −y′
i|+|x′
j −y′
j| = max

|(x′

j −y′
j)|, |(x′
i −y′
i)+(x′
j −y′
j)|
	
≤|xi −yi|+|xj −yj|.

In other words, an Elo update does not increase the ℓ1 distance between the two sets of ratings:

∥x′ −y′∥1 ≤∥x −y∥1.

This actually immediately implies that the Elo process is non-negatively curved in ℓ1.

A consequences of this is that that error can only arise from the additive-noise step:

∥Xs −U s∥1 ≤∥Xs−1/2 −U s−1/2∥1 ≤∥Xs−1 −U s−1∥1 +

deterministically.
(I)

We can now work with the noisy version U, rather than the original version X. The key statistic for
our analysis is the curvature. This is not hurt by adding noise.

Step II: Curvature. We use the same coupling as before and the same noise in each process.

(i) Suppose that (U 0, V 0) = (u0, v0). Draw (u1/3, v1/3) according to a single step of the
trivial Elo coupling started from (u0, v0). Suppose that Players i and j were chosen.

(ii) Draw a single noise vector n—i.e., ˜ui, ˜uj ∼iid Unif([−
√

δ, +
√

δ]) and ˜uk := 0 for k /∈
{i, j}. Set
u2/3 := u1/3 + ˜u
and
v2/3 := v1/3 + ˜u.

(iii) Define U 1 := u1 and V 1 := v1 by projecting to [−M, M]n preserving the respective sums.

We have already shown that the trivial Elo coupling contracts. The added noise does not hurt:

∥u1 −v1∥2 ≤∥u2/3 −v2/3∥2 ≤∥u1/3 −v1/3∥2.

Hence, the two-stage coupling contracts at least as well as the original, completing Step II:

E[∥U 1 −V 1∥2] ≤E[∥U 1/3 −V 1/3∥2] ≤(1 −κ)∥U 0 −V 0∥2.
(II)

The reason for adding the noise is to be able to couple two systems U and V , and hence bound the
mixing time. We can then apply the general concentration result of Theorem D.6.

Step III: Mixing Time. Suppose that (U 0, V 0) = (u0, v0) with ∥u0 −v0∥∞≤δ. From this point,
we proceed via a slightly different coupling, replacing (i, ii, iii) with (i′, ii′, iii′), defined below.

(i′) Suppose that (U 0, V 0) = (u0, v0). Draw (u1/3, v1/3) according to a single step of the

u2/3 := u1/3 + ˜u
and
v2/3 := v1/3 + ˜v.

(iii′) Set U 1 := u1 := ΠM(u2/3) and V 1 := v1 := ΠM(v2/3).

If ∥u0 −v0∥∞≤δ and Players i and j play, leading to (u1/3, v1/3) under the Elo coupling, then

Say that a step is successful if this holds and fails otherwise. The probability of failure is at most
6
√

δ. If it succeeds, then Players i and j are coupled and the bound of δ on the ℓ∞norm is preserved.

We now iterate. Suppose that ∥U 0 −V 0∥∞≤δ. and Players it and jt are chosen in step t. Let

τc := inf

t ≥0
 ∪s≤t{it, jt} = [n]
	

be the first time that all players have been chosen. If all the first τc steps are successful, then all
players’ ratings are coupled. Call this event C; then, P[C | τc ≤t] ≥1 −6
√

δt.

It remains to analyse two times:

• the ‘burn-in’ time τb to get to ℓ∞norm at most δ, using coupling (i, ii, iii);
• the remaining ‘coupling time’ τc started after the burn in, using coupling (i′, ii′, iii′).

The first is easy to handle using curvature:

E[∥U t −V t∥∞] ≤E[∥U t −V t∥2] ≤e−κt∥U 0 −V 0∥2 ≤e−κt · 2Mn.

Thus,

P[τb > t] ≤P[∥U t −V t∥∞> δ] ≤E[∥U t −V t∥∞]/δ ≤δ
if
t ≥tδ := κ−1 log(2Mn/δ2).

The second is equally easy. Start with (U 0, V 0) such that |U 0
i −V 0
i | ≥1 for all i. Now, if
∥U t −V t∥∞≤δ < 1, then all players must have been chosen. Hence,

P[τc > t | C] ≤P[∥U t −V t∥∞> δ] ≤δ
if
t ≥tδ = κ−1 log(2Mn/δ2).

Let τ := inf{t ≥0 | U t = V t} denote the coalesce time. Putting the above parts together,

(III)

The general concentration result of Theorem D.6 applies only for a Markov chain started from
equilibrium. We start another chain V from equilibrium and use a burn-in to get U and V close,
quantified by curvature. The error between the time-averaged U- and V -sums is then small.

---Page Break---
Step IV: Burn-In. Let V be a noisy Elo process, started from its equilibrium distribution—which will
differ from π slightly. Under the above coupling, which has contraction rate 1 −κ by (II),

Step V: Equilibrium Distributions. The original and noisy Elo processes have different equilibrium
distributions; call them π and ˜π, respectively. Let Y and V be an original, respectively noisy, Elo
process started from π, respectively ˜π. Then, by the strong law of large numbers,

|π(f) −˜π(f)| = lim

In the curvature proof, we showed a ℓ2
2-contraction of 1 −2κ for the Elo process; see Proposition D.4.
Adding the noise can increase the ℓ2 distance squared by at most 10M
√

δ. Hence,

dℓ:= E[∥Y ℓ−V ℓ∥2

satisfies
dℓ≤(1 −2κ)dℓ−1 + 10M

Plugging this in above, for a 1-Lipschitz function f, using ∥· ∥1 ≤√n∥· ∥2, we obtain

|π(f) −˜π(f)| ≤δ1/4(10Mn/κ)1/2.

Finally, we observe that 10Mn/κ ≤n7, completing Step V:

|π(f) −˜π(f)| ≤n7/2δ1/4 = n−5/2.
(V)

We bring the previous give steps together to conclude the proof.

Conclusion of Proof of Theorem D.8. We use the following notation, inline with the above:

• X is the original Elo process, started from an arbitrary initial condition;
• U is the noisy Elo process, started from the same state as X—i.e., U 0 = X0;
• V is the noisy Elo process, started from equilibrium ˜π.

Recall that ∥f∥Lip ≤1. This with the triangle inequality allows us to control the steps individually:

Deduction of Theorem 2.5 from Theorems 2.7 and D.8

We start by recalling Theorem 2.5 for the reader’s convenience, numbered here as Theorem D.10.
Theorem D.10 (MCMC Estimator of Time-Averaged Ratings; Theorem 2.5). Denote the time-
averaged rating
At,T
k
:= 1

t
PT +t−1
s=T
Xs
k
for
k ∈[n]
and
t, T > 0.
Let C1, C2 < ∞. Then, there exists a constant C0 < ∞, depending only on C1 and C2, such that if

min{λq, η, 1/t} ≥n−C1
and
min{t, T} ≥C0t⋆
where
t⋆:= e2Mη−1λ−1

then

The same result holds for 1

n∥At,T −ρ∥1, the average distance in the ℓ1 (rather than ℓ2) sense.

Proof of Theorem 2.5/D.10. The two terms inside the probability come from the MCMC-convergence
error and the equilibrium-distribution bias. We use the abbreviations

At
k := 1

t
PT +t−1
s=T

k,
βk := |π(Πk) −ρk|
and

where Πk : Rn →R is the k-th projector. We separate the MCMC and bias parts:

∥At −ρ∥2
2 ≤2∥At −π(Π)∥2
2 + 2∥π(Π) −ρ∥2
2.

For the bias part, we simply note for now that

∥π(Π) −ρ∥2
2 = P

k |π(Πk) −ρk|2 = P

k =: n¯β2.

We now turn to the MCMC time-averages. Applying Theorem D.8 with f := Πk,

These bias and (average) variance terms are exactly what we handled in Theorem 2.7:

¯β2 ≤4e4Mη/(λqn)
and
¯σ2 ≤4e2Mη/(λqn).

The first part of Theorem 2.5 now follows from plugging these in above and some small manipulations.

To obtain the 1/(λqt) decay, we just need to check that t ≫t⋆:

Convergence Proofs: Parallel Matches

Our previous bounds on the bias and the variance included the spectral gap λq obtained from
sequential analysis—namely, we used P
e qe = 1. These expressions change in the parallel set-up.
This has a knock-on effect on the two terms in Theorem 2.5.

We now state an extended version of Theorem 3.3.
Theorem E.1. Denote the time-averaged rating

At,T

PT +t−1
s=T

= 1 −o(1),

where N := P

e∈E qe is the mean size of the matching; to emphasise, here, t and T count rounds.
Moreover, there exists a distribution ˜q = (˜qS)S∈M over matchings whose induced distribution
q = (qe)e∈E over pairs satisfies λq ≥1

We separate the proof of Theorem E.1 into two parts: the convergence and the existence of a
parallelisable q with λq ≥1

3λ⋆
disc. The “in particular” part follows exactly as for Theorem 2.5.

Proof of Theorem E.1: Convergence. Write ¯β2 := 1

n∥π(Π)−ρ∥2
2 and ¯σ2 := 1

n
P

k Varπ[Πk] for the
average ℓ2-bias and variance of the ratings, respectively, as we did in the deduction of Theorem 2.5.

The analysis of the bias is unchanged until we average over the choice {i, j} of players. Then, we
implicitly used P

e qe = 1 when averaging 2η2 over {i, j}. Letting N := P

e qe = ES∼˜q[|S|] denote
the expected size of the random matching ˜q corresponding to q, the same analysis gives

Ex

≤∥x −ρ∥2
2 + 2Nη2 −1

2e−4Mη P
i,j q{i,j}|(xi −ρi) −(xj −ρj)|2.

Inspecting the analysis of the variance to see where P

e qe = 1 is used, we get
P

k Var[X1/2
k
] ≤P

k Var[X0
k] + 3

2Nη2 −1

2e−2Mηλq
P
k Var[X0
k].

The proofs then proceed as before to give the bounds

¯β2 ≤4e4MηN/(λqn)
and
¯σ2 ≤3e2MηN/(λqn).

The argument for the deduction of Theorem 2.5 gives

P

n∥At,T −ρ∥2
2 ≤C0(¯β2 + ¯σ2/(ηλqt)

≥1 −n−C2;

now, (t, T) in At,T correspond to the number of rounds and q may have P

e qe > 1—and, so, λq
may be larger than 1/n, but not than N/n. Plugging in the new bounds for ¯β and ¯σ,

P


≥1 −n−C2.

Proof of Theorem E.1: λq ≳λ⋆
disc. Let q be an optimiser of λ⋆
disc: λq = λ⋆
disc. It can be formulated as
a semidefinite program [10], so its solution can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time.

Extending q from E to [n]2 by qi,j := q{i,j}1{{i, j} ∈E} defines a symmetric and substochatic
matrix with the same Dirichlet form. Adjusting the diagonal has no effect on the Dirichlet form, so
we may assume that it is, in fact, stochastic: its row sums are all exactly 1. The spectral gp of this q is
still λq, by the Dirichlet characterisation (Proposition B.1).

The Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem allows the decomposition of any n × n doubly stochastic matrix
into a convex combination of (at most) n2 permutation matrices in polynomial time:

q = Pn2

ℓ=1 αℓPσℓ

28


---Page Break---
where α ∈[0, 1]n2 with P
ℓαℓ= 1 and Pσ is the permutation matrix for σ ∈Symm(n):

(Pσ)i,j = 1{j = σ(i)}
for all
i, j ∈[n].

This can be chosen so that each permutation matrix has non-zero entries only over graph edges.

Given a permutation σi, we decompose it into disjoint cycles. These cycles actually correspond to
cycles in the graph; we can discard cycles with only one element. Let v1, v2, ..., vk be the vertices of
a particular cycle of length k. Then, we can decompose the cycle into three matchings:

• one containing all the edges in the cycle of type {vi, vi+1} with odd i ∈{1, ..., k −1};
• one containing all the edges in the cycle of type {vi, vi+1} with even i ∈{1, ..., k −1};
• one matching containing the single edge {vk, v1}.

This decomposition gives rise to a procedure to sample matchings in the graph.

1. Sample a permutation Σ according to the convex combination: P[Σ = σℓ] = αℓfor each ℓ.

2. For each cycle in Σ, independently sample one of the three induced matchings listed above,
each with probability 1/3.

The vertices in different cycles in a permutation are distinct. Hence, this procedure does indeed
product a matching. Moreover, the probability that a given edge {i, , j} ∈E belongs to the sampled
matching is precisely 1

3qi,j = 1

3q{i,j}. Hence, we have constructed a matching with associated
spectral gap at least 1

3λq. But, by assumption, λq = λ⋆
disc, completing the proof.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: the abstract and introduction make clear the contributions of our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss limitations of our work in the introduction and clearly state the
assumptions of our results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: complete proofs are included in the Appendix. An outline of the proof of our
main result is included in the main body of the text.

30


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: in the main body of the paper, we include enough details in order to repro-
duce our experimental results. The supplementary material includes our code so that our
experiments can be reproduced and verified.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: code is included in the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we have included our choice of parameters in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we include confidence intervals in the plots of our experiments. Statistical
significance tests are not really relevant for our experimental results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

32


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: the computer resources are not really relevant for interpreting our experiments.
We include the number of games simulated which is a better way to measure the complexity
of the algorithm analysed.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and our paper conform to it.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: we do not foresee any particular societal impact of our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

33

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer:[Yes]
Justification: our code uses an existing library to compute a von Neumann-Birkhoff de-
composition of a matrix. We have included the library and its licence in the supplementary
material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

34


---Page Break---
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: no new assets released. Code included for reproducibility has been commented
and include a README file.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
