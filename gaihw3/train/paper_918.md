Abstract

Model quantization is widely applied for compressing and accelerating deep neural
1

networks (DNNs). However, conventional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
2

focuses on training DNNs with uniform bit-width. The bit-width settings vary
3

across different hardware and transmission demands, which induces considerable
4

training and storage costs. Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training multiple
5

precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either store a larger
6

FP32 model to switch between different precision models for higher accuracy or
7

store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to using shared quanti-
8

zation parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Double Rounding quantization
9

method, which fully utilizes the quantized representation range to accomplish
10

nearly lossless bit-switching while reducing storage by using the highest integer
11

precision instead of full precision. Furthermore, we observe a competitive inter-
12

ference among different precisions during one-shot joint training, primarily due
13

to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales during backward propagation. To
14

tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) tech-
15

nique that dynamically adapts learning rates for various precisions to optimize the
16

training process. Additionally, we extend our Double Rounding to one-shot mixed
17

precision training and develop a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB)
18

strategy. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K classification demonstrate that
19

our methods have enough advantages to state-of-the-art one-shot joint QAT in both
20

multi-precision and mixed-precision. Our codes are available at here.

Introduction
22

Recently, with the popularity of mobile and edge devices, more and more researchers have attracted
23

attention to model compression due to the limitation of computing resources and storage. Model
24

quantization [1; 2] has gained significant prominence in the industry. Quantization maps floating-point
25

values to integer values, significantly reducing storage requirements and computational resources
26

without altering the network architecture.
27

Generally, for a given pre-trained model, the quantization bit-width configuration is predefined for a
28

specific application scenario. The quantized model then undergoes retraining, i.e., QAT, to mitigate
29

the accuracy decline. However, when the model is deployed across diverse scenarios with different
30

precisions, it often requires repetitive retraining processes for the same model. A lot of computing
31

resources and training costs are wasted. To address this challenge, involving the simultaneous
32

training of multi-precision [3; 4] or one-shot mixed-precision [3; 5] have been proposed. Among
33

these approaches, some involve sharing weight parameters between low-precision and high-precision
34

models, enabling dynamic bit-width switching during inference.
35

However, bit-switching from high precision (or bit-width) to low precision may introduce significant
36

accuracy degradation due to the Rounding operation in the quantization process. Additionally, there is
37

severe competition in the convergence process between higher and lower precisions in multi-precision

scheme. In mixed-precision scheme, previous methods often incur vast searching and retraining costs
39

due to decoupling the training and search stages. Due to the above challenges, bit-switching remains
40

a very challenging problem. Our motivation is designing a bit-switching quantization method that
41

doesn’t require storing a full-precision model and achieves nearly lossless switching from high-bits to
42

low-bits. Specifically, for different precisions, we propose unified representation, normalized learning
43

steps, and tuned probability distribution so that an efficient and stable learning process is achieved
44

across multiple and mixed precisions, as depicted in Figure 1.
45

To solve the bit-switching problem, prior methods either store the floating-point parameters [6; 7; 4; 8]
46

to avoid accuracy degradation or abandon some integer values by replacing rounding with floor[3; 9]
47

but leading to accuracy decline or training collapse at lower bit-widths. We propose Double Rounding,
48

which applies the rounding operation twice instead of once, as shown in Figure1 (a). This approach
49

ensures nearly lossless bit-switching and allows storing the highest bit-width model instead of the
50

full-precision model. Specifically, the lower precision weight is included in the higher precision
51

weight, reducing storage constraints.
52

Moreover, we empirically find severe competition between higher and lower precisions, particularly
53

in 2-bit precision, as also noted in [10; 4]. There are two reasons for this phenomenon: The optimal
54

quantization interval itself is different for higher and lower precisions. Furthermore, shared weights
55

are used for different precisions during joint training, but the quantization interval gradients for
56

different precisions exhibit distinct magnitudes during training. Therefore, we introduce an Adaptive
57

Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) method, designed to dynamically adjust the learning rates across
58

different precisions, which ensures consistent update steps of quantization scales corresponding to
59

different precisions, as shown in the Figure 1 (b).
60

Finally, we develop an efficient one-shot mixed-precision quantization approach based on Double
61

Rounding. Prior mixed-precision approaches first train a SuperNet with predefined bit-width lists,
62

then search for optimal candidate SubNets under restrictive conditions, and finally retrain or fine-tune
63

them, which incurs significant time and training costs. However, we use the Hessian Matrix Trace [11]
64

as a sensitivity metric for different layers to optimize the SuperNet and propose a Hessian-Aware
65

Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy, inspired by the Roulette algorithm [12]. This strategy
66

enables tuned probability distribution of switching bit-width across layers, assigning higher bits to
67

more sensitive layers and lower bits to less sensitive ones, as shown in Figure 1 (c). And, we add the
68

sensitivity to the search stage as a constraint factor. So, our approach can omit the last stage.

In conclusion, our main contributions can be described as:
70

• Double Rounding quantization method for multi-precision is proposed, which stores a single
71

integer weight to enable adaptive precision switching with nearly lossless accuracy.
72

• Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling (ALRS) method for the multi-precision scheme is intro-
73

duced, which effectively narrows the training convergence gap between high-precision
74

and low-precision, enhancing the accuracy of low-precision models without compromising
75

high-precision model accuracy.
76

• Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy for one-shot mixed-precision
77

SuperNet is applied, where the access probability of bit-width for each layer is determined
78

based on the layer’s sensitivity.
79

• Experimental results on the ImageNet1K dataset demonstrate that our proposed methods are
80

comparable to state-of-the-art methods across different mainstream CNN architectures.

Multi-Precision. Multi-Precision entails a single shared model with multiple precisions by one-shot
83

joint Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). This approach can dynamically adapt uniform bit-switching
84

for the entire model according to computing resources and storage constraints. AdaBits [13] is the
85

first work to consider adaptive bit-switching but encounters convergence issues with 2-bit quantization
86

on ResNet50 [14]. Bit-Mixer [9] addresses this problem by using the LSQ [2] quantization method
87

but discards the lowest state quantized value, resulting in an accuracy decline. Multi-Precision
88

joint QAT can also be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem. Any-precision [6] and
89

MultiQuant [4] combine knowledge distillation techniques to improve model accuracy. Among these
90

methods, MultiQuant’s proposed "Online Adaptive Label" training strategy is essentially a form of
91

self-distillation [15]. Similar to our method, AdaBits and Bit-Mixer can save an 8-bit model, while
92

other methods rely on 32-bit models for bit switching. Our Double Rounding method can store the
93

highest bit-width model (e.g., 8-bit) and achieve almost lossless bit-switching, ensuring a stable
94

optimization process. Importantly, this leads to a reduction in training time by approximately 10% [7]
95

compared to separate quantization training.
96

One-shot Mixed-Precision. Previous works mainly utilize costly approaches, such as reinforcement
97

learning [16; 17] and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [18; 19; 20], or rely on partial prior knowl-
98

edge [21; 22] for bit-width allocation, which may not achieve global optimality. In contrast, our
99

proposed one-shot mixed-precision method employs Hessian-Aware optimization to refine a SuperNet
100

via gradient updates, and then obtain the optimal conditional SubNets with less search cost without
101

retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, Bit-Mixer [9] and MultiQuant [4] implement layer-adaptive
102

mixed-precision models, but Bit-Mixer uses a naive search method to attain a sub-optimal solution,
103

while MultiQuant requires 300 epochs of fine-tuning to achieve ideal performance. Unlike NAS
104

approaches [20], which focus on altering network architecture (e.g., depth, kernel size, or channels),
105

our method optimizes a once-for-all SuperNet using only quantization techniques without altering
106

the model architecture.

Double Rounding
109

Conventional separate precision quantization using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) [23] attain
110

a fixed bit-width quantized model under a pre-trained FP32 model. A pseudo-quantization node is
111

inserted into each layer of the model during training. This pseudo-quantization node comprises two
112

operations: the quantization operation quant(x), which maps floating-point (FP32) values to lower-
113

bit integer values, and the dequantization operation dequant(x), which restores the quantized integer
114

value to its original floating-point representation. It can simulate the quantization error incurred
115

when compressing float values into integer values. As quantization involves a non-differentiable
116

Rounding operation, Straight-Through Estimator (STE) [24] is commonly used to handle the non-
117

differentiability.
118

However, for multi-precision quantization, bit-switching can result in significant accuracy loss,
119

especially when transitioning from higher bit-widths to lower ones, e.g., from 8-bit to 2-bit. To

Figure 2: Comparison of four quantization schemes:(from left to right) used in LSQ [2], AdaBits [3],
Bit-Mixer [9] and Ours Double Rounding. In all cases y = dequant(quant(x)).

mitigate this loss, prior works have mainly employed two strategies: one involves bit-switching from
121

a floating-point model (32-bit) to a lower-bit model each time using multiple learnable quantization
122

parameters, and the other substitutes the Rounding operation with the Floor operation, but this
123

results in accuracy decline (especially in 2-bit). In contrast, we propose a nearly lossless bit-
124

switching quantization method called Double Rounding. This method overcomes these limitations by
125

employing a Rounding operation twice. It allows the model to be saved in the highest-bit (e.g., 8-bit)
126

representation instead of full-precision, facilitating seamless switching to other bit-width models. A
127

detailed comparison of Double Rounding with other quantization methods is shown in Figure 2.
128

Unlike AdaBits, which relies on the Dorefa [1] quantization method where the quantization scale is
129

determined based on the given bit-width, the quantization scale of our Double Rounding is learned
130

online and is not fixed. It only requires a pair of shared quantization parameters, i.e., scale and
131

zero-point. Quantization scales of different precisions adhere to a strict "Power of Two" relationship.
132

Suppose the highest-bit and the target low-bit are denoted as h-bit and l-bit respectively, and the
133

difference between them is ∆= h −l. The specific formulation of Double Rounding is as follows:
134

f
Wh = clip(
W −zh

sh


, −2h−1, 2h−1 −1)
(1)

f
Wl = clip(

$
f
Wh

2∆

'

, −2l−1, 2l−1 −1)
(2)

c
Wl = f
Wl × sh × 2∆+ zh
(3)

where the symbol ⌊.⌉denotes the Rounding function, and clip(x, low, upper) means x is limited
135

to the range between low and upper. Here, W represents the FP32 model’s weights, sh ∈R
136

and zh ∈Z denote the highest-bit (e.g., 8-bit) quantization scale and zero-point respectively. f
Wh
137

represent the quantized weights of the highest-bit, while f
Wl and c
Wl represent the quantized weights
138

and dequantized weights of the low-bit respectively.
139

Hardware shift operations can efficiently execute the division and multiplication by 2∆. Note that in
140

our Double Rounding, the model can also be saved at full precision by using unshared quantization
141

parameters to run bit-switching and attain higher accuracy. Because we use symmetric quantization
142

scheme, the zh is 0. Please refer to Section A.4 for the gradient formulation of Double Rounding.
143

Unlike fixed weights, activations change online during inference. So, the corresponding scale and
144

zero-point values for different precisions can be learned individually to increase overall accuracy.
145

Suppose X denotes the full precision activation, and f
Xb and c
Xb are the quantized activation and
146

dequantized activation respectively. The quantization process can be formulated as follows:
147

f
Xb = clip(
X −zb

sb


, 0, 2b −1)
(4)

c
Xb = f
Xb × sb + zb
(5)

where sb ∈R and zb ∈Z represent the quantization scale and zero-point of different bit-widths
148

activation respectively. Note that zb is 0 for the ReLU activation function.

3.2
Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling for Multi-Precision
150

Although our proposed Double Rounding method represents a significant improvement over most
151

previous multi-precision works, the one-shot joint optimization of multiple precisions remains
152

constrained by severe competition between the highest and lowest precisions [10; 4]. Different
153

precisions simultaneously impact each other during joint training, resulting in substantial differences
154

4


---Page Break---
in convergence rates between them, as shown in Figure 3 (c). We experimentally find that this
155

competitive relationship stems from the inconsistent magnitudes of the quantization scale’s gradients
156

between high-bit and low-bit quantization during joint training, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b). For
157

other models statistical results please refer to Section A.6 in the appendix.

Motivated by these observations, we introduce a technique termed Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling
159

(ALRS), which dynamically adjusts learning rates for different precisions to optimize the training
160

process. This technique is inspired by the Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) [25] optimizer.
161

Specifically, suppose the current batch iteration’s learning rate is λ, we set learning rates λb of
162

different precisions as follows:

where the L is the number of layers, clip_grad(.) represents gradient clipping that prevents gradient
164

explosion, max_abs(.) denotes the maximum absolute value of all elements. The ∇si
b denotes the
165

quantization scale’s gradients of layer i and ηb denotes scaling hyperparameter of different precisions,
166

e.g., 8-bit is 1, 6-bit is 0.1, and 4-bit is 0.01. Note that the ALRS strategy is only used for updating
167

quantization scales. It can adaptively update the learning rates of different precisions and ensure
168

that model can optimize quantization parameters at the same pace, ultimately achieving a minimal
169

convergence gap in higher bits and 2-bit, as shown in Figure 3 (d).
170

In multi-precision scheme, different precisions share the same model weights during joint training.
171

For conventional multi-precision, the shared weight computes n forward processes at each training
172

iteration, where n is the number of candidate bit-widths. The losses attained from different precisions
173

are then accumulated, and the gradients are computed. Finally, the shared parameters are updated.
174

For detailed implementation please refer to Algorithm A.1 in the appendix. However, we find that
175

if different precision losses separately compute gradients and directly update shared parameters at
176

each forward process, it attains better accuracy when combined with our ALRS training strategy.
177

Additionally, we use dual optimizers to update the weight parameters and quantization parameters
178

simultaneously. We also set the weight-decay of the quantization scales to 0 to achieve stable
179

convergence. For detailed implementation please refer to Algorithm A.2 in the appendix.

One-Shot Mixed-Precision SuperNet
181

Unlike multi-precision, where all layers uniformly utilize the same bit-width, mixed-precision
182

SuperNet provides finer-grained adaptive by configuring the bit-width at different layers. Previous
183

methods typically decouple the training and search stages, which need a third stage for retraining
184

or fine-tuning the searched SubNets. These approaches generally incur substantial search costs in
185

selecting the optimal SubNets, often employing methods such as greedy algorithms [26; 9] or genetic
186

algorithms [27; 4]. Considering the fact that the sensitivity [28], i.e., importance, of each layer
187

is different, we propose a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy for one-shot
188

mixed-precision training.
189

Specifically, the Hessian Matrix Trace (HMT) is utilized to measure the sensitivity of each layer. We
190

first need to compute the pre-trained model’s HMT by around 1000 training images [11], as shown in
191

Higher bits are priority selected for sensitive layers, while all candidate bits are equally selected for
193

unsensitive layers. Our proposed Roulette algorithm is used for bit-switching processes of different
194

layers during training, as shown in the Algorithm 1. If a layer’s HMT exceeds the average HMT of
195

all layers, it is recognized as sensitive, and the probability distribution of Figure 4 (b) is used for bit
196

selection. Conversely, if the HMT is below the average, the probability distribution of Figure 4 (a) is
197

used for selection. Finally, the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) [29] algorithm is employed to find
198

the optimal SubNets. Considering each layer’s sensitivity during training and adding this sensitivity
199

to the ILP’s constraint factors (e.g., model’s FLOPs, latency, and parameters), which depend on
200

the actual deployment requirements. We can efficiently attain a set of optimal SubNets during the
201

search stage without retraining, thereby significant reduce the overall costs. All the searched SubNets
202

collectively constitute the Pareto Frontier optimal solution, as shown in Figure 4 (d). For detailed
203

mixed-precision training and searching process (i.e., ILP) please refer to the Algorithm A.3 and the
204

Algorithm 2 respectively.

Experimental Results
206

Setup. In this paper, we mainly focus on ImageNet-1K [30] classification task using both classical
207

networks (ResNet18/50 [14]) and lightweight networks (MobileNetV2 [31]), which same as previous
208

works. Experiments cover joint quantization training for multi-precision and mixed precision. We
209

explore two candidate bit configurations, i.e., {8,6,4,2}-bit and {4,3,2}-bit, each number represents
210

the quantization level of the weight and activation layers. Like previous methods, we exclude batch
211

6


---Page Break---
normalization layers from quantization, and the first and last layers are kept at full precision. We
212

initialize the multi-precision models with a pre-trained FP32 model, and initialize the mixed-precision
213

models with a pre-trained multi-precision model. All models use the Adam optimizer [32] with a batch
214

size of 256 for 90 epochs and use a cosine scheduler without warm-up phase. The initial learning
215

rate is 5e-4 and weight decay is 5e-5. Data augmentation uses the standard set of transformations
216

including random cropping, resizing to 224×224 pixels, and random flipping. Images are resized to
217

256×256 pixels and then center-cropped to 224×224 resolution during evaluation.

Results. For {8,6,4,2}-bit configuration, the Top-1 validation accuracy is shown in Table 1. The
220

network weights and the corresponding activations are quantized into w-bit and a-bit respectively.
221

Our double-rounding combined with ALRS training strategy surpasses the previous state-of-the-art
222

(SOTA) methods. For example, in ResNet18, it exceeds Any-Precision [6] by 2.7%(or 2.83%) under
223

w8a8 setting without(or with) using KD technique [15], and outperforms MultiQuant [4] by 0.63%(or
224

0.73%) under w4a4 setting without(or with) using KD technique respectively. Additionally, when
225

the candidate bit-list includes 2-bit, the previous methods can’t converge on MobileNetV2 during
226

training. So, they use {8,6,4}-bit precision for MobileNetV2 experiments. For consistency, we
227

also test {8,6,4}-bit results, as shown in the "Ours {8,6,4}-bit" rows of Table 1. Our method achieves
228

0.25%/0.11%/0.56% higher accuracy than AdaBits [3] under the w8a8/w6a6/w4a4 settings.
229

Notably, our method exhibits the ability to converge but shows a big decline in accuracy on Mo-
230

bileNetV2. On the one hand, the compact model exhibits significant differences in the quantization
231

scale gradients of different channels due to involving DeepWise Convolution [33]. On the other hand,
232

when the bit-list includes 2-bit, it intensifies competition between different precisions during training.
233

To improve the accuracy of compact models, we suggest considering the per-layer or per-channel
234

learning rate scaling techniques in future work.

For {4,3,2}-bit configuration, Table 2 demonstrate that our double-rounding consistently surpasses
236

previous SOTA methods. For instance, in ResNet18, it exceeds Bit-Mixer [9] by 0.63%/0.7%/1.2%(or
237

0.37%/0.64%/1.02%) under w4a4/w3a3/w2a2 settings without(or with) using KD technique, and
238

outperforms ABN[10] by 0.87%/0.74%/1.12% under w4a4/w3a3/w2a2 settings with using KD
239

technique respectively. In ResNet50, Our method outperforms Bit-Mixer [9] by 0.86%/0.63%/0.1%
240

under w4a4/w3a3/w2a2 settings.
241

Notably, the overall results of Table 2 are worse than the {8,6,4,2}-bit configuration for joint training.
242

We analyze that this discrepancy arises from information loss in the shared lower precision model
243

---Page Break---
(i.e., 4-bit) used for bit-switching. In other words, compared with 4-bit, it is easier to directly optimize
244

8-bit quantization parameters to converge to the optimal value. So, we recommend including 8-bit for
245

multi-precision training. Furthermore, independently learning the quantization scales for different
246

precisions, including weights and activations, significantly improves accuracy compared to using
247

shared scales. However, it requires saving the model in 32-bit format, as shown in "Ours*" of Table 2.

Results. We follow previous works to conduct mixed-precision experiments based on the {4,3,2}-bit
250

configuration. Our proposed one-shot mixed-precision joint quantization method with the HASB tech-
251

nique comparable to the previous SOTA methods, as presented in Table 3. For example, in ResNet18,
252

our method exceeds Bit-Mixer [9] by 0.83%/0.72%/0.77%/7.07% under w4a4/w3a3/w2a2/3MP
253

settings and outperforms EQ-Net[5] by 0.2% under 3MP setting. The results demonstrate the effec-
254

tiveness of one-shot mixed-precision joint training to consider sensitivity with Hessian Matrix Trace
255

when randomly allocating bit-widths for different layers. Additionally, Table 3 reveals that our results
256

do not achieve optimal performance across all settings. We hypothesize that extending the number of
257

training epochs or combining ILP with other efficient search methods, such as genetic algorithms,
258

may be necessary to achieve optimal results in mixed-precision optimization.

Ablation Studies

ALRS vs. Conventional in Multi-Precision. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed ALRS train-
261

ing strategy, we conduct an ablation experiment without KD, as shown in Table 4, and observe overall
262

accuracy improvements, particularly for the 2bit. Like previous works, where MobileNetV2 can’t
263

achieve stable convergence with {4,3,2}-bit, we also opt for {8,6,4}-bit to keep consistent. However,
264

our method can achieve stable convergence with {8,6,4,2}-bit quantization. This demonstrates the
265

superiority of our proposed Double-Rounding and ALRS methods.
266

Multi-Precision vs. Separate-Precision in Time Cost. We statistic the results regarding the time cost
267

for multi-precision compared to separate-precision quantization, as shown in Table 5. Multi-precision
268

training costs stay approximate constant as the number of candidate bit-widths.

Pareto Frontier of Different Mixed-Precision Configurations. To verify the effectiveness of our
270

HASB strategy, we conduct ablation experiments on different bit-lists. Figure 5 shows the search
271

results of Mixed-precision SuperNet under {8,6,4,2}-bit, {4,3,2}-bit and {8,4}-bit configurations
272

respectively. Where each point represents a SubNet. These results are obtained directly from ILP

Conclusion
276

This paper first introduces Double Rounding quantization method used to address the challenges
277

of multi-precision and mixed-precision joint training. It can store single integer-weight parameters
278

and attain nearly lossless bit-switching. Secondly, we propose an Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling
279

(ALRS) method for multi-precision joint training that narrows the training convergence gap between
280

high-precision and low-precision, enhancing model accuracy of multi-precision. Finally, our proposed
281

Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy for one-shot mixed-precision SuperNet
282

and efficient searching method combined with Integer Linear Programming, achieving approximate
283

Pareto Frontier optimal solution. Our proposed methods aim to achieve a flexible and effective model
284

compression technique for adapting different storage and computation requirements.

Different Quantization Types
391

In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the different quantization types during
392

Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), as is shown in Figure 6.

(a) Separate-Precision:  Each bit-width 
requires training a new network with 
separate weights by repeating multi-retrain.

(b) Multi-Precision: A shared network can be 
quantized to any bit-width at runtime without 
re-training or finetuning. All layers inside the 
network uniformly share the same bit-width.

(c) Mixed-Precision: A SuperNet whose 
individual layers can be quantized to any 
bit-width at runtime, and its searched 
subnets without re-training or fine-tuning.

The Gradient Formulation of Double Rounding
399

A general formulation for uniform quantization process is as follows:
400

f
W = clip(
W

s


+ z, −2b−1, 2b−1 −1)
(8)

c
W = (f
W −z) × s
(9)

1


---Page Break---
where the symbol ⌊.⌉denotes the Rounding function, clip(x, low, upper) expresses x below low
401

are set to low and above upper are set to upper. b denotes the quantization level (or bit-width),
402

s ∈R and z ∈Z represents the quantization scale (or interval) and zero-point associated with each b,
403

respectively. W represents the FP32 model’s weights, f
W signifies the quantized integer weights, and
404

c
W represents the dequantized floating-point weights.
405

The quantization scale of our Double Rounding is learned online and not fixed. And it only needs a
406

pair of shared quantization parameters, i.e., scale and zero-point. Suppose the highest-bit and the
407

low-bit are denoted as h-bit and l-bit respectively, and the difference between them is ∆= h −l.
408

The specific formulation is as follows:
409

f
Wh = clip(
W −zh

sh


, −2h−1, 2h−1 −1)
(10)

f
Wl = clip(

$ f
Wh

2∆

'

, −2l−1, 2l−1 −1)
(11)

c
Wl = f
Wl × sh × 2∆+ zh
(12)

where sh ∈R and zh ∈Z denote the highest-bit quantization scale and zero-point respectively. f
Wh
410

and f
Wl represent the quantized weights of the highest-bit and low-bit respectively. Hardware shift
411

operations can efficiently execute the division and multiplication by 2∆. And the zh is 0 for the
412

weight quantization in this paper. The gradient formulation of Double Rounding for one-shot joint
413

training is represented as follows:
414

∂bY
∂sh
≃

(j
Y −zh

sh

m
−Y −zh

sh
if n < Y −zh

sh
< p,

n
or
p
otherwise.
(13)

∂bY
∂zh
≃

(
0
if n < Y −zh

sh
< p,
1
otherwise.
(14)

where n and p denote the lower and upper bounds of the integer range [Nmin, Nmax] for quantizing
415

the weights or activations respectively. Y represents the FP32 weights or activations, and bY represents
416

the dequantized weights or activations. Unlike weights, activation quantization scale and zero-point
417

of different precisions are learned independently. However, the gradient formulation is the same.
418

A.5
Algorithms
419

This section provides the algorithm implementations of multi-precision, one-shot mixed-precision
420

joint training, and the search stage of SubNets.
421

A.5.1
Multi-Precision Joint Training
422

The multi-precision model with different quantization precisions shares the same model weight(e.g.,
423

the highest-bit) during joint training. In conventional multi-precision, the shared weight (e.g., multi-
424

precision model) computes n forward processes at each training iteration, where n is the number of
425

candidate bit-widths. Then, all attained losses of different precisions perform an accumulation, and
426

update the parameters accordingly. For specific implementation details please refer to Algorithm A.1.
427

However, we find that if separate precision loss and parameter updates are performed directly after
428

calculating a precision at each forward process, it will lead to difficulty convergence during training
429

or suboptimal accuracy. In other words, the varying gradient magnitudes of quantization scales of
430

different precisions make it hard to attain stable convergence during joint training. To address this
431

issue, we introduce an adaptive approach (e.g., Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling, ALRS) to alter the
432

learning rate for different precisions during training, aiming to achieve a consistent update pace.
433

This method allows us to directly update the shared parameters after calculating the loss after every
434

forward. We update both the weight parameters and quantization parameters simultaneously using
435

dual optimizers. We also set the weight-decay of the quantization scales to 0 to achieve more stable
436

convergence. For specific implementation details, please refer to Algorithm A.2.

One-shot Joint Training for Mixed Precision SuperNet
438

Unlike multi-precision joint quantization, the bit-switching of mixed-precision training is more
439

complicated. In multi-precision training, the bit-widths calculated in each iteration are fixed, e.g.,
440

{8,6,4,2}-bit. In mixed-precision training, the bit-widths of different layers are not fixed in each
441

iteration, e.g., {8,random-bit,2}-bit, where "random-bit" is any bits of e.g., {7,6,5,4,3,2}-bit, similar
442

to the sandwich strategy of [39]. Therefore, mixed precision training often requires more training
443

epochs to reach convergence compared to multi-precision training. Bit-mixer [9] conducts the same
444

probability of selecting bit-width for different layers. However, we take the sensitivity of each layer
445

into consideration which uses sensitivity (e.g. Hessian Matrix Trace [11]) as a metric to identify the
446

selection probability of different layers. For more sensitive layers, preference is given to higher-bit
447

widths, and vice versa. We refer to this training strategy as a Hessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching
448

(HASB) strategy for optimizing one-shot mixed-precision SuperNet. Specific implementation details
449

can be found in Algorithm A.3. In additionally, unlike multi-precision joint training, the BN layers
450

are replaced by TBN (Transitional Batch-Norm) [9], which compensates for the distribution shift
451

between adjacent layers that are quantized to different bit-widths. To achieve the best convergence
452

effect, we propose that the threshold of bit-switching (i.e., σ) also increases as the epoch increases.

A.5.3
Efficient one-shot searching for Mixed Precision SuperNet
454

After training the mixed-precision SuperNet, the next step is to select the appropriate optimal SubNets
455

based on conditions, such as model parameters, latency, and FLOPs, for actual deployment and
456

inference. To achieve optimal allocations for candidate bit-width under given conditions, we employ
457

the Iterative Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach. Since each ILP run can only provide
458

one solution, we obtain multiple solutions by altering the values of different average bit widths.
459

Specifically, given a trained SuperNet (e.g., RestNet18), it takes less than two minutes to solve
460

candidate SubNets. It can be implemented through the Python PULP package. Finally, these searched
461

SubNets only need inference to attain final accuracy, which needs a few hours. This forms a Pareto
462

optimal frontier. From this frontier, we can select the appropriate subnet for deployment. Specific
463

implementation details of the searching process by ILP can be found in Algorithm 2.

A.6
The Gradient Statistics of Learnable Scale of Quantization
465

In this section, we analyze the changes in gradients of the learnable scale for different models during
466

the training process. Figure 7 and Figure 8 display the gradient statistical results for ResNet20 on
467

CIFAR-10. Similarly, Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the gradient statistical results for ResNet18 on
468

ImageNet-1K, and Figure 11 and Figure 12 present the gradient statistical results for ResNet50 on
469

ImageNet-1K. These figures reveal a similarity in the range of gradient changes between higher-bit
470

quantization and 2-bit quantization. Notably, they illustrate that the value range of 2-bit quantization
471

is noticeably an order of magnitude higher than the value ranges of higher-bit quantization.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
473

1. Claims
474

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
475

paper’s contributions and scope?
476

Answer: [Yes]
477

Justification: [TODO] Please refer to the Abstract Section and Section 1, where related
478

material for the question can be found.
479

Guidelines:
480

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
481

made in the paper.
482

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
483

contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
484

NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
485

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
486

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
487

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
488

are not attained by the paper.
489

2. Limitations
490

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
491

Answer: [TODO][Yes]
492

Justification: [TODO] Although our proposed methods have achieved comparable results in
493

multi-precision and mixed-precision, this paper has several limitations and improvements.
494

(1) Due to time and computing resource constraints, our methods are only tested on common
495

CNNs-based networks and aren’t tested on ViTs-based networks. (2) For multi-precision,
496

compact networks, e.g., MobileNet, still have a big drop in 2bit. We will try to use per-layer
497

or per-channel adaptive learning rate adjustment in the future. (3) For mixed precision,
498

relying only on one-shot ILP-based SubNets search may yield a suboptimal solution. We
499

further need to combine it with other efficient search methods, e.g., genetic algorithms, to
500

achieve global optimal.
501

Guidelines:
502

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
503

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
504

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
505

• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
506

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
507

model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
508

should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
509

implications would be.
510

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
511

only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
512

depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
513

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
514

For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
515

is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
516

used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
517

technical jargon.
518

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
519

and how they scale with dataset size.
520

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
521

address problems of privacy and fairness.
522

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
523

reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
524

limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
525

1


---Page Break---
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
526

tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
527

will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
528

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
529

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
530

a complete (and correct) proof?
531

Answer: [Yes]
532

Justification: [TODO] We display index numbers wherever formulas and theoretical support
533

are needed. For example, please refer to Section 3.
534

Guidelines:
535

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
536

• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
537

referenced.
538

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
539

• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
540

they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
541

proof sketch to provide intuition.
542

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
543

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
544

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
545

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
546

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
547

perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
548

of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
549

Answer: [Yes] To ensure that our experimental results can be reproduced: (1) we describe

the experimental training settings and algorithm pseudocode in detail in Section 4 and
551

Section A.5, and (2) we also provide the code related to all experiments in this paper,
552

allowing the community to improve and conduct further research.
553

Justification: [TODO]
554

Guidelines:
555

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
556

• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
557

well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
558

whether the code and data are provided or not.
559

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
560

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
561

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
562

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
563

might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
564

be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
565

dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
566

one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
567

instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
568

of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
569

appropriate to the research performed.
570

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
571

sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
572

nature of the contribution. For example
573

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
574

to reproduce that algorithm.
575

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
576

the architecture clearly and fully.
577

2


---Page Break---
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
578

either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
579

the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
580

the dataset).
581

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
582

authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
583

In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
584

some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
585

to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
586

5. Open access to data and code
587

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
588

tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
589

material?
590

Answer: [Yes]
591

Justification: [TODO] Our code are available at here and the data is open source dataset.
592

Guidelines:
593

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
594

• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
595

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
596

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
597

possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
598

including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
599

benchmark).
600

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
601

reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
602

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
603

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
604

to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
605

• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
606

proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
607

should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
608

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
609

versions (if applicable).
610

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
611

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
612

6. Experimental Setting/Details
613

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
614

parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
615

results?
616

Answer: [Yes]
617

Justification: [TODO] Our codes are available here and include all related training and test
618

details.
619

Guidelines:
620

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
621

• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
622

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
623

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
624

material.
625

7. Experiment Statistical Significance
626

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
627

information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
628

Answer: [Yes]
629

3


---Page Break---
Justification: [TODO] Please refer to the Section A.6 in the appendix.
630

Guidelines:
631

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
632

• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
633

dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
634

the main claims of the paper.
635

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
636

example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
637

run with given experimental conditions).
638

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
639

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
640

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
641

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
642

of the mean.
643

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
644

preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
645

of Normality of errors is not verified.
646

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
647

figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
648

error rates).
649

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
650

they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
651

8. Experiments Compute Resources
652

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
653

puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
654

the experiments?
655

Answer: [Yes]
656

Justification: [TODO] Please refer to the Table 5.
657

Guidelines:
658

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
659

• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
660

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
661

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
662

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
663

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
664

than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
665

didn’t make it into the paper).
666

9. Code Of Ethics
667

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
668

NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
669

Answer: [Yes]
670

Justification: [TODO] We have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and conform to it.
671

Guidelines:
672

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
673

• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
674

deviation from the Code of Ethics.
675

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
676

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
677

10. Broader Impacts
678

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
679

societal impacts of the work performed?
680

4


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
681

Justification: [TODO] Due to space limitations, this social impact aspect is not discussed
682

in the main paper. This paper doesn’t involve negative societal impacts including potential
683

malicious or unintended uses. Our proposed methods aim to achieve an efficient and
684

effective model compression technique to flexible adaptive different storage and computation
685

requirements, which are beneficial to social advancement.
686

Guidelines:
687

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
688

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
689

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
690

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
691

(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
692

(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
693

groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
694

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
695

to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
696

any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
697

to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
698

generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
699

that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
700

models that generate Deepfakes faster.
701

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
702

being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
703

technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
704

from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
705

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
706

strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
707

mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
708

feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
709

11. Safeguards
710

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
711

release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
712

image generators, or scraped datasets)?
713

Answer: [NA]
714

Justification: [TODO] This paper doesn’t have any high risk for misuse.
715

Guidelines:
716

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
717

• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
718

necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
719

that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
720

safety filters.
721

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
722

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
723

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
724

not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
725

faith effort.
726

12. Licenses for existing assets
727

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
728

the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
729

properly respected?
730

Answer: [Yes]
731

Justification: [TODO] We conform to the CC-BY 4.0 license.
732

Guidelines:
733

5


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
734

• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
735

• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
736

URL.
737

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
738

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
739

service of that source should be provided.
740

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
741

package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
742

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
743

license of a dataset.
744

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
745

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
746

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
747

the asset’s creators.
748

13. New Assets
749

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
750

provided alongside the assets?
751

Answer: [NA]
752

Justification: [TODO] This paper does not release new assets
753

Guidelines:
754

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
755

• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
756

submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
757

limitations, etc.
758

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
759

asset is used.
760

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
761

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
762

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
763

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
764

include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
765

well as details about compensation (if any)?
766

Answer: [NA]
767

Justification: [TODO] This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
768

subjects.
769

Guidelines:
770

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
771

human subjects.
772

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
773

tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
774

included in the main paper.
775

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
776

or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
777

collector.
778

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
779

Subjects
780

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
781

such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
782

approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
783

institution) were obtained?
784

Answer: [NA]
785

6


---Page Break---
Justification: [TODO] This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
786

subjects.
787

Guidelines:
788

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
789

human subjects.
790

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
791

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
792

should clearly state this in the paper.
793

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
794

and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
795

guidelines for their institution.
796

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
797

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
