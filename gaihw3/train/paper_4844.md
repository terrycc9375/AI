Abstract

The theory of boosting provides a computational framework for aggregating approx-
imate weak learning algorithms, which perform marginally better than a random
predictor, into an accurate strong learner. In the realizable case, the success of
the boosting approach is underscored by a remarkable fact that the resultant sam-
ple complexity matches that of a computationally demanding alternative, namely
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). This in particular implies that the realiz-
able boosting methodology has the potential to offer computational relief without
compromising on sample efficiency.
Despite recent progress, in agnostic boosting, where assumptions on the conditional
distribution of labels given feature descriptions are absent, ERM outstrips the
agnostic boosting methodology in being quadratically more sample efficient than all
known agnostic boosting algorithms. In this paper, we make progress on closing this
gap, and give a substantially more sample efficient agnostic boosting algorithm than
those known, without compromising on the computational (or oracle) complexity.
A key feature of our algorithm is that it leverages the ability to reuse samples across
multiple rounds of boosting, while guaranteeing a generalization error strictly better
than those obtained by blackbox applications of uniform convergence arguments.
We also apply our approach to other previously studied learning problems, including
boosting for reinforcement learning, and demonstrate improved results.

Introduction

A striking observation in statistical learning is that given a small number of samples it is possible to
learn the best classifier from an almost exponentially large class of predictors. In fact, it is possible to
do using a conceptually straightforward procedure – Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) – that finds
a classifier that is maximally consistent with the collected samples. Substantiating this observation,
the fundamental theorem of statistical learning (e.g., [SSBD14]) states that with high probability ERM
can guarantee ε−excess population error with respect to the best classifier from a finite, but large
hypothesis class H given merely magnostic ≈(log |H|)/ε2 identically distributed and independent
(IID) samples of pairs of features and labels from the population distribution. Under an additional
assumption – that of realizability – guaranteeing that there exists a perfect classifier in the hypothesis
class achieving zero error, a yet quadratically smaller number mrealizable ≈(log |H|)/ε of samples
suffice. In the absence of such assumption, the learning problem is said to take place in the agnostic
setting, i.e., under of a lack of belief in the ability of any hypothesis to perfectly fit the observed data.

This ability to generalize to the population distribution and successfully (PAC) learn from an almost
exponentially large, and hence expressive, hypothesis class given limited number of examples suggests
that the primary bottleneck for efficient learning is computational. Indeed, even with modest sample
requirements, finding a maximally consistent hypothesis within an almost exponentially large class
via, say, enumeration or global search, is generally computationally intractable.

Table 1: A comparison between sample and oracle complexities (i.e., number of weak learning
calls) of the present results and previous works, in each case to achieve ε-excess population error.
Here we suppress polylogarithmic factors. We make progress on closing the sample complexity gap
between ERM, which is computationally inefficient, and boosting-based approaches. The γ-weak
leaner outputs a hypothesis from the base class B, which is usually substantially smaller than H
against which the final agnostic learning guarantee holds. In practice, boosting is used with learners
with small values of log |B|. See Definition 1 for details. See the paragraph following Theorem 1
in [KK09] and Section 3.3 in [BCHM20] for derivation of these bounds. See also Theorem 2.14 in
[AGHM21] for a bound on the expressivity of the boosted class to derive ERM’s sample complexity.

It is against this backdrop that the theory of boosting offers a compelling alternative. The starting
point is the realization that often, both in practice and in theory, it is easy to construct simple, yet
inaccurate rules-of-thumbs (or weak learners) that perform ever so slightly better than a random
classifier. A natural question then arises (paraphrased from [Sch90]’s abstract): can one convert such
mediocre learning rules into one that performs extremely well? Boosting algorithms offer a positive
resolution to this question by providing convenient and computationally efficient reductions that
aggregate such weak learners into a proficient learner with an arbitrarily high accuracy.

Realizable Boosting.
Consider the celebrated Adaboost algorithm [FS97] which operates in the
(noiseless) realizable binary classification setting. On any distribution consistent with a fixed labeling
function (or concept), a weak learner here promises an accuracy strictly better than half, since
guessing labels randomly gets any example correct with probability half. Given access to such a weak
learner and mrealizable boosting ≈(log |H|)/ε samples1, Adaboost makes ≈log 1/ε calls to the weak
learner to produce a classifier with (absolute) error at most ε on any distribution consistent with the
same labeling function. Thus, not only is Adaboost computationally efficient provided, of course,
such weak learners can be found, but also its sample complexity is no worse than that of ERM. This
underscores the fact that the realizable boosting methodology has the potential to offer computational
relief, without compromising on sample efficiency.

Agnostic Boosting.
In practice, realizability is an onerous assumption; it is too limiting for the
observed feature values alone to determine the label completely and deterministically, and that
such a relation can be perfectly captured by an in-class hypothesis. Agnostic learning forgoes such
assumptions. In their absence, bounds on absolute error are unachievable, e.g., when labels are
uniformly random irrespective of features, no classifier can achieve accuracy better than half. Instead,
in agnostic learning, the goal of the learner is to output a hypothesis with small excess error with
respect to the best in-class classifier. If an in-class hypothesis is perfect on a given distribution, this
relative error translates to an absolute error bound, thus generalizing the realizable case perfectly.
Indeed, such model agnosticism has come to be a lasting hallmark of modern machine learning.

Early attempts at realizing the promise of boosting in the agnostic setting were met with limited
success: while they did boost the weak learner’s accuracy, the final hypothesis produced was not
competitive with the best in-class hypothesis. We survey some of these in the related work section. A
later result, and the work most related to ours, is due to [KK09]. A weak learner in this setting returns
a classifier with a correlation against the true labels that is γ (say 0.1) times that of the best in-class

1In the introduction, for simplicity, we suppress polynomial dependencies in the weak learner’s edge γ, and
polylogarithmic terms. A recent sample complexity lower bound due to [GLR22] implies that this equivalence
continues to hold even taking into account poly(γ) dependencies as long as γ is not exponentially small.

hypothesis. Random guesses of the labels produce a correlation of zero; hence, a weak classifier
interpolates the performance of the best in-class hypothesis with that of a random one. Given access
to such a weak learner, the boosting algorithm of [KK09] makes ≈1/ε2 calls to the weak learner
and draws magnostic boosting ≈(log |H|)/ε4 samples to produce a learning rule (not necessarily in the
hypotheses class, hence improper) with ε-excess error. The dependency of the sample complexity in
the target accuracy is thus quadratically worse than that of ERM. This gap persists untarnished for
other known agnostic boosting algorithms too. In this work, we seek to diminish this fundamental
gap and construct a more sample-efficient agnostic boosting algorithm.

Our main result is an efficient boosting algorithm that upon receiving ≈(log |H|)/ε3 samples
produces an improper learning rule with ε-excess error on the population loss. This is accomplished
by the careful reuse of samples across rounds of boosting. We also extend these guarantees to
infinite function classes, and give applications of our main result in reinforcement learning, and in
agnostically learning halfspaces, in each case improving known results. We detail key contributions
and technical challenges in achieving them next.

1.1
Contributions and technical innovations

Contribution 1: Sample-efficient Agnostic Booster. We provide a new potential-based agnostic
boosting algorithm (Algorithm 1) that achieves ε-excess error when given a γ-weak learner operating
with a base class B. In Theorem 4, we prove that the sample complexity of this new algorithm scales
as (log |B|)/γ3ε3, improving upon all known approaches to agnostic boosting. See Table 1.

A key innovation in our algorithm design and the source of our sample efficiency is the careful
recursive reuse of samples between rounds of boosting, via a second-order estimator of the potential
in Line 5.II. In contrast, [KK09] draws fresh samples for every round of boosting.

A second coupled innovation, this time in our analysis, is to circumvent a uniform convergence
argument on the boosted hypothesis class, which would otherwise result in a sample complexity that
scales as ≈1/ε4. Indeed, the algorithm in [BCHM20] reuses the entire training dataset across all
rounds of boosting. This approach succeeds in boosting the accuracy on the empirical distribution;
however, success on the population distribution now relies on a uniform convergence (or sample
compression) argument on the boosted class, the complexity of which grows linearly with the number
of rounds of boosting since boosting algorithms are inevitably improper (i.e., output a final hypothesis
by aggregating weak learners, hence outside the base class). Instead, we use a martingale argument
on the smaller base hypothesis class to show that the empirical distributions constructed by our
data reuse scheme and fed to the weak learner track the performance of any base hypothesis on the
population distribution. This is encapsulated in Lemma 6.

Finally, while we follow the potential-based framework laid in [KK09], we find it necessary to
alter the branching logic dictating what gets added to the ensemble at every step. At each step, the
algorithm makes progress via including the weak hypothesis or making a step “backward” via adding
in a negation of the sign of the current ensemble. We note that there is a subtle error in [KK09] (see
Appendix A), that although for their purposes is rectifiable without a change in the claimed sample
complexity, leads to 1/ε4 sample complexity here in spite of the above modifications. At the leisure
of 1/ε4 sample complexity, the fix is to test which of these alternatives fares better by drawing fresh
samples every round. However, given a smaller budget, the error of the negation of the sign of the
ensemble, which lies outside the base class, is not efficiently estimable. Instead, in Line 9 we give a
different branching criteria that can be evaluated using the performance of the weak hypothesis on
past data alone.

Contribution 2: Trading off Sample and Oracle Complexity. Although Theorem 4 offers an
unconditional improvement on the sample complexity, it makes more calls to the weak learners than
previous works. To rectify this, we give a second guarantee on the performance of Algorithm 1 in
Theorem 9 (in Appendix B), with the oracle complexity matching that of known results. The resultant
sample complexity improves known results for all practical (i.e., sub-constant) regimes of ε. This is
made possible by a less well known variant of Freedman’s inequality [Pin94, Pin20] that applies to
random variables bounded with high probability.

Contribution 3: Extension to Infinite Classes. Although in our algorithm the samples fed to the
weak leaner are independent conditioned on past sources of randomness, our relabeling and data reuse
across rounds introduces complicated inter-dependencies between samples. For example, a sample
drawn in the past can simultaneously be used as is in the present round (i.e., in Line 5.I), in addition
to implicitly being used to modify the label of a different sample via the weak hypothesis it induced
in the past (i.e., in Line 5.II). Thus, the textbook machinery of extending finite hypothesis results to
infinite class applicable to IID samples via symmetrization and Rademacher complexity (see, e.g.,
[SSBD14, MRT18, BBL05]) is unavailable to us. Instead, we first derive L1 covering number based
bounds in Theorem 19 (in Appendix F). Through a result in empirical process theory [VDVW97],
we translate these to a VC(B)/γ3ε3 sample complexity bound, where VC(B) is the VC dimension
of class B, in Theorem 5.

Contribution 4: Applications in Reinforcement Learning and Agnostic Learning of Halfspaces.
Building on earlier reductions from reinforcement learning to supervised learning [KL02], [BHS22]
initiated the study of function-approximation compatible reinforcement learning, given access to
a weak learner over the policy class. By applying our agnostic booster to this setting, we improve
their sample complexity by poly(ε, γ) factors for binary-action MDPs, as detailed in Table 2. Also,
following [KK09], we apply our agnostic boosting algorithm to the problem of learning halfspaces
over the Boolean hypercube and exhibit improved boosting-based results in Theorem 8.

Contribution 5: Experiments. In preliminary experiments in Section 7, we demonstrate that the
sample complexity improvements of our approach do indeed manifest in the form of improved
empirical performance over previous agnostic boosting approaches on commonly used datasets.

Related work

The possibility of boosting was first posed in [KV94], and was resolved positively in a remarkable
result due to [Sch90] for the realizable case. The Adaboost algorithm [FS97] paved the way for its
practical applications (notably in [VJ01]). We refer the reader to [SF13] for a comprehensive text that
surveys the many facets of boosting, including its connections to game theory and online learning.
See also [HLR23, GLR22, AGHM21] for recent developments.

The fact that Adaboost and its natural variants are brittle in presence of label noise and lack of
realizability [LS08] prompted the search for boosting algorithms in the realizable plus label noise
[DIK+21, KS03] and agnostic learning models [BDLM01, MM02, KMV08, Kal07, CBC16]. In
general, these boosting models are incomparable: although agnostic learning implies success in the
random noise model, agnostic weak learning also constitutes a stronger assumption. Early agnostic
boosting results could not boost the learner’s accuracy to match that of the best in-class hypothesis;
this limitation was tied to their notion of agnostic weak learning. Our work is most closely related to
[KK09, Fel10]; we use the same notion of agnostic weak learning.

Boosting has also been extended to the online setting. [BKL15, CLL12, JGT17] study boosting in the
mistake bound (realizable) model, while [BCHM20, RT22, HS21] focus on regret minimization. Our
scheme of data reuse is inspired by variance reduction techniques [SLRB17, JZ13, FLLZ18, ABS23]
in convex optimization, although there considerations of uniform convergence and generalization are
absent, and our algorithm does not admit a natural gradient descent interpretation.

performance criterion we consider is the 0-1 loss over the true labels and the classifier’s predictions.

lD(h) = E(x,y)∼D [1(h(x) ̸= y)] = Pr(x,y)∼D[h(x) ̸= y]

Relatedly, one may measure the correlation between the classifier’s predictions and the true labels.

corrD(h) = E(x,y)∼D [yh(x)]

Note that for signed binary labels, we have that lD(h) = 1

2(1 −corrD(h)). Therefore, these notions
are equivalent in that a classifier that maximizes the correlation with true labels also minimizes the
0-1 loss, and vice versa, even in a relative error sense.

Definition 1 (Agnostic Weak Learner). A learning algorithm is called a γ-agnostic weak learner with
sample complexity m : R+ × R+ →N ∪{+∞} with respect to a hypothesis class H and a base
hypothesis class B if, for any ε0, δ0 > 0, upon being given m(ε0, δ0) independently and identically
distributed samples from any distribution D′ ∈∆(X × {±1}), it can output a base2 hypothesis
W ∈B such that with probability 1 −δ0 we have

corrD′(W) ≥γ max
h∈H corrD′(h) −ε0.

As remarked in [KK09], typically m(ε, δ) = O((log |B|/δ)/ε2), and we use this fact in compiling
Table 1. However, following [KK09, BCHM20], we state our main result for fixed ε0, δ0 in Theorem 4,
where a necessary and irreducible ε0 term shows up in our final accuracy.

Although not explicitly mentioned in our weak learning definition, our algorithm falls within the
distribution-specific boosting framework [KK09, Fel10]. In particular, like previous work on agnostic
boosting, Algorithm 1 can be implemented by relabeling examples, instead of adaptively reweighing
them. Thus, the overall marginal distribution of any D′ fed to the learner on the feature space X
is the same as that induced by the population distribution D on X. Under such promise on inputs,
distribution-specific weak learners may be easier to find.

Notations. Given two functions f, g : X →R and generic scalars α, β ∈R, we use af +bg to denote
a function such that (αf + βg)(x) = αf(x) + βg(x) for all x ∈X. Given a function f : X →R,
we take sign(f) to be a function such that for all x ∈X, sign(f)(x) = 1(f(x) ≥0) −1(f(x) < 0).
Define a filtration sequence {Ft : t ∈N≥0}, where Ft capture all source of randomness the algorithm
is subject to in the first t iterations. For brevity, we define Et[·] = E[·|Ft]. For any feature-label

We can use this to assign a population potential to any real-valued hypothesis H : X →R as

ΦD(H) = E(x,y)∼D [ϕ(yH(x)] .

To maximize correlation between true labels and the hypothesis H’s outputs, one wants H(x) > 0
whenever y = +1 for most samples drawn from the underlying distribution. Since ϕ is a monoton-
ically decreasing function, equivalently, higher classifier accuracy typically corresponds to lower
values of population potential. However, there are limits to the utility of this argument: a low value of
the potential alone does not translate to successful learning. In agnostic learning, one is concerned not
with the error of the learned classifier per se, but with its excess error over the best in-class hypothesis.
We will provide a precise relation between the potential and the excess error in Lemma 3.

We will use the following properties of ϕ (proved in Appendix C). Going forward, these will be
the sole characteristics of ϕ we will appeal to. The potential we use is similar to the one used in
[KK09, Dom00], but has been modified to remove a jump discontinuity in the second derivative at
z = 0 as our approach requires a twice continuously differentiable potential.
Lemma 2. We make the following elementary observations about ϕ:

I. ϕ is convex and in C2, i.e., it is two-times continuously differentiable everywhere.
II. ϕ is non-negative on R and ϕ(0) = 2.
III. For all z ∈R, ϕ′(z) ∈[−1, 0]. Further, for any z < 0, ϕ′(z) = −1.

IV. ϕ is 1-smooth, i.e., ∀z ∈R, ϕ′′(z) ≤1.

For any real-valued hypotheses H, h and g on X, to ease analysis, we introduce

Φ′
D(H, h) = E(x,y)∼D[ϕ′(yH(x))yh(x)],

Φ′′
D(H, h, g) = E(x,y)∼D[ϕ′′(yH(x))h(x)g(x)].

Equivalently, Φ′
D(H, h) can be characterized as the D-induced semi inner product between the
functional derivative ∂ΦD(H)/∂H and h. But for ease of presentation, we forgo this formal
interpretation in favor of the literal one stated above.

---Page Break---
A key property of the above potential is stated in the next lemma (proved in Appendix C). It gives
us a strategy to control the relative error of the learned hypothesis, the quantity on the right, by
individually minimizing both terms on the left, as we discuss next.
Lemma 3. For any distribution D ∈∆(X × {±1}), real-valued hypothesis H : X →R, and binary
hypothesis h∗: X →{±1}, we have

Φ′
D(H, sign(H)) −Φ′
D(H, h∗) ≥corrD(h∗) −corrD(sign(H)).

Description of the algorithm. Each round of Algorithm 1 adds some multiple of either the weak
hypothesis Wt or −sign(Ht) to the current ensemble Ht; this choice is dictated by the empirical
correlation of the weak hypothesis on the dataset it was fed. The construction of the relabeled
distribution Dt via our data reuse scheme ensures that if any hypothesis in the base class B produces
sufficient correlation on it, its addition to the ensemble must decrease the potential Φ associated
with the ensemble. Concretely, as we prove in Lemma 6, for all h ∈B, corrDt(h) closely tracks
−Φ′(Ht, h). The key to our improved sample complexity is the fact that this invariant can be
maintained while sampling only S ≈1/γε fresh samples each round, by repurposing samples from
earlier rounds to construct the dataset fed to the weak learner. The mixing parameter σ controls the
proportion of these two sources of samples used to construct Dt.

However, this explanation is opaque when it comes to motivating the need for −sign(Ht). Let’s rectify
that: let h∗∈arg minh∈H corrD(h) be the best in-class hypothesis. If −Φ′
D(Ht, h∗) is sufficiently
large, so is corrDt(h∗) by Lemma 6, which assures us a non-negligible weak learning edge. As
such −Φ′
D(Ht, Wt) is large and the potential drops. If the weak hypothesis fails to make sufficient
progress, the algorithms adds −sign(Ht) to the ensemble, which, again by Lemma 6 corresponds
to decreasing the potential value by some function of −Φ′
D(Ht, −sign(Ht)) = Φ′
D(Ht, sign(Ht)),
using linearity of Φ′
D in its second argument. Thus, when run for sufficiently many iterations, because
the potential is bounded above at initialization both the terms on the left side of Lemma 3 must
become small. This then implies a bounded correlation gap between the best in-class hypothesis, and
the majority vote of the ensembles considered in some iteration; the last line picks the best of these.

4.1
Main result for finite hypotheses classes

The key feature of our algorithm is that it is designed to reuse samples across successive rounds of
boosting. The soundness of this scheme, which Lemma 6 substantiates, is based on the observation
that in each round Ht changes by a small amount, thereby inducing an incremental change in the
distribution fed to the weak learner. Although our algorithm needs a total number of iterations
comparable to [KK09], this data reuse lowers the number of fresh samples needed every iteration to
just 1/γε, instead of 1/γ2ε2, resulting in improved sample complexity, as we show next.
Theorem 4 (Main result for finite hypotheses class). Choose any ε, δ > 0. There exists a choice
of η, σ, T, τ, S0, S, m satisfying3 T = O((log |B|)/γ2ε2), η = O(γ2ε/log |B|), σ = η/γ, τ =
O(γε), S = O(1/γε), S0 = O(1/ε2), m = m(ε0, δ0) + O(1/γ2ε2) such that for any γ-agnostic

while drawing O((log |B|)/γ3ε3 + (log |B|)3/γ2ε2) samples.

Sketch of the analysis

In this section, we provide a brief sketch of the analysis outlined in the proof of Theorem 4. Our
intent is to convey the plausibility of a 1/ε3 sample complexity result, up to the exclusion of other
factors. Hence, ≈and ≲inequalities below only hold up to constants and polynomial factors in other
paramters, e.g., in γ, log |B|. Formal proofs are reserved for Appendix D.

Bounding the correlation gap (Theorem 4). A central tool in bounding the correlation gap is
Lemma 3. We want to ensure for some t, since our algorithm at the end picks the best one, that

−Φ′
D(Ht, −sign(Ht))
|
{z
}
want ≲ε

+ (−Φ′
D(Ht, h∗))
|
{z
}
want ≲ε

≥corrD(h∗) −corrD(sign(Ht)).

On the other hand, using 1-smoothness of ϕ, we can upper bound ΦD on successive iterates as
ΦD(Ht+1) ≤ΦD(Ht) + ηΦ′
D(Ht, ht) + η2/2γ2. Rearranging this to telescope the sum produces

−1

t=1(ΦD(Ht) −ΦD(Ht+1))

ηT

η
2γ2 ≤2

ηT +

2γ2

Hence, by setting a η ≈1/
√

T, we know that there exists a t where −Φ′
D(Ht, ht) ≲1/
√

T.

In Lemma 6, we establish that the core guarantee our data resue scheme provides: that for all h in the
base class B and for h∗, the correlation on the resampled distribution Dt constructed by the algorithm
tracks the previously stated quantity of interest −Φ′
D(Ht, ·).

Lemma 6. There exists a C > 0 such that with probability 1 −δ, for all t ∈[T] and h ∈B ∪{h∗},
we have

Using the definition of weak learner, we know that corrDt(h∗) ≲corrDt(Wt)/γ. Now, using
Lemma 6 twice and the linearity of Φ′
D(H, ·), we get

−Φ′
D(Ht, h∗) ≲corrDt(h∗) + εGen ≲corrDt(Wt)/γ + εGen ≲−Φ′
D(Ht, Wt/γ) + 2εGen.

Now, if at each step we could choose ht ∈{−sign(Ht), Wt/γ}, which ever maximized −Φ′
D(Ht, ·),
we would have for some t that

max{−Φ′
D(Ht, −sign(Ht)), −Φ′
D(Ht, h∗) −2εGen} ≤−Φ′
D(Ht, ht) ≲1/
√

T.

Alas, −sign(Ht) is not in B, thus corrDt(−sign(Ht)) can be really far from −Φ′
D(Ht, −sign(Ht)),
i.e., Lemma 6 does not apply to −sign(Ht). To circumvent this, instead of choosing the maximizer,
in the algorithm and in the actual proof, we use a relaxed criteria for choosing between Wt/γ and
−sign(Ht) that depends on the correlation of Wt on Dt alone, and hence can be efficiently evaluated.
The spirit of this modification is to adopt −sign(Ht) only if Wt by itself fails to make enough
progress, the threshold for which can be stated in the terms of target accuracy.

Generalization over B via sample reuse (Lemma 6). Here, we sketch a proof of Lemma 6 that ties
the previous proof sketch together, and forms the basis of our sample reuse scheme. Our starting point
is the following claim (Claim 10) that uses the fact that ϕ is second-order differentiably continuous to
arrive at the fact that for any t and h : X →R, we have

Φ′
D(Ht, h) ≈Φ′
D(Ht−1, h) + ηΦ′′
D(Ht−1, h, ht−1).

Simultaneously, using Et−1 to condition on the randomness in the first t −1 rounds, by construction,
our data reuse and relabeling scheme gives us

Et−1[corrDt(h)] ≈(1 −σ)corrDt−1(h) −
σ2

σ + η Φ′
D(Ht−1, h) −
ησ
σ + η Φ′′
D(Ht−1, h, ht−1).

Thus, suitably scaling and adding the two together, we get the identity that

Et−1[∆t] = Φ′
D(Ht, h) +

where ∆t = Φ′

corrDt(h). Thus, ∆t forms a martingale-like sequence; the sign
of ∆t is indeterminate. To establish concentration, we apply Freedman’s inequality, noting that
the conditional variance of the associated martingale difference sequence scales as 1/
√

S. A union
bound over B ∪{h∗} yields the claim. Relatedly, to reach a better oracle complexity in Theorem 9,
we show a uniform high-probability on the martingale difference sequence, and then apply a variant
of Freedman’s inequality [Pin94, Pin20] that can adapt to martingale difference sequences that are
bounded with high probability instead of almost surely.

Applications

In this section, we detail the implications of our results for previously studied learning problems.

6.1
Boosting for reinforcement learning

[BHS22] initiated the approach of boosting weak learners to construct a near-optimal policy for
reinforcement learning. Plugging Algorithm 1 into their meta-algorithm yields the following result for
binary-action MDPs, improving upon the sample complexity in [BHS22]. Here, V π is the expected
discounted reward of a policy π, V ∗is its maximum. β is the discount factor of the underlying
MDP, and C∞, D∞and E, Eν are distribution mismatch and policy completeness terms (related to
the inherent Bellman error). In the episodic model, the learner interacts with the MDP in episodes. In
the ν-reset model, the learner can seed the initial state with a fixed well dispersed distribution ν as a
means to exploration. See Appendix G for a complete statement of results and details of the setting.
Theorem 7 (Informal; stated formally in Theorem 22). Let W be a γ-weak learner for the policy
class Π operating with a base class B, with sample complexity m(ε0, δ0) = (log |B|/δ0)/ε2
0. Fix
tolerance ε and failure probability δ. In the episodic access model, there is an algorithm using
that uses the weak learner W to produce a policy π such that with probability 1 −δ, we have
V ∗−V π ≤(C∞E)/(1 −β)+ε, while sampling O((log |B|)/γ3ε4) episodes of length O((1−β)−1).
In the ν-reset access model, there is a setting of parameters such that Algorithm 2 when given access
to W produces a policy π such that with probability 1−δ, we have V ∗−V π ≤(D∞Eν)/(1 −β)2+ε,
while sampling O((log |B|)/γ3ε5) episodes of length O((1 −β)−1).

6.2
Agnostically learning halfspaces

We apply our algorithm in a black-box manner to agnostically learn halfspaces over the n-dimensional
boolean hypercube when the data distribution has uniform marginals on features. The aim is this
section is not to obtain the best known bounds, but rather to provide an example illustrating that
agnostic boosting is both a viable and flexible approach to construct agnostic learners, and where
our improvements carry over. Following [KK09], we use ERM over the parities of degree at most d,
for d ≈1/ε4, as our weak learners; the the weak learner’s edge here is γ = n−d. An application of
our boosting algorithm (proved in Appendix I) to this problem improves the sample complexity of
O(ε−8n80ε−4) indicated in [KK09].

9


---Page Break---
Theorem 8. Let D be any distribution over {±1}n × {±1} with uniform distribution over features.
By H = {sign(w⊤x −θ) : (w, θ) ∈Rn+1}, denote the class of halfspaces. There exists some d such
that running Algorithm 1 with ERM over parities of degree at most d produces a classifier h such
that lD(¯h) ≤minh∈H lD(h) + ε, while using O(ε−7n60ε−4) samples in npoly(1/ε) time.

Note that ERM over the class of halfspaces directly, although considerably more sample efficient,
takes (1/ε)poly(n) time, i.e., it is exponentially slower for moderate values of ε. There are known
statistical query lower bounds [DKZ20] requiring npoly(ε−1) queries for agnostic learning of halfspaces
with Gaussian marginals, suggesting that a broad class of algorithms, regardless of the underlying
parametrization, might not fare any better. For completeness, we note that a better sample complexity
is attainable by direct L1-approximations of halfspaces via low-degree polynomials [DGJ+10],
instead of the approach taken in [KK09, KOS04] and mirrored here which first constructs an L2-
approximation, but such structural improvements apply equally to presented and compared results.

7
Experiments

In Table 3, we report the results of preliminary experiments with Algorithm 1 against the ag-
nostic boosting algorithms in [KK09] and [BCHM20] as baselines on UCI classification datasets
[SWHB89, HRFS99, SED+88], using decision stumps [PVG+11] as weak learners. We also in-
troduce classification noise of 5%, 10% and 20% during training to measure the robustness of the
algorithms to label noise. Accuracy is estimated using 30-fold cross validation with a grid search
over the mixing weight σ and the number of boosters T. The algorithm in [KK09] does not reuse
samples between rounds, while [BCHM20] uses the same set of samples across all rounds. In contrast,
Algorithm 1 blends fresh and old samples every round, with σ controlling the proportion of each. See
Appendix J for additional details. We note that the Ionsphere dataset includes 351 samples, while
Diabetes contains 768, and Spambase contains 4601. The benefits of sample reuse are less stark in
a data-rich regime. This could explain some of the under-performance on Spambase, disregarding
which the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the alternatives.

from [KK09] and [BCHM20] on 6 datasets. The first column reports accuracy on the original datasets,
and the next three report performance with 5%, 10% and 20% label noise added during training. The

Conclusion

We give an agnostic boosting algorithm with a substantially lower sample requirement than ones
known, enabled by efficient recency-aware data reuse between boosting iterations. Improving our
oracle complexity or proving its optimality, and closing the sample complexity gap to ERM are
interesting directions for future work.

Appendix

Limitations.
The primary contribution of this work is theoretical. Extensively demonstrating the
empirical efficacy of the proposed approach and fully characterizing when it fares best is left to future
work. Further, in comparison to realizable boosting (with or without label noise), the existence of an
agnostic weak leaner here is a stronger assumption. Nevertheless, we believe, especially given the
recent interest in agnostic boosting, the current work presents a substantial and concrete improvement
over the state of the art, and is a first step in making agnostic boosting practical.

Organization of the appendix.
In Appendix A, we point out an error in the branching criteria in
[KK09]. Next, in Appendix B, we give a second guarantee on our algorithm that improves the oracle
complexity at a vanishing (in ε) cost to the sample complexity. In Appendices C and D, we prove the
main result and the lemmas leading up to it. Appendix E provides a proof of the improved result in
Appendix B. Appendix F furnishes a proof for the claims concerning extensions to infinite classes.
In Appendices G and H, we define the reinforcement learning setup, formally state the RL boosting
result along with accompanying algorithms, and prove it. Appendix I substantiates our improved
sample complexity bound for learning halfspaces. Finally, in Appendix J, we provide additional
experimental details, and Appendix K provides a practical guide for adapting the proposed algorithm.

A
Branching criteria in [KK09]

At a high level, the boosting algorithm in [KK09] is an iterative one, that adds either the weak
hypothesis or the negation of the sign of the present ensemble to the ensemble mixture in each of
the T ≈1/ε2 rounds. The algorithm makes use of samples to fulfill two objectives: (a) provide
m ≈1/ε2 samples to the weak learner to obtain a weak hypothesis that generalizes, (b) use s ≈1/ε2
samples to decide whether to add the weak hypothesis or the voting classifier to the current mixture,
by comparing the empirical performance on both on said samples. The algorithm uses fresh samples
for part (a) every round; this is sound and contributes Tm ≈1/ε4 to the net sample complexity.

However, as described in [KK09], the algorithm reuses the same s samples for part (b) across all
rounds. This means these s samples determine which of the two choices gets added to the mixture at
the end of the first step, and hence H1. In the next step, however, because H1 through relabelling of
new samples determines the weak hypothesis, these samples are no longer IID with respect to the
weak hypothesis or −sign(H1), since they have already played a demonstrable part in determining it.
This effects occur and compound at all time steps, not just the first. In the analysis, on top of page 7,
the analysis in [KK09] uses a Chernoff-Hoeffding bound to say that the performance of the weak
hypothesis and −sign(H1) on these s samples transfers approximately to the population. However,
this inequality may only be applied to IID random variables.

In the case of [KK09], there is a simple and satisfactory fix: resample these s examples from the
population distribution every round. The sample complexity, now T(m + s) instead of Tm + s,
remains O(1/ε4), and no change to the performance gurantee needs to be made.

In our adaptation, this highlights an additional challenge. Even if one were to sate the weak learner
with a total fewer number of samples, i.e., perform part (a) with fewer samples, through a uniform
convergence result on the base hypothesis (crucially, not the boosted hypothesis, whose complexity
grows with number of iterations), part (b) requires s fresh samples, and hence 1/ε4 samples in
total, in determining which of the weak hypothesis or −sign of the ensemble provides a greater
magnitude of descent. Here, note that −sign(Ht) lies outside the base class. To circumvent this,
we give a branching criteria to decide which component to add to the present mixture, based on
the performance of the weak hypothesis, the only component whose performance is estimable with
bounded generalization error, alone on the reused data. Concretely, we introduce a threshold τ to
choose the weak hypothesis, if it makes at least τ progress, and otherwise, choose −sign(Ht) even
if in truth it is worse than the weak hypothesis. This deviation requires careful handling in the proof.

Improved oracle complexity

Here, we provide a different result where Algorithm 1 makes O(1/γ2ε2) call to weak learner,
matching exatcly the oracle complexity of existing results, while drawing O((log |B|)/γ3ε3 +

14

(log |B|)3/γ2ε2) samples. Notice that the second term in the sample complexity has a smaller
order, whenever ε is sub-constant. The proof may be found in Appendix E.
Theorem 9 (Improved oracle complexity for finite hypotheses class). Choose any ε, δ > 0. There
exists a choice of η, σ, T, τ, S0, S, m satisfying T = O(1/γ2ε2), η = O(γ2ε), σ = η/γ, τ =
O(γε), S = O((log |B|)/γε + (log |B|)3), S0 = O(1/ε2), m = m(ε0, δ0) + O(1/γ2ε2) such that
for any γ-agnostic weak learning oracle (as defined in Definition 1) with fixed tolerance ε0 and
failure probability δ0, Algorithm 1 when run with the potential defined in (1) produces a hypothesis h

C
Proof of auxiliary lemmas

Proof of Lemma 2. Part 2 is evident from the definition. Taking care that right and left first (and
second) derivatives exist and are equal at z = 0, by explicit computation, we have

ϕ′(z) =
−1
if z ≤0,
−(z + 1)e−z
if z > 0,
ϕ′′(z) =
0
if z ≤0,
ze−z
if z > 0.

From this, one may immediately verify Part 1, since ϕ′′ is non-negative. Non-negativity of ϕ′′ also
implies that ϕ′ is non-decreasing, and hence, being clearly non-positive, is between [−1, 0]; this is
Part 3. By elementary calculus, ϕ′′ is maximize at z = 1 where it equals 1/e implying the conclusion
in Part 4.

Proof of Lemma 3. By the definition of Φ′
D, we have

Φ′
D(H, sign(H)) −Φ′
D(H, h∗) =E(x,y)∼D[ϕ′(yH(x))y(sign(H)(x) −h∗(x))]

=E(x,y)∼D[1(yH(x) ≥0)ϕ′(yH(x))y(sign(H)(x) −h∗(x))]

+ E(x,y)∼D[1(yH(x) < 0)ϕ′(yH(x))y(sign(H)(x) −h∗(x))].

Note that whenever yH(x) < 0, ϕ′(yH(x)) = −1, which Lemma 2.III attests to. On the other
hand, if yH(x) ≥0, since h∗is a binary classifier, ysign(H)(x) = 1 ≥yh∗(x), and since, again by
Lemma 2.III, ϕ′(yH(x)) ≥−1, we have in this case

ϕ′(yH(x))y(sign(H)(x) −h∗(x)) ≥−y(sign(H)(x) −h∗(x))

Plugging these into the previous derivation, we arrive at

Φ′
D(H, sign(H)) −Φ′
D(H, h∗) ≥E(x,y)∼D[1(yH(x) ≥0)y(h∗(x) −sign(H)(x))]

+ E(x,y)∼D[1(yH(x) < 0)y(h∗(x) −sign(H)(x))]

=E(x,y)∼D[y(h∗(x) −signH(x))]

=corrD(h∗) −corrD(sign(H)),

finishing the proof of the claim.

D
Proofs for the main result

Proof of Theorem 4. Let h∗∈arg minh∈H corrD(h). Using the update rule for Ht+1 and the fact
that ϕ is 1-smooth (Lemma 2.IV), we arrive at

ΦD(Ht+1) = E(x,y)∼D[ϕ(y(Ht(x) + ηht(x)))]

where we use the fact that ΦD(0) = 2, and that it is non-negative (Lemma 2.II).

Hence, ∃t ∈[T], such that −Φ′
D(Ht, ht) is small. Our proof strategy going forward is to use this fact
to imply that both the terms on left side of inequality in Lemma 3, namely, −Φ′
D(−sign(Ht)) and
−Φ′
D(Ht, h∗), are small for some t, implying a small correlation gap on the population distribution.

Note that if corrD′
t(Wt) ≥τ, the algorithm sets ht = Wt/γ, else it chooses ht = −sign(Ht). We
analyze these cases separately. For both, Lemma 6 which relates the empirical correlation on Dt with
Φ′
D will prove indispensable. Going forward, we will define εGen as indicated above to capture the
generalization error over the base hypothesis class.

For brevity of notation, we condition the analysis going forward on three events. Let EA be that event
that for all t, |corrDt(Wt) −corr b
D′
t(Wt)| ≤ε′/10. Since bD′
t is constructed from IID samples from

Dt, setting m ≥100/ε′2p

log T/δ, Pr(EA) ≥1−δ, by an application of Hoeffding’s inequality and
union bound over t. Here, note that unlike S setting a higher value of m doesn’t increase the number
of points sampled from D, since D′
t is resampled from already collected data. Similarly, denote by
EB the event that for all t, |corrD(sign(Ht)) −corr b
D0(sign(Ht))| ≤ε′′/10. Again, by Hoeffding’s
inequality and union bound over t, choosing S0 = 100/ε′′2p

log T/δ, we have Pr(EB) ≥1 −δ,
since the samples in bD0 were chosen independently of those used to compute Ht’s. Finally, we will
take the success of Lemma 6 (call this EC) for granted in the analysis below, for brevity of notation,
conditioning our analysis on all three events.

Case A: When ht = Wt/γ.
When this happens, corrDt(Wt) ≥corrD′
t(Wt) −ε′/10 ≥τ −ε′/10.

D(Ht, ·) is linear in its argument, we have

Proofs for improved oracle complexity

Proof of Theorem 9. The overall proof is similar to that of Theorem 4, with the exception of the
following bound on εGen, which we state now (and prove next) in a new lemma relating the empirical
correlation on Dt with Φ′
D. The principal difference between Lemma 6 and Lemma 15 is the presence
of a 1/
√

S in both terms on the right in Lemma 15, however this comes at the cost of a higher
polynomial dependence in log |B| in the second term on the right side of Lemma 15.

Lemma 15. There exists a C > 0 such that with probability 1 −δ, for all t ∈[T] and h ∈B ∪{h∗},
we have

Proof of Lemma 15. The proof of the present lemma is largely similar to that of Lemma 6, with two
exceptions: (a) we use a variant of Freedman’s inequality that applies when the martingale difference
sequences (for us, δ′

bound; (b) to apply this result, we establish a high probability upper bound on δ′

As before, adding (1 + η/σ) times the expression in Claim 11 to the the expansion of Φ′
D(Ht, h) in
Claim 10, we observe that Et−1[∆t] = (1 −σ)∆t−1, and hence conclude that ∆′
t = (1 −σ)−t∆t
forms a martingale sequence with respect to the {Ft : t ∈N≥0} filtration sequence. As shown in

Now, we state a variant of Freedman’s inequality that applies when martingale difference sequences
are bounded with high probability.

Theorem 16 (Freedman’s inequality with high probability bounds [Pin94, Pin20]). Fix a positive
integer n. Consider a real-valued martingale {Yk : k ∈Z≥0} with respect to some filtration sequence
{Σk : k ∈Z≥0}, and let {Xk : k ∈Z>0} be the associated difference sequence. Assume that the
difference sequence is uniformly bounded with high probability for some R, δ′:

To apply this variant of Freedman’s inequality, we establish a high probability bound on ∆′

However, this time, we note that, conditioned on Ft−1, A1 and A2 are averages of S zero-mean IID
random variables, where each constituent is absolutely bounded by one in magnitude (Lemma 2).

Note that since this statement holds true for all realizations in Ft−1 – in words, it is a statement about
the randomness in the present round alone – it remains true when not subject to such filtration’s, i.e.,
by marginalizing over Ft−1. A union bound over t now yields the claim

Proofs for extensions to infinite classes

Definition 18 (Covering number). Given a set F in linear space V, a semi norm ∥·∥on V, N(ε, F, ∥·∥)
is the size of the smallest set G such that for all f ∈F, there exists a g ∈G such that ∥f −g∥≤ε.

Proof of Theorem 5. First, we state (and subsequently prove) the following sample complexity result
using L1 covering numbers. We note that it may be possible to improve this result for specific classes
of functions, i.e., monotonic functions, by applying chaining techniques [Dud74] to L2 distances.

Theorem 19 (Main result for Covering Number). Define L1,DX (f, g) = Ex∼DX [|f(x) −g(x)|], for
any two functions f, g : X →R, where DX is the marginal distribution of D on the features set X.
There exists a setting of parameters such that for any for any γ-agnostic weak learning oracle with
fixed tolerance ε0 and failure probability δ0, Algorithm 1 produces a hypothesis h such that with
probability 1 −10δ0T −10δT,

corrD(h) ≥max

while making T = O((log N(ε/10γ, B, L1,DX ))/γ2ε2) calls to the weak learning oracle, and
sampling TS + S0 = O((log N(ε/10γ, B, L1,DX ))/γ3ε3) labeled examples from D.

The claim follows immediately by the application of the following result from [VDVW97] to place an
upper bound of the L1 covering in terms of the VC dimension in Theorem 19. This result originally
due to [Hau95] was established for distances defined by n-point empirical measures, for some finite
n. The version in [VDVW97] works on arbitrary distributions, by first proving that by a result proven
for empirical-type measures transfers without loss to any distribution.

Theorem 20 (Theorem 2.6.4 in [VDVW97]). There exists a universal constant C such that for any
VC class B, any probability measure DX , and 0 ≤ε ≤1,

This concludes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 19. We first invoke Lemma 6 but on a minimal εCov-cover (say BCov) of B with
respect to the L1,DX semi norm to get that there exists a C > 0 such that with probability 1 −δ, for
all t ∈[T] and h ∈BCov ∪{h∗}, we have

Fix any g ∈B. Now, by virtue of the εCov-cover, there exists a h ∈B such that L1,DX =
Ex∼DX [|f(x) −g(x)|] ≤εCov. Now, using the definition of Φ′
D and a uniform (absolute) upper
bound on ϕ′ (Lemma 2.III), we get

|Φ′
D(Ht, h) −Φ′
D(Ht, g)| = |E(x,y)∼D[yϕ′(yHt(x))(h(x) −g(x))]|

≤E(x,y)∼D[|h(x) −g(x)|]

≤Ex∼DX [|h(x) −g(x)|] ≤εCov.

Similarly, using the fact that the marginal distribution of Dt on X is the same as DX , we get

|corrDt(h) −corrDt(g)| ≤Ex∼DX [|h(x) −g(x)|] ≤εCov.

Combining these, we have that with probability 1 −δ, for all t ∈[T] and h ∈BCov ∪{h∗}, we have

Boosting for reinforcement learning

MDP. In this section, we consider a Markov Decision Process M = (S, A, r, P, β, µ0), where S is
a set of states, A = {±1} is a binary set of actions, r : S × A →[0, 1] determines the (expected)
reward at any state-action pair, P : S × A →S captures the transition dynamics of the MDP,
i.e., P(s′|s, a) is the probability of moving to state s′ upon taking action a at state s, β ∈[0, 1) is
the discount factor, and µ0 is the initial state distribution. Without any loss, one may restrict their
consideration to Markovian policies [Put14] of the form π : S →∆(A), where an agent at each
point in time chooses action a at state s independently with probability π(a|s).

For any state s ∈S, action a ∈A, and distribution µ ∼∆(S) over states, define state-action and

2: Initialize a policy π0 ∈Π arbitrarily.
3: for t = 1 to T do
4:
Run Algorithm 1 to get π′

(ignore bQ) by executing the current policy πt−1 starting from the initial state distribution µ.
5:
Update πt = (1 −ηt)πt−1 + ηtπ′

6: end for
7: Run each policy πt for P rollouts to compute an empirical estimate d
V πt of the expected return.
8: return π = πt′ where t′ = arg maxt d
V πt.

We will abbreviate V π
µ0 = V π, since it captures the value of any policy starting from the canonical
starting state distribution. Finally, the occupancy measure µπ
µ′ induced by a policy π starting from an
initial state distribution µ′ is stated below. We will take µπ = µπ
µ0 as a matter of convention.

Accessing the MDP. Following [BHS22], we consider two models of accessing the MDP; we will
furnish a different result for each. In the episodic model, the learner interacts with the MDP in a
limited number of episodes of reasonable length (i.e., ≈(1 −β)−1), and the starting state of MDP is
always drawn from µ0. In the second, termed rollouts with ν-resets, the learner’s interaction is still
limited to a small number of episodes, however, the MDP now samples its starting state from ν. It is
important to stress that in both cases, the learner’s objective is the same, to maximize V π starting
from µ0. However, ν could be more spread out over the state space than µ0, and provide an implicit
source of explanation, and the learner’s guarantee as shown next benefits from its dependence on a
milder notion of distribution mismatch in this case.

Weak Leaner. For convenience, we restate our weak learning definition, this time using π to denote
policies, instead of h. Note that our definition is equivalent to that used by [BHS22], because for
binary actions a random policy induces an accuracy of half regardless of the distribution over features
and labels. One may use the identity corrD(π) = 1 −2lD(π) to observe this. In fact, our assumption
of weak learning might ostensibly seem weaker, since it operates with 0/1 losses (equivalently,
correlations), whereas the losses in previous work are assumed general linear. However, for binary
actions, this difference is insubstantial and purely stylistic.
Definition 21 (Agnostic Weak Learner). A learning algorithm is called a γ-agnostic weak learner
with sample complexity m : R+ × R+ →N ∪{+∞} with respect to a policy class Π and a base
policy class B if, for any ε0, δ0 > 0, upon being given m(ε0, δ0) independently and identically
distributed samples from any distribution D′ ∈∆(X × {±1}), it can output a base policy W ∈B
such that with probability 1 −δ0 we have

corrD′(W) ≥γ max
π∈Π corrD′(π) −ε0.

Policy Completeness and Distribution Mismatch. π∗∈arg maxπ V π be a reward maximizing
policy, and V ∗be its value. Let Π be the convex hull of the boosted policy class, i.e., the outputs of
the boosting algorithm. For any state distribution µ′, define the policy completeness Eµ′ term as

Eµ′ = max
π∈Π min
π′∈Π Es∼µπ
µ′[max
a∈A Qπ(s, a) −Ea∼π′(·|s)Qπ(s, a)].

In words, this term captures how well the greedy policy improvement operator is approximated by
Π in an state-averaged sense over the distribution induces by any policy in Π. Finally, we define
distribution mismatch coefficients below.

C∞= max
π∈Π ∥µπ∗/µπ∥∞,
D∞= ∥µπ∗/ν∥∞.

Theorem 22. Let W be a γ-weak learner for the policy class Π operating with a base class B, with
sample complexity m(ε0, δ0) = (log |B|/δ0)/ε2
0. Fix tolerance ε and failure probability δ. In the
episodic access model, there is a setting of parameters such that Algorithm 2 when given access to
W produces a policy π such that with probability 1 −δ, we have

Proofs for boosting for reinforcement learning

Proof of Theorem 22. The proof here closely follows that of Theorem 7 in [BHS22], and we only
indicate the necessary departures. Since we utilize the outer algorithm from previous work, the
associated guarantees naturally carry over. The departure comes from our substitution of the internal
boosting procedure in Algorithm 2 with Algorithm 1; in fact, in its place [BHS22] use a result of
[HS21] which can be seen as a generalization of [KK09], e.g., it uses fresh samples for every round
of boosting, to other non–binary action sets preserving its ≈1/ε4 sample complexity. In this view,
the improvement in sample complexity by using the present paper’s apprach seems natural.

For the episodic model, applying the second part of Theorem 9 in [BHS22], while noting the
smoothness of V π, and combining the result with Lemma 18 and Lemma 11 in [BHS22], we have
with probability 1 −Tδ

where π′
t is the output of the internal boosting algorithm in Line 4 of Algorithm 2, and Dt is the
distribution produced by Algorithm 3 with πt−1 selected as the policy for execution. Here, by explicit
calculation, noting a′ ∼Unif(A), one may verify for any t that

E(s, b
Q,y)∼Dt[y|s] = 1 −β

E(s, b
Q,y)∼Dt[ bQ(+1) −bQ(−1)|s].

Recall that A = {±1}, and hence π : S →∆({±1}). Hence, for any policy pair π1, π2 we have

Q,y)∼DtEa1∼π1(s)Ea2∼π2(s)[y(a1 −a2)].

Therefore, all we need to ensure is that output of Algorithm 1 as instantiated in Algorithm 2 every
round has an excess correlation gap over the best policy Π no more that (1 −β)2ε/C∞, which
Algorithm 1 assures us can be accomplished with O

Proofs for agnostic learning of halfspaces

Proof of Theorem 8. Using an approximation result of [KOS04], we observe that ERM on the Fourier
basis χS(x) = Q

i∈S xi, namely parities on subsets S, can be used to produce a weak learner. This
result guarantees that an n-dimensional halfspace can be approximated with uniform weighting on the
hypercube to ε2 ℓ2-error using degree-limited Bn,d = {±χS : |S| ≤d} as a basis, where d = 20ε−4.
As a result, at least one h ∈Bn,d must have high correlation.

Lemma 23 (Lemma 5 in [KMV08]). Let D be any data distribution over {±1}n × {−1, 1} with
marginal distribution Unif({±1}n) on the features. For any fixed ε and d = 20ε−4, there exists some
h ∈Bn,d such

corrD(h) ≥maxc∈H corrD(c) −ε

nd

The result follows directly from the preceding lemma, which provides a weak learner for the task,
and Theorem 4. We note that |Bn,d| < nd and γ = n−d, so

Additional experimental details

For all algorithms, we perform a grid search on the number of boosting rounds with T ∈{25, 50, 100}.
For Algorithm 1 we search over σ ∈{0.1, 0.25, 0.5} as well. Rather than using a fixed η, our imple-
mentation uses an adaptive step-size scheme proportional to the empirical correlation on the current re-
labeled distribution. Our experiments were performed using the fractional relabeling scheme stated in
[KK09], intended to reduce the stochasticity the algorithm is subject to. In particular, rather than sam-
pling labels, we provide both (x, y) and (x, −y) in our dataset with weights 1+wt(x,y)

2
and 1−wt(x,y)

2
respectively. For the baselines, wt(x, y) = −ϕ′
mad(Hty) = min(1, exp(−Ht(x)y)), where ϕmad is
the Madaboost potential [Dom00]. For the implementation of the proposed algorithm, for greater
reproducibility, we use the weighting function wt(x, y) = (1 −σ)ϕ′(Ht−1(x)y) −ϕ′(Ht(x)y),
which is analytically equivalent to computing the expectation of pt(x, y, η′) in Algorithm 1 over
η′ ∼Unif[0, η]. The runtime used for all experiments was a Google Cloud Engine VM instance with
2 vCPUs (Intel Xeon 64-bit @ 2.20 GHz) and 12 GB RAM.

Guide for practical adaptation of Algorithm 1

For many hyperparamters, our theory provides strong clues (the link between η and σ). Briefly, in
practice, given a fixed dataset with mtotal data points, there are two parameters we think a practitioner
should concern herself with: the mixing parameter σ and the number of rounds of boosting T, while
the rest can be determined, or at least guessed well, given these. The first choice σ dictates the relative

26


---Page Break---
weight ascribed to reused samples across rounds of boosting, while T, apart from determining the
running time and generalization error, implicitly limits the algorithm to using mtotal/T fresh samples
each round. For η, one may use the adaptive step-size schedule suggested in the previous section,
which also obviates the difficulty of selecting γ. Similarly, our branching criteria, whose necessity is
explained in Appendix A, although theoretically both sound and necesssary, is overly conservative.
In practice, we believe choosing the better of −sign(Ht) and Wt whichever produces the greatest
empirical distribution on the relabeled distribution will perform best.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All claims are backed by theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All assumptions are stated explicitly. Further, the appendix contains a separate
section on limitations of the present work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

28


---Page Break---
Justification: Please see the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the additional materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

29


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the additional materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the additional materials and the experiments section for details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the table in the main paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

30


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: It does.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The present work falls within the realm of foundational research, and is in its
basic nature theoretical.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

31


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Not applicable.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All datasets used are cited.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

32


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets are introduced in the present work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
