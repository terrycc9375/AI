Abstract

We study the problem of retrieving accurate correspondence through multi-scale
consistency (MSC) for robust point cloud registration. Existing works in a coarse-
to-fine manner either suffer from severe noisy correspondences caused by unreliable
coarse matching or struggle to form outlier-free coarse-level correspondence sets.
To tackle this, we present Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (HST), a pruned tree structure
designed to hierarchically measure the local consistency of each coarse correspon-
dence across multiple feature scales, thereby filtering out the local dissimilar ones.
In this way, we convert the modeling of MSC for each correspondence into a BFS
traversal with pruning of a K-ary tree rooted at the superpoint, with its K nearest
neighbors in the feature pyramid serving as child nodes. To achieve efficient prun-
ing and accurate vicinity characterization, we further propose a novel overlap-aware
Sinkhorn Distance, which retains only the most likely overlapping points for local
measurement and next level exploration. The modeling process essentially involves
traversing a pair of HSTs synchronously and aggregating the consistency measures
of corresponding tree nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate HST consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

Point cloud registration is a crucial task in 3D computer vision that in-
volves aligning a pair of partially overlapped point clouds to create a
unified scene representation. The most common approaches [1, 2, 3]
follow the two stage technical roadmap, i.e., matching and trans-
formation. They first form a set of high confident correspondences
through repeatable feature descriptors, and then a robust estimator is
utilized to calculate the rigid transformation. Although extensively
studied over the past decades, the task remains challenging due to
limited overlap, severe noise, etc.

Recent advances [4, 5, 6, 7] have made substantial progress in
learning-based methods. The key idea is to train a shared network
to extract point-wise features and establish reliable correspondences
based on them. Inspired by the progress in image registration counter-
parts [8, 9, 10, 11], a coarse-to-fine strategy [12, 13] is leveraged to
avoid keypoint detection and unrepeatable correspondence searching.
It has demonstrated superior performance over the state-of-the-art
methods. They establish sparse superpoint correspondences on the
downsampled input point clouds (coarse level) and then refine them to point level to yield dense point

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method. The overall architecture (Top) is designed in a coarse-
to-fine manner, which extracts coarse correspondences and then refines them to point level. Our
proposed method contains the following parts: 1. Local exploration (Left) extracts local patch pairs
for each putative match in multiple scales from the feature pyramid (Sec. 3.2.1). 2. Patch Overlap
Prediction module (Bottom Middle) is then adopted to predict the overlap points between patch pairs
(Sec. 3.2.2). 3. Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance (Bottom Right) measures the patch similarity by
focusing on potential overlap points (Sec. 3.2.3). Finally, we repeat the above operations across the
layers to construct the Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (Left) in a BFS way. The process of modeling
MSC essentially involves traversing a pair of HSTs and then aggregating the consistency measures of
the corresponding tree nodes (Sec. 3.2.4).

correspondences (fine level). Therefore, the accuracy of coarse correspondences directly impacts
that of fine correspondences [12, 14]. Intuitively, A pair of incorrect coarse matches may introduce
potential outlier fine correspondences, thereby influencing the final transformation estimation.

Prior works try to alleviate this problem from two perspectives. The first [13, 14, 15] attempts to
nip it in the bud during coarse matching. They adapt the Transformer [16] to unordered point cloud
representation to mitigate matching ambiguity. A series of embeddings are proposed to facilitate
learning discriminative geometric consistency in both explicit and implicit manners for more accurate
matching. The second [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] ignores the inaccuracy in coarse stage and directly
filters out the outlier correspondences at fine stage, known as outlier removal methods. Such methods
distinguish between inlier and outlier by developing well-designed compatibilities [23, 24, 21, 22] to
characterize the affinity relationship between correspondences in geometric or feature space. Though
the above techniques have achieved surprising performances, both of them still suffer from noise and
low overlap. Specifically, the first only considers coarse-level feature interactions, lacking exploration
of finer-scale local consistency. Erroneous correspondences are more likely to occur, especially in
low-overlapping scenarios. The second suffers from inaccurate outlier filtering when confronted with
a set of high outlier rates correspondences caused by severe noise. Consequently, the outliers, which
arise primarily from inaccurate matching in the coarse stage, would inevitably be involved in the
transformation estimation step, ultimately resulting in failed registration.

To tackle the above problems, we propose the Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree with overlap-aware
Sinkhorn distance to model the multi-scale consistency (MSC) of correspondences for more accurate
coarse-level matching. Multi-scale consistency analysis, due to its innate capability to analyze patterns
at different levels of detail, has been variously applied to matching- [25, 26, 27] and retrieval- [28, 29]
related vision tasks. However, in point cloud registration, where the irregular nature of data hinders
the promotion of corresponding image MSC analysis methods, leveraging them for more reliable
correspondence retrieval remains unexplored. Given that MSC characterizes the local consistency
of matches across multiple feature scales, which effectively addresses the challenge of inaccurate
matches at the coarse stage, we aim to tackle them both. The key idea is to hierarchically evaluate
the vicinity geometric similarity of each correspondence at multiple scales using Sinkhorn distance
[30] and filter out highly dissimilar coarse matches. Specifically, we employ Local Exploration to

extract local patches at each correspondence’s next decoder
layer. Subsequently, the overlap-aware Sinkhorn distance (over-
lap SD) measures the patch differences (see Fig. 3) by focusing
the Sinkhorn operation on potential overlap points within the
patch, disregarding the non-overlapping ones. This significantly
enhances the robustness to noise points while achieving com-
putational savings. Following this, a subset of the most likely
overlapping points is retained for further local exploration and
overlap SD measurement. This repetitive process refines the
multi-scale local consistency of each correspondence as the
scale becomes finer. Finally, we aggregate the consistency mea-
sures across all scales and utilize probabilistic search to select
the most reliable coarse correspondences robustly. An overview of our method can be found in Fig. 1.

To sum up, our main contributions are three-fold:

• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale consistency into point
cloud registration task to mitigate the effects of low overlap and high noise.
• We propose a method for modeling multi-scale consistency called HST, which character-
izes the similarity of potential overlapping points in the vicinity areas layer by layer and
aggregates them into multi-scale consistency.
• We introduce an overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance to focus optimal transport processes
only on potential overlapping points, significantly enhancing the robustness of consistency
calculations while reducing solution complexity.

Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrate our scene-agnostic
superiority. HST significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on Registration Recall on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

Correspondence-based point cloud registration.
Early correspondence-based registration meth-
ods follow the detect-and-transform pipelines. A series of local geometric descriptors [1, 31, 32, 33]
are proposed to detect repeatable salient points of point cloud pairs. Then point-level correspondences
[5, 4, 6] are established to recover the transformation between point clouds through a robust estimator
[20, 21, 22]. Recently, detector-free methods [12, 13, 15] to avoid unrepeatable keypoint detection
are proposed. They introduce a coarse-to-fine manner derived from 2D image matching [8, 9, 10, 11]
to shrink the correspondence searching space. It first extracts full and reliable matches on coarse-
resolution features and then refines them on the corresponding local patch from finer resolution. It’s
becoming prevalent due to its excellent matching accuracy and computational efficiency. Our method
follows the technical roadmap of detector-free methods and focuses on improving the correspondence
reliability of the coarse phase.

Coarse-to-fine matching.
Recent works [8, 9, 10, 11] advance 2D image matching by leveraging a
coarse-to-fine fashion to avoid unrepeatable keypoint detection while increasing matching reliability,
known as detector-free methods. DualRC-Net [8] extracts coarse feature maps to form complete
correlations and generate pixel-level matches with the help of fine features. Patch2pix [9] refines
coarse patch matches by regressing fine pixel matches from local regions. Loftr [10] and CasMTR
[11] introduce an attention mechanism [16] to search for accurate low-resolution correspondences
and then establish dense matching based on informative high-resolution local patches.

Multi-scale consistency.
The core idea of multi-scale consistency is to evaluate the similarity
of matches across multiple feature scales. The criterion under this for evaluating an inlier match
is that each spatial resolution of feature pyramids should maintain a certain degree of similarity.
BiseNet [34] utilizes an auxiliary loss to supervise the consistency between multi-scale features and
ground-truth to enhance the feature representation. MSCAN [28] leverages a multi-scale attention
module to capture features of different scales and aggregates them into a global descriptor for robust
image retrieval. ACMM [25] conducts the multi-scale geometric consistency to refine depth maps at
each scale, reaching satisfying performance.

Problem Statement

Given two point clouds X =

xi ∈R3 | i = 1..N
	
, and Y =

yj ∈R3 | i = 1..M
	
, the goal is to
recover a rigid transformation T(R, t) that aligns the two point clouds with rotation R ∈SO(3) and
translation t ∈R3. We utilize the KPConv-FPN [33] as the backbone and leverage geometric self-
and cross-attention [13] to estimate C pairs of coarse correspondences for registration in a coarse-to-
fine manner [12, 13]. Our goal is to remove the outlier correspondences from the above estimated
correspondences for further accurate and robust registration. The key idea is to hierarchically model
the vicinity similarity at multiple scales between each correspondence.

3.2
Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree

We first propose Multi-scale Consistency (MSC) for coarse level correspondences, which assumes that
each correspondence contains similar local features at different down-/up-sampling scales. I.e., given
a pair of points x and y with their local patch features at L scales to be {FX
(1), FX
(2), ..., FX
(L)}
and {FY
(1), FY
(2), ..., FY
(L)}, then x and y is an putative inlier correspondence only they satisfy:
XL

l=1 dist(FX
(l), FY
(l)) < θd, l ∈[1, L],
(1)

where dist(·) is the pre-defined metric for measuring the patch difference and θd is the threshold.

We further propose the Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree with Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance to model
the MSC of correspondences. It first applies Local Exploration (Sec. 3.2.1) to extract local patch at
next finer scale from the feature pyramid. Then the Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance (Sec. 3.2.3)
picks the overlap points from patches using Patch Overlap Prediction (Sec. 3.2.2) module and
performs Sinkhorn Distance with overlap-aware marginal initialization on them. These two steps are
performed layer-wisely in a hierarchical tree way called the Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (Sec. 3.2.4).

3.2.1
Local Exploration

KPConv-FPN [33] varies point density by altering the size of grid cells at each layer to form feature
pyramids. Moreover, the features from FPN decoder provide sufficient information to analyze the
vicinity similarity between correspondences due to the skip connections. Consequently, we perform
nearest-neighbor exploration [35] on the match’s neighboring points from subsequent decoder layer.

Given point cloud X(l) from the l-th layer of decoder, and its next layer point cloud X(l+1), where
0 ≤l ≤L −1 and L is the number of decoder. We have k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search to obtain
the local patch P(l+1)

3.2.2
Overlap Points Prediction

After the above local exploration, each correspondence obtains a pair of local patch features from
the first decoder layer. We then utilize them to predict overlap points between each patch pair for
subsequent Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance Computation. We extract overlap information from
local patches using a simple yet effective Patch Overlap Prediction (POP) module. It takes input
as the coarse-grained features containing global overlap information from coarse matching module
and the fine-grained features from the current decoder layer, aiming to integrate features across
granularity and predict fine-grained overlap between patches. It consists of two components: a
borderless EdgeConv for aggregating local features, and a cross-attention [6, 36] for interacting
cross-patch information.

Though EdgeConv [37] effectively captures local information by constructing point-wise k-NN
graphs within the patch, it restricts the search within the patch. It pushes the vicinity towards
the interior of the patch when encountering boundary points, affecting the smoothness of local
descriptions. Therefore, we have lifted this restriction, allowing the k-NN search to include points
outside the patch, and we refer to it as borderless EdgeConv. Furthermore, we strengthen each point

x is the feature
from the current decoder layer and f t
x is the nearest upsampled feature from the last transformer
block. ξθ is a nonlinear layer activated by Softplus and each decoder layer’s point features are
mapped to the same dimension, allowing for the sharing parameters of subsequent modules across
scales. Then the edge feature eij between point pair xi and xj with features f i
x and f j
x in a patch
can be calculated as e(k)
ij = hθ(cat[f i
x
(k−1), f j
x
(k−1) −f i
x
(k−1)]). Here, hθ denotes a nonlinear layer
activated by LeakyReLU, k denotes the k-th layer of EdgeConv. Finally, the point-wise feature is
calculated as f i
x = hθ(cat[f i
x
(0), f i
x
(1), f i
x
(2)]), and f i
x
(k) is max-pooled point feature from k-th layer.

Feature-based cross-attention is then used to achieve information interaction between two local
patches corresponding to a pair of node correspondences. Given the features FX and FY after
EdgeConv of two patches X and Y, the output feature of FX after cross-attention is:

f i
x =
X|Y|

where ai,j = Softmax(

f j
yWK⊤/√dt) is the attention score between FX and FY.

The co-contextual feature of FY can be calculated in the same way. Now the output features FX
and FY contain sufficient information to achieve overlap prediction. We utilize the 0-1 scaled cosine
similarity between points of two patches as the overlap score:

s = (

Overlap-ware Sinkhorn Distance

Overlap Points Filtering
Conducting a direct search for optimal transport across all points within
patches may precipitate erroneous matches, consequently inducing inaccuracies in Sinkhorn distance
computation. To mitigate this issue, we advocate limiting the computation of the Sinkhorn distance to
the most probable overlapping points. The rationale is that the selectively filtered overlapping points
exhibit a higher likelihood of successful matching, thereby mitigating the susceptibility to distance
measurement errors. Therefore, we only retain points with high overlap scores for further Sinkhorn
iteration to improve the robustness of optimal transport solver.

Figure 4: Overlap Points Filtering with
Dynamic Top-k Illustration

Specifically, we adopt a dynamic k [38, 39] strategy to select
the points with top overlap score adaptively. Intuitively, the
number of potential overlap points should vary across the
patches due to factors like geometry, overlap area, etc. Patch
with higher overlap scores should retain more overlapping
points. Therefore, we select the top-q predicted scores and
sum them up to represent the roughly estimated overlap
points number, i.e., k = max{⌊Pq
i=1 sq⌋, 1}. Then points
with top-k overlap scores are retained as overlap points.
Rows and columns devoid of overlap points are discarded,
and only the remaining entries are involved in the subsequent
Sinkhorn operation. This strategy effectively enhances the
robustness while reducing computational overhead.

Overlap-aware Marginal Prior
The initialization of the Sinkhorn algorithm typically sets the
marginal distributions, µ and ν, as uniform distributions. This initialization strategy presupposes equal
importance among points to be allocated. However, it is suboptimal and potentially unreasonable
in most cases. The importance of individual points ideally varies according to factors such as their
positions, features, etc. With the availability of estimated overlap scores between two patches, it is
prudent to incorporate this as prior during initialization. With the help of POP for estimating the
overlap score, a more informed initialization of the Sinkhorn algorithm can be achieved.

Specifically, with the overlap score denoted as s, we discard the rows and columns where without
top-k scores to yield the filtered overlap score s′. Then we apply row- and column-normalization to
s′ to adjust the marginal vectors, weighting them according to the overlap scores:

µov =

Given a pair of patches X and Y with their overlap score s,
the filtered overlap points can be computed as Xov =
n
xi
 top-k(i,j) (s)
o
and Yov is computed in

the same way. Similar to [40], we then calculate the cost matrix C = −FXov(FYov)⊤/
√

d based on
their features. Following the dustbin setting as in [40, 41] to handle unmatched pairs, we augment the
cost matrix C ∈R|Xov|×|Yov| to C ∈R(|Xov|+1)×(|Yov|+1) by appending a new row and column
with a learnable parameter z. To incorporate overlap-aware marginal prior, we append the sum of
one marginal to another to serve as the dustbin. Specifically, the unnormalized µov can be updated
as µov :=
h
µov ; P|Yov|
j=1
νov
i
, and similarly for νov. Then normalization is applied as in Eq. (5) to
ensure that the sum equals 1. The formulation of the Overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance is as follows:

where Tij the i, j-th element from the assignment matrix T ∈R(|µov|+1)×(|νov|+1) of optimal
transport problem. The above problem can be solved efficiently via the Sinkhorn Algorithm [42, 30]
on GPUs. Moreover, it is differentiable [40], enabling the back-propagation of the supervision signal
from the transport result to the Patch Overlap Prediction module.

3.2.4
Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree for Multi-scale Consistency Modeling

Though the above proposed overlap SD effectively models the similarity between patches, it solely
explores the neighborhood features at a single scale while still neglecting multi-scale information. To
gather features at various scales for characterizing informative MSC, we propose the Hierarchical
Sinkhorn Tree to traverse the feature hierarchy by repeating the above exploring and measuring steps.

Specifically, for modeling single-scale consistency, we conduct local exploration of correspondence
at the next level of the feature pyramid to form local patches and then measure their similarity using
overlap SD. Notably, besides the measurement computation, overlap SD also matches potential
overlapping points across patches. Moreover, due to the presence of dustbin strategy, these points are
further filtered. If the assignment results T generated by Sinkhorn algorithm can help select more
accurate overlap points for finer-grained local exploration, it enables a more precise characterization of
MSC. Therefore, we retain the most likely overlapping matches via mutual top-k selection (dropping
dustbin). These matches continue exploring the feature at the next level with overlap SD. Repeating
these two steps achieves the complete modeling of MSC across all scales. The whole modeling
process essentially involves a Breath First Search (BFS) traversal with pruning of a K-ary tree rooted
at the superpoint, with its k-NN in the feature pyramid serving as child nodes. HST is the subtrees
pruned by overlap SD. Modeling MSC is essentially synchronously traversing a pair of HSTs and
aggregating the overlap SD of corresponding tree nodes. We take the mean of overlap SD for each
layer and then perform a weighted sum across scales to obtain the final MSC. Following [6, 14], a
more robust probabilistic selection strategy is then adopted to form output correspondence set. The
probability for all putative matches is p = Softmax(1/τ(−m)), where m is the 0-1 normalized
MSCs and τ is the temperature parameter that controls the soft assignment.

Loss Functions

The total loss L is the sum of each layer’s loss. And each layer-wise loss L(l) is composed of the
overlap loss L(l)
o , the overlap-aware matching loss L(l)
om, and the Overlap-aware circle loss L(l)
oc , i.e.,
L(l) = L(l)

Overlap loss
To supervise the overlap prediction, we minimize the cross entropy loss between the
predicted overlap score s and the ground truth s with radius τo. Here J·K is the Iversion bracket.

Overlap matching loss
To supervise the optimal transport result of Overlap-aware Sinkhorn
Distance, we minimize the negative log-likelihood loss as in [40] on the assignment matrix T. Given
the set OV representing the overlap point pairs within the overlap radius τov as the ground truth
matching, I and J denoting the unmatched points, Lom is defined as:

Lom = −

(x,y)∈OV
log Tx,y −
X

x∈I
log Tx,m+1 −

Inspired by [34], we extend the coarse matching loss [13] to the feature
hierarchy to further supervise the overlap prediction at each layer, i.e., Loc =

registration is considered correct if the root mean square error (RMSE) is under 0.2m. We also report
the feature matching recall (FMR) and inlier ratio (IR). IR is defined as the fraction of point pairs’
distance less than 0.1m under correct transformation and FMR is the fraction of point pairs’ IR larger
than 5%. Relative Rotation Error (RRE) and Relative Translation Error (RTE) are the metrics to
measure the difference between the predicted transformation and the ground-truth transformation.

Comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods.
We compare our proposed HST to recent state-of-
the-art methods including: FCGF [32], D3Feat [4], SpinNet [5], Predator [6], CoFiNet [12], YOHO
[43], GeoTransformer (GeoTR) [13], RIGA [44], REGTR [45], OIF-PCR (OIF) [14] and RoITr [46],
see in Tab. 1. We first report the RR, FMR, and IR results using the RANSAC [17] estimator under
different numbers of sampled correspondences. Following [6, 13, 14], we run RANSAC for 50k
iterations to estimate the final transformation. Following [14], we only report individual results of
REGTR [45] not distinguishing the number of sampling points because it estimates the final pose
based on all the superpoints instead of sampling. HST outperforms all the previous descriptor-based
and end-to-end methods on both 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch. It surpasses the closest competitor by 1.1
pp and 1.7 pp respectively on RR, reflecting the superiority in actual high and low overlap alignment.
When the correspondence number varies, HST consistently maintains a significant lead over the
others on the boards. For FMR and IR, HST still shows outstanding performance. It reaches the best
or second best in most data points, indicating its stability when confronting limited correspondences.

We further compare the registration results replacing RANSAC with other estimators including
weighted SVD [49], local-to-global registration (LGR) [13], and Iterative LGR [15] in Tab. 2. In
addition to RR, we further introduce RRE (◦), RTE (m), and time (s) to evaluate the estimated error
and latency of the methods. First, when replacing with weighted SVD, all methods suffer severe
performance degradation and some even fail to align while HST still achieved the best performance
across all the metrics. When using LGR, HST consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. It improves the previous best ([13]) by 1.7% on 3DMatch [1] and 3.6%
on 3DLoMatch [6] while with the smallest RRE and RTE. The most recent advances [15] refine the
registration in an iterative update way. We adapt HST to iterative registration built upon PEAL [15]
with 3d overlap prior and utilize LGR multiple times to gradually refine the final transformation. The
results demonstrate that HST achieving competitive performance although we have not optimized
it for the multi-step pipeline, which once again proves the effectiveness of our method. The above
results demonstrate that our method performs well even without RANSAC to filter out outliers in

fine-level correspondences. It indicates that HST is capable of forming reliable and robust coarse
matching sets, which effectively assist subsequent fine matching to achieve accurate registration.

Comparisons under extreme low overlap.
We design a set of experiments targeting overlap ratios
of less than 10% and compare the performance with GeoTransformer [13] to test the robustness of
HST when facing extremely low overlap. However, the currently available preprocessed datasets,
3DMatch [1] and 3DLoMatch [6] ( > 30% and 10 - 30%, respectively), do not include samples with
such extremely low overlap (< 10%). Therefore, we access the 3DMatch raw dataset [1] and collect a
new set of point cloud pairs with overlap ratio under 10%, which we refer to as 3DExtremeLoMatch
(3DExMatch) dataset, containing a total of 1,343 samples. We first test the model pre-trained on
3DMatch directly on 3DExMatch, and the results can be found in the left part of Tab. 3.

We then randomly divide the 3DExMatch into training, validation, and test sets with proportions
of 60% (805 samples), 10% (134 samples), and 30% (404 samples), respectively. We fine-tune the
pretrained GeoTransformer [13] and HST both for 3 epochs on the training set, and then evaluate them
on the test set. The results can be found in right part of Tab. 3. Both results clearly demonstrate that
HST maintains strong performance even under low overlap conditions, confirming the effectiveness
of our method.

Comparisons to the outlier-rejection methods.
We further compare HST with other state-of-the-
art outlier-rejection methods to gain more insights into handling outliers. For fairness, we replace
HST directly with GC-RANSAC [18], MAC [22], and FastMAC [50]. Results on both 3DMatch
and 3DLoMatch can be found in the following Tab. 4. All three methods, along with HST, showed
performance improvements compared to the vanilla GeoTransformer, with HST demonstrating
the most significant enhancement. However, on 3DLoMatch, the improvements from these three
methods were less pronounced, and some even showed a potential negative impact. In contrast, HST
maintained better robustness, highlighting its superior effectiveness over previous outlier rejection
methods in scenarios with low overlap and high noise.

Metrics.
Following [6, 13], 3 metrics are
adopted to evaluate our methods: Relative Ro-
tation Error (RRE), Relative Translation Error
(RTE), and Registration Recall (RR).

Registration Results.
We compare our
method with recent state-of-the-art methods
in Tab.
5, including FCGF [32], D3Feat
[4], SpinNet [5], Predator [6], CoFiNet [12],
GeoTR [13], OIF [14], and PEAL [15]. Our
method outperforms all the baselines for all
metrics. It indicates that HST is effective in
handling both indoor and outdoor scenes.

4.3
Ablation Study

Importance of individual modules.
Tab. 6 shows the results of the ablation studies of each
component on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch. We first replace our proposed overlap-aware Sinkhorn
Distance with vanilla Sinkhorn Distance, i.e., removing overlap filtering and overlap-aware initializa-
tion. Results indicate that all the metrics decrease significantly, proving that HST benefits from our
designed scheme. Then we ablate these two components and the POP module individually. Removing
either will cause severe performance degradation, indicating each component is beneficial for patch
difference measurement. Finally, we ablate the depth of HST, i.e., the number of scales used. The
results show that performance degrades as the depth reduces, with optimal performance achieved
when all scales are explored. This confirms that robust coarse matching relies on accurate MSC.

Figure 5: Details of robustness study.

Robustness study
Fig.
5 shows the results of
adding zero-mean Gaussian noise with a standard
deviation of 0.01 to 3DLoMatch [6] dataset, and grad-
ually increasing the proportion of noise points to test
the robustness of the model. It demonstrates that HST
maintains the most stable performance compared to
[13, 12], indicating its superior noise resistance.

Conclusion

In the paper, we present a simple but effective Hierar-
chical Sinkhorn Tree (HST) to model the multiscale
geometric consistency for robust point cloud registration. We hierarchically explore the neighbor-
hoods of each correspondence in their feature pyramids, and devise a novel overlap-aware Sinkhorn
Distance to compute the vicinity similarity. Subsequently, the most likely overlapping points are
retained to continue local exploration. The modeling process essentially involves a BFS traversal of a
k-ary tree rooted at the coarse-level point. Pruning is performed during traversal using the overlap-
aware Sinkhorn distance to obtain subtrees, which is the so-called HST. Extensive experiments show
HST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

In this supplemental material, we first provide detailed introductions about our utilized datasets in
Sec. A.1. Metrics utilized for evaluation in our experiments are demonstrated in Sec. A.2. Detailed
loss and further particulars are provided in Sec. A.3. We further provide more implementation details
in Sec. A.4. More results are provided in Sec. A.5. Limitations and broader impact are discussed in
Sec. A.6 and Sec. A.7. Finally, we demonstrate more qualitative results of registration on 3DMatch,

Datasets

3DMatch & 3DLoMatch
3DMatch [1] contains 62 scenes collected from SUN3D [2], 7-Scenes
[3], RGBD Scenes v.2 [4], Analysis-by-Synthesis [5], BundleFusion [6], and Halbel et al. [7] among
which 46 scenes are used for training, 8 scenes for validation and 8 scenes for testing. Scenes are
captured from various indoor environments with sensors like Microsoft Kinect. The licenses for each
component are listed as follows in Tab. 7. Following [8, 9, 10], we use the training data preprocessed
by [8] and evaluate on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch benchmarks. The original 3DMatch only contains
point clouds with overlap > 30%. 3DLoMatch additionally includes a subset of point cloud pairs with
an overlap ratio between 10% and 30%, specifically designed to evaluate performance in low overlap
scenarios.

KITTI Odometry
KITTI [11] is a vision benchmark especially focusing on outdoor scenes. It
consists of 11 sequences of outdoor driving scenarios scanned by a Velodyne HDL-64 3D laser
scanner. We follow [12, 13, 8] and adopt 0-5 for training, 6-7 for validation and 8-10 for testing.
The ground truth transformations are refined utilizing ICP following [12, 13, 8] due to the noisy
GPS data. we only use point cloud pairs that are at least 10m away for evaluation, i.e., 1358
pairs for training, 180 for validation, and 555 for testing following [12]. It is published under the

Evaluation Metrics

Relative Rotation Error
Relative Rotation Error (RRE) is the geodesic distance in degrees between
estimated and ground-truth rotation matrices. It is calculated by measuring the difference between
the estimated and true rotation vectors as follows:

RRE = arccos

 
trace
 
RT · R −1


2

!

.
(10)

Relative Translation Error
Relative Translation Error (RTE) is the Euclidean distance between
estimated and ground-truth translation vectors. It is calculated by measuring the difference between
the estimated and true translation matrices as follows:

RTE = ∥t −t∥2.
(11)

Registration Recall
Registration Recall (RR) is the fraction of correctly registered point cloud pairs.
In the 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch benchmarks, two fragments are considered registered correctly if

16

where T is the predicted transformation and C∗are the ground truth correspondences. J·K is the
Iversion bracket. Moreover, we align with the evaluation protocol in 3DMatch [1], the immediately
adjacent point clouds are excluded due to their high overlap ratio.

JRREi < 5◦∧RTEi < 2mK.
(14)

Inlier Ratio
Inlier Ratio (IR) is the fraction of inlier correspondences among all the putative
correspondences. A correspondence is considered an inlier when the distance between two points is
smaller than τ1 = 10 cm under the ground-truth transformation T:

IR = 1

where C is the putative correspondence set.

Feature Matching Recall
Feature Matching Recall (FMR) is the fraction of point cloud pairs
whose IR is larger than a certain threshold τ2 = 0.05. It measures the likelihood that the optimal
transformation between two point clouds can be recovered using robust estimators. It is calculated as:

FMR = 1

i=1
JIRi > τ2K.

Detailed Loss

Overlap-aware circle loss
Each layer-wise overlap-aware circle loss [10] is calculated as the
mean of losses on point cloud pairs X and Y from the l-th layer of feature pyramid, i.e., Loc(l) =
 
LX
oc
(l) + LY
oc
(l)
/2. The anchor patch set A is collected as the patches in X have at least one
positive patch in Y. The positive patch set εi
p is defined as the patches that share at least 10% overlap.
The negative patch setεi
n is the patches share no overlap. Then the individual loss for X is defined as:

LX
oc

(17)

where dj

and βi,k


. The hyper-parameters for margin are set to ∆p = 0.1 and ∆n = 1.4
following [10]. The loss LY
oc
(l) for Y are calculated in the same way.

Inspired by [14] introducing segmentation loss to multiple feature scales to enhance the feature
representation, we extend the coarse (superpoint) matching loss to the feature hierarchy to further

17


---Page Break---
supervise the overlap prediction at each layer. The overall overlap-ware circle loss is calculated
as Loc = PL
l=0 wl Loc(l), where wl is the weight for the l-th layer. For stable training and better
performance, we decay the weight by half with each successive layer, i.e., Loc = PL
l=0 ( 1

2)lLoc(l).

A.4
Implementation Details

Our proposed method is implemented and evaluated in Pytorch [15] and we train it on a single
RTX 3090 GPU with an AMD EPYC 9654 CPU. Specifically, the network is trained with Adam
optimizer [16] for 40 epochs on 3DMatch and 80 epochs on KITTI with batch size of 1 and weight
decay of 10−6. The learning rate initializes from 10−4 and decays exponentially by 0.05 every
epoch on 3DMatch and every 4 epochs on KITTI, respectively. The matching radius τ is set as 5cm
for indoor 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and 60cm for outdoor KITTI to generate overlapping matches.
We randomly sample 128 pairs of ground-truth coarse matches during training. The overall Multi-
scale Consistency (MSC) is calculated as the weighted sum of each layer’s mean overlap-aware
Sinkhorn distance (overlap SD) S(l) and the weights also decay by half as the layer increases, i.e.,
MSC = PL
l=1( 1

2)lS(l). The k that controls the vicinity size for k-NN exploration is set as 16. We
run the Sinkhorn Algorithm [17] for 100 iterations to calculate the overlap-aware Sinkhorn distance
and solve the optimal transport for fine matching.

Coarse Matching
The coarse matching is achieved by calculating the Gaussian correlation matrix
[10] as the matching score S. Given the features Fx and Fy from the last Geometric Transformer
block [10], the matching score is calculated as:

Sij = exp(−∥Fxi −Fyj∥2
2).
(18)

Then a dual-softmax normalization operator [18, 19, 10] is utilized on S to reduce ambiguous matches
while converting it to the probability P of mutual matching [19]:

Pij = softmax(S(i, ·))j · softmax(S(·, j))i.
(19)

Finally, we select the top-k largest entries as the coarse correspondence set:

˜C = {(xi, yj) | (i, j) ∈top-ki,j(Pij)}.
(20)

Fine Matching
At fine level matching, each correspondence is refined to point level for establishing
finer correspondences. For each coarse correspondence xi and yj, we adopt the point-to-node
grouping [9, 10] to extract the local patches Xi and Yj from the dense point layer. We then compute
the feature similarity matrix s with their corresponding features FXi and FYj of two patches:

s = FXi(FYj)T /
√

d,
(21)

where d is the feature dimension.

Then the feature similarity matrix is augmented by a learnable row and column entry that serves as the
dustbin as in [20, 9, 10]. The fine matching is considered an optimal transport problem solving by the
Sinkhorn Algorithm [21]. We then apply 100 iterations of row- and column-normalization (Sinkhorn
Algorithm) to compute the final assigned matching score s by discarding the dustbin entries. The
output point-level correspondences from patches Xi and Yj are then obtained by selecting the mutual
top-k entries of the score s:

C = {(xi, yj) | (i, j) ∈mutual top-ki,j(sij)}.
(22)

Additional Experimental Results

A.5.1
Scene-wise Results

We present the scene-wise Registration Recall (RR) results in Tab. 8 and Tab. 9. The results on
3DMatch [1] demonstrate our method outperforms baselines in most of the scenes. On the hard case

18


---Page Break---
like Home_2, our method improves the previous best by 3.2 pp, indicating its better registration
accuracy. While on 3DLoMatch [8], our method surpasses the strongest baseline [10] in almost all
scenarios and has achieved nearly all of the best performances. This indicates that our HST shows
even greater performance improvement in low-overlap scenarios compared to high-overlap scenarios,
proving its superior robustness in handling severe conditions.

Additional Ablation Studies

In this subsection, we provide more ablation studies on the type of Local Exploration, and the type of
Patch Feature Transformation. Here, we provide only the Registration Recall results for comparison,
as our primary focus is the actual effectiveness of point cloud registration. In many cases, the
distribution, location, and number of correspondences can greatly affect the Inlier Ratio (IR) and
Feature Matching Recall (FMR) metrics. It is common for the IR and FMR to decrease significantly
even with better registration results (higher RR), which can impact the ablative analysis of each
component. The similar observations have also been made by [8], [9], and [23].

The type of Local Exploration.
We evaluate two different types of local exploration for extracting
local patches: the Point-to-node (P2N in the table) grouping [26, 9], and the k-NN grouping we

19


---Page Break---
use. Point-to-node grouping constructs local patches by associating each point with its nearest node
(superpoint). It can be easily extended to hierarchical local exploration by replacing nodes with lower
spatial resolution point clouds from adjacent layers. The results in Tab. 10 show that the Point-to-node
grouping strategy has a slightly lower performance than k-NN grouping. In fact, there is not much
difference in performance between the two grouping methods. Our experience believe that the two
patches extracted by k- NN from same source point cloud pair may have closer distributions, which
is beneficial for subsequent overlap prediction. Therefore, we choose k- NN for local exploration.

The type of Patch Feature Transformation.
We then provide an ablation study on the patch feature
transformation method. We compare the results between the vanilla EdgeConv [24], self-attention
[25], and our expanded version of EdgeConv (borderless EdgeConv) in Tab. 10. Registration results
show EdgeConv-based methods perform better than self-attention. Due to the introduction of points
outside the patch to smooth the feature description and the construction of k-NN graph, the borderless
one has a slight performance improvement compared to vanilla EdgeConv on 3DLoMatch.

A.6
Limitations.

The limitations of our proposed HST are 2-fold: 1) HST still involves evaluating and selecting
generated coarse correspondences. In some extreme low-overlap or noisy cases, when the quality of
putative correspondences searched by the coarse stage model is poor, it can still negatively impact
registration and lead to failure. A feasible solution is to subsequently integrate HST into the coarse
correspondence generation process to produce a more accurate match set directly. 2) Assessing patch
similarity purely from a geometric perspective is limited due to noise, locality, etc. If more priors
or features, such as color, normal maps, and semantic labels, could be introduced subsequently to
characterize neighborhood features, it would enable a more accurate coarse correspondence searching.
We think it is a promising topic for further improving the robustness of registration.

A.7
Broader Impact.

We study the problem of retrieving accurate correspondence through multi-scale consistency (MSC)
for robust point cloud registration and present a novel method to model the MSC called HST. HST
makes a first attempt towards injecting a coarse correspondence filter into the coarse-to-fine pipeline,
allowing for more accurate and robust point cloud registration. It contributes to various applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. For example, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) tasks can benefit from our method by enabling more robust unified scene reconstruction.
Also, our method can help more precise scene understanding in autonomous driving as it is capable of
forming a reliable correspondence set for aligning point cloud scans at different timestamps. However
potential negative impacts may occur as it is the fundamental of various computer vision tasks. For
example, our method may fail in some severe environments like no overlapping area leading to wrong
scene representations.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the Abstract and Introduction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the supplemental material Sec. A.6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

24


---Page Break---
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see the Method section and the supplemental material Sec. A.4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open Access to Data and Code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the supplemental material Sec. A.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the Method section and the supplemental material Sec. A.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Given that the baseline methods we compared do not report error bars, we
align our evaluation with theirs to ensure fair comparisons.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

26


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the supplemental material A.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see the supplemental material Sec. A.7.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

27


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for Existing Assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use open-source indoor benchmarks 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch as well as
the outdoor KITTI Odometry benchmark. Licenses please refer to the supplemental material
Sec. A.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

28


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: It will be included in the camera-ready version.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
