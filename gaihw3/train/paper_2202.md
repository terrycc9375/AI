Abstract

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive ca-
pabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, a generalist MLLM
typically underperforms compared with a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks,
which can be attributed to task interference. In this paper, we propose a mixture of
multimodal experts (MoME) to mitigate task interference and obtain a generalist
MLLM. Our MoME is composed of two key components, a mixture of vision
experts (MoVE) and a mixture of language experts (MoLE). MoVE can adaptively
modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders, and has a strong
compatibility in transformation architecture. MoLE incorporates sparsely gated
experts into LLMs to achieve painless improvements with roughly unchanged
inference costs. In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both
vision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive experiments
show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist MLLMs
across various VL tasks.

Introduction

Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [39, 35, 48, 31, 67] have witnessed re-
markable progress. With the help of Large Language Models (LLMs) [13, 63, 1] and Modality
Encoders [50, 30, 17, 52, 70], MLLMs demonstrate excellent multimodal comprehensive abilities,
especially in solving a wide range of vision-language (VL) tasks [3, 42, 37, 55, 57, 56], such as Image
Cpation, Visual Question Answering, Referring Expression Comprehension, and Optical Character
Recognition. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that a generalist MLLM tends to have lower
performance compared to a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks [12, 8], as depicted in Fig. 1 (a).
This phenomenon can be attributed to task interference, a fundamental and crucial issue in multi-task
learning [16, 41, 64].

There are some preliminary attempts [15, 6, 12, 5, 8, 58] to address this issue in instruction-tuning
MLLMs. The most promising direction [12, 5, 8, 58] among these attempts is to use a mixture of
experts (MoE) in MLLMs, aiming for each expert to specialize in several tasks. However, these
works only investigate MoE in LLMs and primarily concentrate on textual differences between
tasks, overlooking the equally important visual information. As shown in Fig. 1 (b-c), we analyze
the distribution of various VL tasks across both vision and language modalities. It is evident that
images from different groups of VL tasks exhibit distinct feature distributions, as do texts. Inspired
by this observation, we argue that handling task interference needs to comprehensively exploit task
differences in both vision and language modalities.

Figure 1: VL data distribution visualization and model performance comparisons. Experimental
results in (a) show that a generalist model trained on a mixed dataset underperforms most specialist
models trained on separate task groups. The feature distributions visualized in (b) and (c) show
significant discrepancies across VL tasks in both images and instructions.

To mitigate task interference, we devise a Mixture of Multimodal Experts (MoME) and integrate it
into MLLMs. Our MoME consists of a Mixture of Vision Experts (MoVE) for adaptively aggregating
features from various vision encoders [52, 17, 50], and a Mixture of Language Experts (MoLE) for
leveraging multiple sparsely-activated parameter-efficient adapters. To avoid feature mismatch in
different vision encoders, we propose an adaptive deformable transformation (ADT) module in MoVE
and use it to transfer features of vision encoders into a unified-length sequence of feature vectors. Our
ADT module combines adaptive average pooling and deformable attention [71] to obtain compressed
and self-enhanced visual features. After feature transformation, our MoVE uses an instance-level
soft router to modulate and aggregate transformed visual features according to the instructions. Our
MoLE introduces several parameter-efficient adapters [9] as experts and integrates them by using an
instance-level sparsely-activated router. Due to the utilization of adapters, MoLE can be integrated
into each feed-forward network layer of an LLM and only incurs a few computational costs with
consistent performance gains.

To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal understanding ability of MoME, we collect an amount of
VL tasks to form an instruction-tuning dataset and split them into four groups. Extensive experiments
show that both MoVE and MoLE can consistently improve performance across all groups of tasks.
Notably, MoVE can achieve an average performance gain of 12.87 points across all VL tasks, and
improve by over 20 points on the "Document" group. Furthermore, we visualize the expert load
distributions of MoVE and MoLE across various tasks. The experts in both MoVE and MoLE exhibit
a relatively clear specialization in different groups of VL tasks. For example, the "Document" group
of tasks has a strong preference for the "Pix2Struct" vision expert. The expert specialization is strong
evidence to demonstrate that our MoME dynamically selects experts to adapt to task differences and
mitigate task interference.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose MoME by simultaneously designing mixtures of experts tailored for both the vision
encoder and the LLM, resulting in generalist MLLMs with the ability to combat task interference.
• Through statistical analysis, we demonstrate that our MoME specializes in both vision and language
modality, effectively adapting to the varying requirements of different VL tasks.
• Extensive experiments show that our MoME possesses excellent multimodal understanding abilities
and achieves superior performances across various groups of VL tasks.

2.1
Vision Encoders in MLLMs

Vision encoders play important roles in the perception ability of recent MLLMs by encoding visual
information into visual tokens, enabling LLMs to understand information on visual modalities. Most
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) use CLIP-ViT [52] as their vision encoder to provide
the basic image-level perception of an image for LLMs, which is useful for tasks such as image
caption and general VQA. However, Tong et al. [62] have found that CLIP-ViT struggles to encode
some visual patterns, severely limiting perception and preventing MLLMs from becoming generalist.

2


---Page Break---
To alleviate this, recent works [33, 62, 27] integrated different vision encoders [52, 17, 50, 70, 29]
into a single MLLM, which enhanced the perception of MLLM. However, none have effectively
mitigated the interference among different visual features, resulting in sub-optimal utilization of each
encoder. Differently, we explore the task differences and propose MoVE to perform self-enhanced
transformation and adaptive routing among features from different encoders, achieving consistently
high performances across vast VL tasks.

2.2
Mixture of Experts in Large Models

Mixture of Experts (MoE) [24] is a type of structure with multiple expert networks working together,
where each expert is responsible for a part of the knowledge space. By only activating specific experts
adaptively during inference, MoE can reduce resource consumption and enhance reasoning speed,
which is useful for LLM. Existing MoE LLM [18, 26, 14] usually replace the feed-forward network
(FFN) with the MoE layer. Each MoE layer consists of a router and multiple expert networks and
each token is assigned to several expert networks by the router. MoE LLMs tend to outperform dense
models with the same inference activate parameters.

In addition to its effectiveness in foundation models, some works [12, 8, 58, 20, 32] have utilized
MoE in the visual instruction tuning [36] phrase of MLLMs to mitigate task interference, aiming for
each expert to specialize in several tasks. Some of them replicate the original FFN in LLMs, while
others insert multiple low-rank adaptation [22] modules in parallel with the original FFN, converting
LLM into multi-expert architecture. However, they primarily concentrate on LLM but overlook task
interference within the visual perceiving process of MLLMs. In contrast, we comprehensively exploit
task interference in both vision and language modalities and propose MoME to mitigate them with
specialized vision and language experts.

Methods

To design a generalist MLLM with powerful multimodal understanding capabilities, we begin by
analyzing task interference, a common challenge in current MLLMs (Section 3.1). Then, we propose
our Mixture of Multimodal Experts and introduce its main components in Section 3.2.

3.1
Analysis of Task Interference

Task interference is a fundamental and crucial issue in multi-task learning. As current generalist
MLLMs are trained with a number of tasks, they naturally suffer from this issue especially when the
number of tasks increases. To investigate this issue in a scenario of MLLMs, we will analyze the
feature distribution and the performance change of MLLMs on a tailored instruction-tuning dataset.

To demonstrate the external manifestations of task interference, we first construct a mixed instruction-
tuning dataset with various VL tasks and split all tasks into four groups. The performance comparisons
between MLLMs trained on the mixed dataset and each task group are illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). It is
shown that a generalist model trained on the mixed dataset underperforms specialist models on three
task groups. We conclude that the generalist model suffers from a notable task interference problem.

In the era of Large models, there are some attempts to handle task interference from various perspec-
tives, such as instruction, architecture, and dataset configuration. Here, we focus on the mainstream
direction, architecture design, and try to explore a robust architecture to combat task interference.
In terms of architecture, most existing works prefer a mixture of experts in LLMs. The experts can
be feed-forward networks or parameter-efficient modules. However, we argue that this paradigm of
architectural design is sub-optimal as visual and textual information should be given equal importance.

In Fig. 1 (b-c), we investigate the feature distribution of various task groups on vision and language
modalities, respectively. All samples of each task group are fed into vision and text encoders to
produce modality features. These features are transformed by using PCA and then visualized to show
the distribution. We observe that the feature distributions of different task groups exhibit significant
differences in both the vision and language modalities. As mentioned above, the textual differences
can be addressed by multiple experts in LLMs, but visual differences lack effective handling. In
the following section, we will introduce our Mixture of Multimodal Experts, which simultaneously
handles visual and textural differences between tasks to mitigate task interference.

3.2
Architecture

As illustrated in Figure 2, we present our novel MoME architecture that dynamically mixes vision
and language experts. The proposed architecture aims to adaptively aggregate visual information
(3.2.1) and select LLM pathways (3.2.2) based on the given instructions.

3.2.1
Mixture of Vision Experts

Figure 3: Comparison of MLLMs
with different vision encoders.

Before introducing our MoVE architecture, we will present a
pilot study that inspires us to design MoVE. Specifically, we
design three MLLMs (consists of vision encoder, projection,
and LLM), which share the same architecture except vision en-
coders. These three MLLMs use three distinct vision encoders,
CLIP, DINOv2, Pix2Struct, respectively. After training them
using the same data and strategies, we found that MLLMs with
different vision encoders excelled in specific tasks, as presented
in Fig. 3. the MLLM with CLIP-ViT is good at general tasks
and regional caption tasks. the MLLM with DINOv2 excels
in REC, a visual grounding task. the MLLM with Pix2Struct
is outstanding in text-intensive document understanding tasks.
However, each model had weaknesses and none could achieve
uniformly excellent performance across all tasks.

Inspired by the above study, we propose MoVE to combine various off-the-shell vision encoders and
effectively align and aggregate their visual features. The key components in MoVE are an adaptive
deformable transformation module and an instruction-based soft router. The former aims to align the
features from various vision encoders, and the latter seeks to modulate and aggregate transformed
features based on the instructions.

Adaptive Deformable Transformation.
Given the diversity in architecture and training methods
of different vision encoders, the issue of mismatched visual representations in terms of sequence
length and feature space becomes significant. While current researches [62, 27, 33] often focus
on models like CLIP-ViT [52] and DINO [50], which share similar data processing pipeline, the
mismatch problems are less important and frequently overlooked. However, the aspect ratios of
Pix2Struct [30] feature shapes vary depending on the input image. Simply combining them through
padding and addition will lead to the misalignment among visual tokens and the damage of visual
information. To tackle this challenge, we innovatively design an adaptive deformable transformation
(ADT) module that effectively transforms features from diverse vision encoders f into a unified-length
feature sequence ˆf, ensuring more coherent and informative visual representations for subsequent
aggregations.

As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), the ADT module consists of a 2D adaptive pooling layer and M deformable
attention layers (D). It attempts to automatically select the corresponding information from original
features f to refine the coarse features obtained by 2D adaptive pooling D(f),

ˆf = DM(D(f), f)
(1)

Inspired by Deformable DERT [71], we choose deformable cross-attention for its 2D sampling
mechanism, which is ideal for interactions among visual feature maps of varying shapes. Meanwhile,
it converges fast and has computational and memory efficiency. Specifically, each deformable layer
consists of a self-attention layer, a deformable cross-attention, and a feed-forward layer. The crucial
select operation occurs in the deformable cross-attention layer, which takes the output of the upper
self-attention as query q ∈RL×C, samples the original feature map f ∈RH×W ×C, and outputs
result O ∈RL×C. In this module, the first step is to generate attention weights w ∈RL×Nh×Np and
L sets of 2D sampling points, denoted as p, from the input queries q. For each set, there are Nh × Np
points, where Nh signifies the number of attention heads and Np represents the number of points
sampled by each head. The sample points and attention weights generation process is as follows,

pijk = (Pp(qi)jk + Ri), i ∈{1, . . . , L}, j ∈{1, . . . , Nh}, k ∈{1, . . . , Np}
(2)
w = Pw(q)
(3)

where P denotes the linear projector and R ∈RL×2 is a learnable vector called reference point. Then,
the corresponding information is sampled by attention heads from the value feature maps P(f)j
projected and split on the last dimension for each head. The sampling mechanism of each attention
head is as follows,

oij =

Np
X

k=1
wijk · Sample(Pv(f)j, pijk), i ∈{1, . . . , L}, j ∈{1, . . . , Nh}
(4)

The results of multiple attention heads are concatenated and projected to obtain the output feature O,
which is the input of subsequent feed-forward layer.

O = Po(o)
(5)

Instance-level Soft Router.
Since images from different groups of VL tasks exhibit distinct feature
distributions, there is no one-fits-all strategy to aggregate them. To address this, we propose to
generate a customized fusion ratio for each sample based on its instruction.

Specifically, we devise an instance-level soft router Gs, as depicted in Fig 2 (b). The router generates
corresponding ratios for the visual representations from different vision encoders, followed by a
weighted sum of these visual representation features ˆf, which can be formulated as,

Gs(I) =SoftMax(W2(σ(W1I + b1)) + b2)
(6)

F =

N
X

i=1
Gs(I)i × ˆfi
(7)

where N is the number of vision experts and σ denotes GeLU [21]. The router is a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) followed by a SoftMax layer to ensure that the sum of the weights equals 1. The
instruction is first passed through Sentence-BERT [53] to extract sentence embedding I, which is
then fed into the router.

3.2.2
Mixture of Language Experts

We introduce MoE architecture in LLM, aiming for each expert to specialize in several tasks.
However, conventional MoE methods typically incorporate multiple parallel FFN layers in one block,
significantly increasing training costs and memory consumption. To meet the multi-task learning
needs in the instruction tuning stage, we incorporate several parameter-efficient adapters [9] parallel
to FFN. Each adapter enhances the original FFN with task-specific understanding capabilities, thus
effectively enhancing the multitasking abilities with a few computation costs.

We insert an MoE block parallel to each FFN layer in LLM. As depicted in Fig. 2 (c), The MoE
block consists of several low-rank adapters and an instance-level sparsely-activated router Gh. The
adapter is designed as a bottleneck structure for computational efficiency, featuring a down-projection
layer Pdown, a ReLU layer σ, and an up-projection layer Pup. Moreover, a learnable scalar s is
multiplied in the output to weigh the importance adaptively. The whole low-rank adaptation process
is as follows,
y = s · Pup(σ(Pdown(x)))
(8)

The router is an MLP network followed by a top-1 gate function to ensure the output is a one-hot
vector G(I) ∈{0, 1}K. The router generates the selection based on the sentence embeddings I used
in MoVE. Each sample is routed to the corresponding adapter to calculate the adapted value o, which
can be further added to the output of the original FFN. The whole process of the MoLE block is as
follows,

o =

where K denotes the number of experts.

Experimental Results and Analysis

We collect 24 datasets and categorize them into four groups for instruction-tuning and evaluation, the
details of which can be found in Appendix B.

4.1
Analysis on MoVE

We conduct experiments on MLLMs with different vision encoders under the same training strategy
to verify the effectiveness of the two key components in MoVE: ADT and router. Experimental
results are summarized in Table 1. We take the multitasking performances of MLLMs with a single
vision encoder as our baselines. The adaptive average pooling is applied to the visual representation
from DINO and Pix2Struct, ensuring that the lengths of visual tokens fed into LLM are consistent.
Experiments #1-3 show that MLLMs using CLIP, DINO, and Pix2Struct as vision encoders exhibit
distinct strengths in General, REC, and Document tasks, respectively. Moreover, in the REG task,
which requires both captioning and visual grounding abilities, the performance of MLLMs with CLIP
and DINO significantly surpasses that of those using Pix2Struct. We can conclude that a single vision
encoder cannot meet the visual perception needs of all tasks.

Figure 4: Distribution of vision experts routing results. In each bar, the lengths of different colors
represent the frequency with which each expert is selected.

To make different vision encoders work together in perception, we first aggregate different visual
representations by addition (#4). The average performance does improve compared with models
with single vision encoders (#1-3). However, such a straightforward method does not bring much
improvement, and even some sub-items have declined. This is due to the mismatch and interference
among different visual features, which severely compromise their respective visual information. To
make visual features aligned well and reduce information loss, we first replace the pooling with the
proposed ADT network. As demonstrated in Experiment #5, ADT consistently enhances performance
across four task groups, yielding an average improvement of 4 points. Based on the transformed
visual features, we further replace the naive addition mixture process with the router to modulate and
aggregate them adaptively according to instructions (#6). This achieves an impressive performance
that significantly outperforms the addition method and the methods with a single vision encoder across
all sub-tasks. Additional experiments on the deformable mechanism can be found in Appendix C.
These experimental results prove that ADT and router are crucial and effective components of MoVE
to mitigate interference and optimally utilize the capabilities of each visual expert.

Visualization of Routing Results.
To provide a deeper understanding of the MoVE’s adaptive
routing process, we visualize the routing outcomes across various tasks. Since the feature scale
varies across different vision encoders, we cannot directly consider the output of the router as expert
importance. Instead, we integrate the output features from vision encoders, taking the magnitude of
the weighted feature vector as the importance metric. Because the final aggregated result will lean
towards the side with the larger magnitude.

As displayed in Fig. 4, for tasks that involve text recognition and graph understanding, such as
ChartQA and DocVQA, the features from the Pix2Struct encoder are dominant. In contrast, the
model utilizes more CLIP features in image-level VQA tasks like COCOCapion [11], NoCaps [2],
and Flickr30K [69]. Notably, for TextCaps [59], a task that requires two kinds of visual information,
the router shows a preference for balancing the CLIP and Pix2Struct branches. For tasks that focus
on visual grounding ability like REC [42], and REG [37], the model uses more DINO features to
perceive region-level visual information. These observations indicate that MoVE can adaptively
modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders.

4.2
Analysis on MoLE

We conduct ablation experiments to explore the best practice of MoLE, which are summarized
in Table 2. We take the model with a single adapter in each FFN (#1) as baseline, which suffers
severe task interference. Then, we replace the plain adapter with MoLE. As summarized in Table 2
#2-4, we test three kinds of MoLE routers with different inputs: token hidden states (MoLE-T),
sentence embedding (MoLE-I), and a mixture of both (MoLE-IT). The token hidden states and
sentence embedding are concatenated on the last dimension as the input for the MoLE-IT router.
The experimental results indicate that all MoLE variations outperform the plain adapter, with the
sentence-embedding-based router achieving the highest average performance.

We also explore two strategies for expert load balance in MoLE, which are tabulated in Table 2 #5-6.
MoLE-I+GS introduces variability to the router by adding Gumbel-distributed noise to the logits [25],
aiming to prevent certain experts from never being selected. MoLE-I+LB uses auxiliary loss [18] to

perform worse than the plain MoLE-I configuration.

Through comprehensive comparative experiments, we choose MoLE-I as the default configuration for
MoME. By training based on the MoVE model, MoME further enhances the multitasking capability
of MLLM, as shown in Experiments #7 and #8.

Visualization of routing results.
To provide a deeper understanding of our MoLE module, we
sample several instances from each dataset and calculate their average routing outcomes. In Fig. 5,
we present the expert load conditions of four selected datasets, each representing a kind of VL task.
At the beginning, the router assigns equal probabilities to each expert as it is randomly initialized.
However, after training, the routing distributions of MoE blocks vary significantly across tasks, as
shown in Fig. 5. This means the language experts in our MoLE module gradually specialize in distinct
task domains during training. In the inference process, the router adaptively chooses the optimal
expert to achieve strong multitasking capabilities. Meanwhile, we can observe strong resemblances
in the expert routing results of similar tasks, which are further analyzed in Appendix D.

Comparison with state-of-the-art MLLMs

We summarize the evaluation results of MoME and other MLLMs with similar resource consumption
on popular VL tasks in Table 3. The results show that our MoME method achieves promising
outcomes on most datasets compared with other generalist and MoE MLLMs, especially on TextCaps,
Flicker30K, and IconQA.

Qualitative Analisys

We present several visualized examples of our MoME model from distinct dataset groups along with
their MoVE and MoLE routing results in Fig. 6. In the REC case, DINOv2 accounts for nearly 50%
among vision experts, providing fine-grained visual information. So the model can recognize the blue

Answer

A man in a hoodie
and a child in a green
jacket are standing on
a sidewalk in the rain.

Figure 6: Visualization of samples along with their routing result distributions. The MoVE
distributions on the left represent Pix2Struct, DINOv2, and CLIP-ViT from top to bottom. MoLE is
on the bottom, with different colors indicating different experts.

car in the background and provide its precise bounding box. The Pix2Struct branch accounts for over
70% in the Document case for structured text understanding. The REG case utilizes information from
both the CLIP-ViT and DINOv2 to locate objects and generate captions. In contrast, the conventional
caption task in the General group only requires an image-level perception, so the CLIP-ViT is
dominant. Remarkably, we can observe significant differences among the MoLE routing results.
These examples show how MoME selects vision and language experts to adapt to various tasks.

Conclusion

This work investigates task interference when training a generalist MLLM across various VL tasks.
To mitigate it, we propose MoME, which specializes in both vision and language modality to adapt
to task differences. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of MoME as a generalist MLLM.

However, due to the limitations of computing resources, We have not yet expanded our approach to
more data and more modalities for experiments. Nonetheless, we believe that the proposed MoME is
versatile and can be applied to constructing generalist models in a wider range of multimodal domains.
We hope MoME will inspire new research in general-purpose multimodal AI and its applications.

Implementation Details

A.1
Architecture Details

The MoME includes three off-the-shelf vision encoders: CLIP-ViT, DINOv2, and Pix2Struct. For
CLIP-VIT, we use ViT-G/14 from EVA [17] without the last layer. The DINOv2 [50] is the official pre-
trained version of ViT-L/14 without registers. For Pix2Struct, we use the vision branch of pre-trained
Pix2Struct-base model [30]. The ADT consists of a 2D adaptive average pooling layer and a six-layer
deformable attention network. The hidden size of ADT is the same as its corresponding vision
encoder. We use 8 attention heads and each head samples 4 points in the deformable cross-attention
process. In MoLE, the hidden dimension of each adapter is set to 64. We use Vicuna-v1.5(7B) [13]
as our pre-trained LLM.

A.2
Training Details

Our training process comprises two stages. In stage 1, we train the model with MoVE and a single
adapter in LLM for 30k steps with a batch size of 64. The learning rate is warmed up linearly from 0
to 5e-4 across 1000 steps and then reduces to a minimum of 0 using cosine decay. The AdamW [38]
optimizer is employed with β1 = 0.9, β2= 0.999, and a weight decay of 0.05. In stage 2, we load
the checkpoint of stage 1 and replicate the weights of adapters to initialize MoLE, while keeping
everything else unchanged.

We use a single node with A800 80GB × 8 for all experiments, the entire training is done in one day
including stage 1 and stage 2.

B
Details of Multitasking Benchmark

We collected 24 datasets and categorized them into four groups for instruction-tuning and evaluation,
as shown in Fig. 7. For most vision-language (VL) tasks, we used the datasets in both the training and
evaluation phases. However, we only use NoCaps for evaluation because it only has an evaluation
set, and we exclude the VSR training data due to its simplicity. During the training process, we
mix the datasets within the same group into one large dataset, so the probability of each sub-dataset
being sampled equals their size as a proportion of the total. However, we ensure the sample ratio of
each group dataset is the same. For evaluation, we compute the overall score for each category by
averaging its subitem evaluation results. We follow InstructBLIP [15], Shikra [7], and UReader [66]
for our evaluation metrics, which are tabulated in Table 5. Notably, the model only takes images as
visual information without introducing OCR tokens like InstructBLIP.

C
Additional Ablation Experiments

To evaluate the effectiveness of the deformable mechanism of ADT, we conduct an ablation ex-
periment by replacing the deformable cross-attention in MoME with standard cross-attention. As
shown in Table 4, the model without deformable mechanism (#1) presents much worse performances
than the original MoME (#2) consistently. We attribute this decline to the strong inductive bias of
deformable attention in processing 2D feature maps.

D
Additional Visualization and Analysis

We present the routing distributions across different datasets of all MoLE routers in Fig. 8. In general,
the routing results differ significantly among different task groups, while the routing preferences
are similar within the same task group. From the perspective of router preferences, the datasets can
be classified as text-rich (ChartQA - TextCaps), caption (COCOCap - Flickr30K), VQA (IconQA -
GQA), REC, and REG. It can prove that the MoLE captures the modularity of the tasks and mitigates
task interferences through differential expert routing.

E
Societal Impacts

MoME utilizes pre-trained large language models (LLMs), which inherently carry limitations from
LLMs. These limitations include the potential for generating inaccurate information or biased outputs.
To address these issues, we enhance the model’s visual perception ability with MoVA and conduct
vision-language instruction tuning on high-quality datasets. Despite these improvements, we advise
caution and recommend thorough safety and fairness assessments before deploying MoME models in
any downstream applications.

violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: The formulas are numbered and cross-referenced correctly in this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We fully and clearly describe the model architecture in the main body, and
provide a detailed training process and model configuration in the Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

19


---Page Break---
Answer: [No]

Justification: We use publicly available datasets for training and evaluation, which enables
easy reproducibility. Upon acceptance, we will release the code and data.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed training and test configuration details in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: MLLM researches typically do not test and report error bars of experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

20


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide sufficient information on the computer resources in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss societal impacts in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

21


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We describe safeguards about the pre-trained language model in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] .
Justification: The creators and original owners of the assets used in the paper are properly
credited and explicitly mentioned with respect.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

22


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We will release our code with detailed documentation in the future.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: we do not conduct any crowdsourcing experiments so this item is not applica-
ble.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: we do not conduct any experiments with human subjects so this item is not
applicable.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
