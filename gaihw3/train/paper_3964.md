Abstract

Given the vast number of classifiers that have been (and continue to be) proposed,
reliable methods for comparing them are becoming increasingly important. The
desire for reliability is broken down into three main aspects: (1) Comparisons
should allow for different quality metrics simultaneously. (2) Comparisons should
take into account the statistical uncertainty induced by the choice of benchmark
suite. (3) The robustness of the comparisons under small deviations in the under-
lying assumptions should be verifiable. To address (1), we propose to compare
classifiers using a generalized stochastic dominance ordering (GSD) and present the
GSD-front as an information-efficient alternative to the classical Pareto-front. For
(2), we propose a consistent statistical estimator for the GSD-front and construct
a statistical test for whether a (potentially new) classifier lies in the GSD-front
of a set of state-of-the-art classifiers. For (3), we relax our proposed test using
techniques from robust statistics and imprecise probabilities. We illustrate our
concepts on the benchmark suite PMLB and on the platform OpenML.

Introduction

The comparison of classifiers in machine learning is usually carried out using quality metrics
ϕ : C × D →[0, 1], i.e., bounded functions assigning a real number to every pair (C, D) of classifier
and data set from a suitable domain C × D, where, by construction, higher numbers indicate better
quality. However, in many applications, the choice of a unique quality metric used for the comparison
is not self-evident. Instead, competing quality metrics are available, each of which can be well-
motivated but may lead to a different ranking of the analyzed classifiers. One attempt to safeguard
against this effect is to use multidimensional quality metrics: instead of a single metric, one chooses
a set of metrics Φ := (ϕ1, . . . , ϕn) : C × D →[0, 1]n that – taken together – provide a balanced

foundation for assessing the quality of classifiers. Generally, we distinguish two (related but) different
motivations for choosing multidimensional quality metrics:

Performance is a latent construct: The application at hand suggests a very clear evaluation concept,
which, however, is too complex to be expressed in terms of a single metric. In this case, the latent
construct to evaluate is operationalized with a set of quality metrics (that serve as an approximation).
For example, the latent construct of robust accuracy can be operationalized by taking together the
following three quality metrics: Accuracy of a classifier (i.e., the proportion of correctly predicted
labels), and robustness of this proportion under weak perturbations of the data in either the features
or the target variable. This will be exemplified in Section 5.2 using the PMLB benchmark suite.

Quality is a multidimensional concept: Even if the application at hand suggests evaluation criteria
that can be perfectly expressed using quality metrics, it can still be desirable to compare the classifiers
under consideration in terms of various contentual dimensions. For example, one can be interested in
how well a classifier performs in the trade-off between accuracy and computation time in the training
and the test phase: Clearly distinguishable contentual dimensions are included and the analysis aims
at investigating how the different classifiers under consideration trade-off between these dimensions.
This will be exemplified in Section 5.1 using one of OpenML’s benchmark suites.

Regardless of the motivation for considering multidimensional quality metrics, their interpretative
advantage naturally comes at a price: Without further assumptions, classifiers will often be incom-
parable, as the quality metrics in the different dimensions contradict each other in their ranking.2
Already on one data set, a multidimensional quality metric only induces a (natural yet potentially
incomplete) preorder: a classifier is rated at least as good as a competitor if (and only if) it receives at
least the same metric value in each dimension. The problem of incomparability becomes even more
severe for multiple data sets (as considered here). In this case, one of the following analysis paths is
often chosen: (I) An expected weighted sum (for example, weighted by importance) of the individual
quality metrics is considered and the problem is then analyzed on this new pooled quantity.3 (II)
The problem is analyzed based on the Pareto-front par(Φ), i.e., the set of all classifiers that are not
component-wise (strictly) dominated by any competitor, whose definition followed by an illustrative
example are included for reference.

Definition 1. Let ˜D ⊆D be some set of data sets. The ˜D-Pareto front par(Φ, ˜D) of Φ is given by

C ∈C|∄C′ ∈C ∀D ∈˜D : Φ(C′, D) ⋗Φ(C, D)
	
,

where ⋗is the strict part of the component-wise ≥-relation on Rn. Set par(Φ) :=par(Φ, D).

Example 1. Consider the following schematic example of three classifiers C = {C1, C2, C3}
evaluated for a fictitious population of four data sets D = {D1, D2, D3, D4}. Every entry gives the
two-dimensional evaluation Φ(C, D) of a classifier on a data set w.r.t. predictive accuracy and the
computation time for training in three ordinal categories fast, medium and slow.

(0.96, slow)
C3
(0.99, slow)
(0.91, fast)
(0.85, fast)
(0.75, slow)

Here, it holds that Φ(C2, Di) ⋗Φ(C1, Di) for all i = 1, 2, 3, 4, i.e., C1 is component-wise (strictly)
dominated by C2. Classifiers C2 and C3 are not component-wise (strictly) dominated. Thus, the
Pareto-front is given by par(Φ) = {C2, C3}.

Both approaches are extreme in a certain sense: (I) reduces the multidimensional information structure
of the problem to one single real-valued score. Any selection of classifier based on this score will
heavily depend on the choice of the weights in the sum score and, therefore, becomes dubious once

2This effect is usually more pronounced under the second motivation: Whereas in the first case the different
metrics attempt to formalize the same latent construct, here different quality dimensions are actually to be
covered. E.g., an improvement in accuracy may often be accompanied by a deterioration in computation time.
3There, one interprets the data sets as realizations of a random variable T : Ω→D on some probability
space (Ω, S, π), chooses weights w1, . . . , wn ∈R+ and assigns each C ∈C the value Pn
i=1 wiEπ(ϕi(C, T)).

this choice is not perfectly justified. This seems even more severe for problems where some of the
involved quality metrics might only allow for an ordinal interpretation, e.g., feature sparseness as
a proxy for interpretability [75], risk levels in the EU AI act [50] or other regulatory frameworks
[73], robustness (see experiments in Section 5.2) or runtime levels (Section 5.1). Opposed to this,
(II) seems to be very conservative: By considering classifiers that are in the Pareto-front par(Φ), one
(potentially) completely ignores both information encoded in the cardinally interpretable dimensions
and information about the distribution of the data sets. As a trade-off between these two extremes,
which utilizes the complete available information but avoids the choice of weights, it has recently
been proposed to compare classifiers under multidimensional quality metrics using generalized
stochastic dominance (GSD) [45]. The rough idea of this approach is to first embed the range of
the multivariate performance measure in a special type of relational structure, a so-called preference
system, which then allows for also formalizing the entire information originating from the cardinal
dimensions of the quality metric. A classifier is then judged at least as good as a competitor (similar
to classic stochastic dominance), if its expected utility is at least as high with respect to every utility
function representing (both the ordinal and the cardinal parts of) the preference system (also see
Definition 5). Although GSD also induces only a preorder, the set of not strictly dominated classifiers
will generally be considerably smaller than under the classical Pareto analysis. Furthermore, it
avoids potentially difficult to justify assumptions about the weighting of the different quality metrics.
Therefore, working with the GSD-front, as introduced below, will prove to be a very promising
analysis option; it combines the advantages of the conservative Pareto analysis with those of the
liberal comparison of weighted sums.

Our contribution

GSD-Front: We introduce the concept of the GSD-front (see, after some preparations, Definition 6)
and characterize it in Theorem 2 as more discriminative than the Pareto-front. In this sense, the
GSD-front is an information-efficient way to handle the multiplicity/implicit multidimensionality of
quality criteria, powerfully exploiting their ordinal and quantitative components.

Proper handling of statistical uncertainty; estimating and testing: Since typically the available
data sets are just a sample of the corresponding universe, empirical counterparts of the major concepts
are needed to do justice to the underlying statistical uncertainty. In particular, we give a sound
inference framework: Firstly, we propose a set-valued estimator for the GSD-front and provide
sufficient conditions for its consistency (see Theorem 1 and Remark 3). Secondly, we develop static
and dynamic statistical permutation-tests if a classifier is in the GSD-front and prove their level-α−
validity and their consistency (see Theorem 3).

Robustification: Additionally, we recognize the fact that the underlying assumption of identically
and independently distributed (i.i.d.) sampling is questionable in many benchmarking studies. Thus,
in Section 4.2 we quantify how robust the test decisions are under such deviations.

Experiments with benchmark suites and implementation: We illustrate the concepts and corrob-
orate their relevance with experiments run over two benchmark suites (PMLB and OpenML, see
Section 5), based on an implementation that is freely available and easily adaptable to comparable
problems.4. We consider experiments with mixed-scaled (ordinal and cardinal) multidimensional
quality metrics, also incorporating (potentially) ordinal criteria.

Benchmarks are the foundations of applied machine learning research [27, 90, 78, 65, 91]. Specifically,
benchmarking classifiers over multiple data sets is a much-studied problem in machine learning,
as it enables practitioners to make informed choices about which methods to consider for a given
data set. Furthermore, also proposals for novel classifiers must often first demonstrate their potential
for improvement in benchmark studies. Examples include [58, 40, 31, 57, 12]. In recent years,
in recognition of the fact that the benchmark suite under consideration is only a sample of data
sets, especially focusing on statistically significant differences between classifiers has received great
interest (see, e.g., [24, 35, 34, 19, 45] or, e.g., [9, 22, 8] for Bayesian variants). An R implementation
of some of these tests is described in [15], whereas use-cases in the context of time series and

neural networks for regression are discussed in [44, 36]. The diversity and the associated problem
of selecting quality metrics (e.g., [51]) is currently attracting a great deal of interest (e.g., [89]).
Consequently, finding ways for comparing classifiers in terms of multidimensional quality metrics is
intensively studied, ranging from multidimensional interpretability measures (e.g., [59]) over classical
Pareto-analyses (e.g., [31]) to embeddings in the theory of data depth (e.g., [13, 71]). While utilizing
variants of stochastic dominance in statistics is quite common (e.g., [56, 61, 6, 76, 67]), the same
seems not to hold for machine learning. Exceptions include [23] in an optimization context, [47,
48], who investigate special types of stochastic orders, and [45], utilizing already GSD-relations for
classifier comparisons without the GSD-front. Finally, relying on imprecise probabilities (e.g., [85,
86, 3]) to robustify statistical hypotheses follows the tradition of [66, 42, 41, 2], see also, e.g., [5, 25,
4, 60, 48]. For application to Bayesian networks, see, e.g, [55, 14, 54], and [81, 69, 18, 80, 1, 70, 52,
30, 16, 17], among others, for robustified machine learning in this spirit.

Decision-theoretic preliminaries

The relevant basic concepts in order theory are collected in Appendix A.1. Based on these we can
make the following definition, originating from the decision-theoretic context discussed in [46].
Definition 2. Let A be a non-empty set, R1 ⊆A×A a preorder on A, and R2 ⊆R1 ×R1 a preorder
on R1. The triplet A = [A, R1, R2] is then called a preference system on A. The preference system
A′ = [A′, R′
1, R′
2] is called subsystem of A if A′ ⊆A, R′
1 ⊆R1, and R′
2 ⊆R2.

In our context, R1 formalizes the ordinal information, i.e., the information about the ranking of the
objects in A, whereas R2 describes the cardinal information, i.e., the information about the intensity
of certain rankings. To ensure that R1 and R2 are compatible, we use a consistency criterion relying
on the idea of simultaneous representability of both relations. For this, for a preorder R, we denote
by IR its indifference and by PR its strict part (see A.1).
Definition 3. The preference system A = [A, R1, R2] is consistent if there exists a representation
u : A →R such that for all a, b, c, d ∈A we have:

i) (a, b) ∈R1 ⇒u(a) ≥u(b) with equality iff (a, b) ∈IR1

ii) ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈R2 ⇒u(a) −u(b) ≥u(c) −u(d) with equality iff ((a, b), (c, d)) ∈IR2

The set of all representations of A is denoted by UA.

Finally, we need to recall the concept of generalized stochastic dominance (GSD) (see, e.g., [48]),
which is crucial for the concepts presented in this paper: For a probability space (Ω, S, π) and a
consistent preference system A, we define by F(A,π) the set of all X ∈AΩsuch that u ◦X ∈
L1(Ω, S, π) for all u ∈UA. We then can define the GSD-preorder on F(A,π) as follows.

Definition 4. Let A = [A, R1, R2] be consistent. For X, Y ∈F(A,π), say X (A, π)-dominates Y if
Eπ(u ◦X) ≥Eπ(u ◦Y ) for all u ∈UA. Denote the induced GSD-preorder on F(A,π) by R(A,π).

GSD for classifier comparison

We return to the initial problem: Assume we are given a finite set C of classifiers, an arbitrary set D
of data sets and n quality metrics ϕ1, . . . , ϕn : C × D →[0, 1], combined to the multidimensional
quality metric Φ := (ϕ1, . . . , ϕn) : C × D →[0, 1]n. As we also want to allow ordinal quality
metrics, we assume that, for 0 ≤z ≤n, the metrics ϕ1, . . . , ϕz are of cardinal scale (differences may
be interpreted), while the remaining ones are purely ordinal (differences are meaningless apart from
sign). We embed the range Φ(C × D) of Φ in the following preference system:

P = [[0, 1]n, R∗
1, R∗
2] , where
(1)

R∗
1 =
n
(x, y) : xj ≥yj ∀j ≤n

, and R∗
2 =

(

((x, y), (x′, y′)) : xj −yj ≥x′
j −y′
j ∀j ≤z
xj ≥x′
j ≥y′
j ≥yj ∀j > z

)

.

R∗
1 is the usual component-wise ≥-relation. For R∗
2, one pair of consequences is preferred to another
if, in the ordinal dimensions, the exchange associated with the first pair is not a deterioration to the

4


---Page Break---
exchange associated with the second pair and, in addition, there is component-wise dominance of the
differences of the cardinal dimensions. In order to transfer the GSD-relation from Definition 4 to
the case of comparing classifiers under multidimensional performance metrics, we interpret the data
sets in D as realizations of a random variable T : Ω→D on some probability space (Ω, S, π). We
then associate each classifier C ∈C with the random variable ΦC := Φ(C, T(·)) on Ωand compare
classifiers by comparing the associated random variables by means of GSD.

Definition 5. Denote by PΦ the preference system obtained by restricting P to Φ(C × D). Further,
let C be such that {ΦC : C ∈C} ⊆F(PΦ,π). For C, C′ ∈C, say that C dominates C′, abbreviated
with C ≿C′, whenever (ΦC, ΦC′) ∈R(PΦ,π).

In the application situation, instead of the true GSD-order ≿among classifiers, we will often have to
get along with its empirical analogue, i.e., the GSD-relation where a sample of data sets is treated
like the underlying population and the true probability measure is replaced by the corresponding
empirical ones. More precisely, we assume that we have sampled i.i.d. copies T1, . . . , Ts of T and
then define the set Zs :=

Φ(C, Ti) : i ≤s ∧C ∈C
	
, of (random) observations under the different
classifiers. We then use W to denote the (random) subsystem of P that arises when P is restricted to
the (random) set Zs. For C, C′ ∈C we define the random variable

ds(C, C′) := infu∈UW
X

z∈Zs u(z)(ˆπC({z}) −ˆπC′({z})),

where, for M ⊆[0, 1]n, we set ˆπC(M) := 1

s|

i : i ≤s ∧Φ(C, Ti) ∈M
	
|. For a concrete sample
associated to ω0 ∈Ω, we then say that C empirically GSD-dominates C′, if ds(C, C′)(ω0) ≥0.
Intuitively, ds can thus be used to check whether the classifier C empirically dominates the classifier
C′ with respect to GSD in the samples at hand (i.e., in the benchmark suite under investigation).

Based on these concepts, we can now define the sets of (empirically) GSD-undominated classifiers.

Definition 6. Let C be such that {ΦC : C ∈C} ⊆F(PΦ,π). Let denote T1, . . . , Ts i.i.d. copies of T.

i) The GSD-front is the set

gsd(C) :=

C ∈C : ∄C′ ∈C s.t. C′ ≻C
	
,

where ≻denotes the strict part of ≿.

ii) Let ε ∈[0, 1]. The ε-empirical GSD-front is the (random) subset of C defined by

egsdε
s(C) =
n
C : ∄C′ ∈C s.t. ds(C′, C) ≥−ε
ds(C, C′) < 0

o
.

Remark 1. egsd0
s(C) is always non-empty. In contrast, egsdε
s(C) may very well be empty if ε > 0.
Note that choosing values of ε > 0 is intended to make egsdε
s(C) less prone to sampling noise.

Remark 2. Some words on the semantics of the GSD-front: From a decision-theoretic point of view,
classifier C strictly GSD-dominates classifier C′ iff C has at least as high expected utility as C
regarding any compatible utility representation of all the metrics considered, and stricly higher for at
least one such utility. The GSD-front then simply collects all classifiers from C which are not strictly
GSD-dominated by any competitor, i.e., which potentially can be optimal in expectation.

Example 2. Consider again the situation of Example 1 and recall that par(Φ) = {C2, C3} leaves C2
and C3 incomparable. However, if considering only the distribution of the (multivariate) performance
of the classifiers (while assuming a uniform distribution over D), C3 is clearly dominating C2 w.r.t.
GSD: Matching dataset Di with dataset D5−i creates a (strict) pointwise dominance of C3 over C2
(where the strict dominance is due to D1 and D4). Thus, gsd(C) = {C3} ⊊par(Φ) = {C2, C3}.

The following two theorems show that the ε-empirical GSD-front fulfills two very natural require-
ments: First, under some regularity conditions, it is a consistent statistical estimator for the true
GSD-front (Theorem 1). This is important because in practical benchmarking we almost never
have access to the GSD-front of the whole population, i.e., the benchmarking results on all possible
datasets from a specific problem class D. Second, it is ensured that neither the ε-empirical nor the
true GSD-front can ever become larger than the respective Pareto-front, irrespective of the choice
of ε (Theorem 2). This is important as it guarantees our analysis does never conflict with, but is
potentially more information-efficient than a Pareto-type analysis. Proofs are given in B.1 and B.2.

Theorem 1. Denote by IΦ the set of all sets {a : u(a) ≥c}, where c ∈[0, 1] and u ∈UPΦ. Assume
that ≿is antisymmetric. If the VC-dimension5 of IΦ is finite and if ε : N →[0, 1] converges to 0 with
rate at most Θ(1/ 4√s), then (egsdε(s)
s
(C))s∈N is a consistent statistical estimator, i.e.,

where set convergence is defined via the trivial metric.
Remark 3. The assumption of a finite VC dimension is only necessary to ensure that the ε-empirical
GSD front does not become too large. In particular, the following does hold without this assumption:

π

ω ∈Ω: lim

Thus, the ε-empirical GSD-front almost surely converges to a superset of the true GSD-front.
Theorem 2. Assume C with {ΦC : C ∈C} ⊆F(P,π). Let further denote T1, . . . , Ts i.i.d. copies

Statistical testing

We saw the ε-empirical GSD-front can be a consistent statistical estimator and that both the empirical
and the true GSD-front are compatible with the Pareto-front. We now address statistical testing.

4.1
A test for the GSD-front

From now on, we make the (technical) assumption that the order ≿among the classifiers from C is
additionally antisymmetric, transforming it from a preorder into a partial order.6 Equipped with this
assumption, we want to address the question how to statistically test if a given classifier C ∈C is an
element of the true GSD-front gsd(C). To achieve this, we formulate the question of actual interest as
the alternative hypothesis of the test, i.e., we obtain the hypothesis pair:

H0 : C /∈gsd(C) vs. H1 : C ∈gsd(C)

A possible motivation for developing tests on the hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0) is the following: One
would like to compare the quality of a newly developed classifier C for a problem class D with
the classifiers in C \ {C} that are considered state-of-the-art for this problem class, see application
in Section 5.2. If a suitable statistical test would allow the above null hypothesis to be rejected,
then one could draw the conclusion (subject to statistical uncertainty) that the new classifier C on
the problem class D could potentially improve the state-of-the-art. As first step, note that (under
asymmetry) the null hypothesis H0 can be equivalently rewritten as H0 : ∃C′ ∈C \ {C} : C′ ≿C.
This reformulation makes obvious that H0 is false if and only if for every C′ ∈C \ {C} the auxiliary
hypothesis HC′
0
: C′ ≿C is false. Statistical tests for hypothesis pairs of the form (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 )
were proposed (in the context of statistical inequality analysis) in [48]: The authors there showed
how exact statistical tests under i.i.d. sampling can be constructed by using a (non-parametric)
permutation test based on a regularized version dδ
s(C′, C) of ds(C′, C) as a test statistic. The
strength of regularization of the test statistic is there controlled by a parameter δ ∈[0, 1], whose
increase reduces the number of representation functions over which the infimum in the test statistic is
formed, while equally attenuating all quality metrics.7 Due to space limitations, we omit to recall an
exact description of the testing scheme in the main text and instead refer to Appendix A.2.

The idea is then to replace the global test for (H0, ¬H0) with c := |C| −1 tests of hypotheses
(HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) and to reject the null hypothesis at significance level α if all tests reject their individual
null hypotheses HC′
0
at the same significance level α. Call this the static GSD-test. Clearly, this
test tends to be conservative, as it ignores potential correlations of the test statistics for different
pairs of classifiers. Moreover, a slightly modified test in the context of the GSD-front is directly

5The VC-dimension of a set system S is the largest cardinality of a set A with 2A = {A ∩S : S ∈S}.
6This is not very restrictive, it only assumes to consider classifiers that are not already equivalent w.r.t. GSD.
7In both applications in Section 5 the tests are based on the unregularized statistics d0
s(C′, C), as the
regularization performed in [48] aims at reaching a goal which is not primarily relevant for our paper (see A.2.5).

derivable: If one is rather interested in identifying the maximal subset Smax of C for which C
significantly lies in the GSD-front, i.e., in testing ˜HS
0 : C /∈gsd(S) vs.
˜HS
1 : C ∈gsd(S) for
all S ⊆C with C ∈S simultaneously, the following alternative test is a statistically valid level-α
test: First, perform all individual tests for (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) with level α

c . Then identify Smax as the set
of all classifiers from C for which the individual hypotheses are rejected. The (random) alternative
hypothesis ˜HSmax
1
: C ∈gsd(Smax) is then statistically valid in the sense of being false only with
a probability bounded by α. Call this the dynamic GSD-test. We have the following theorem,
demonstrating that the proposed tests are indeed reasonable statistical tests (see B.3 for the proof).

Theorem 3. Let the assumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Then, both the static and dynamic GSD-test are
valid level-α tests. Additionally, both tests are consistent in the sense that under the corresponding
alternative hypothesis, i.e., H1 : C ∈gsd(C) resp. ˜H1 : ∃S ⊆C : C ∈S, |S| ≥2, C ∈gsd(S), the
probability of rejecting the corresponding null hypothesis converges to 1 as s →∞.

4.2
Checking robustness under non-i.i.d.-scenarios

We argue that meaningful benchmark studies should abstain from treating the sample of data sets
in the suite as a complete survey. That is, benchmark analyses should aim at statements about a
well-defined population and regard the benchmark suite as a non-degenerate sample thereof. A
major practical problem in this context is that often little is known about the inclusion criteria for
data sets or test problems in the respective benchmark suite (see, e.g., the discussions in [83, 53,
37]). For instance, the popular platform OpenML [82] allows users to upload benchmark results for
machine learning models with varying hyperparameters, harming representativity, see Section 5.1 and
Appendix C.1. The absence of methods to randomly sample from the set of all problems or data sets
is identified as an unsolved issue in [57, Section 2]. This calls the common i.i.d. sampling assumption
into question, which our (and most other) tests are based upon, and raises the issue as to what extent
statistically significant results depend on this assumption. We now address precisely this question.

In [48] it was shown how the binary tests on the hypothesis pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) discussed in Sec-
tion 4.1 can be checked for robustness against deviations from the underlying i.i.d.-assumption. The
idea here is to deliberately perturb the empirical distributions of the performances for the different
classifiers and to analyze the permutation test used under the most extreme yet compatible worst-case.
The perturbation of the empirical distribution is carried out here using a γ-contamination model (see,
e.g., [85, p. 147]), which is widely used in robust statistics. We now want to adapt a similar robustness
check for the global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0) discussed here. For this, suppose we have a sample
T1, . . . , Ts of data sets (i.e., the benchmark suite). We further assume that k ≤s of these variables
(where it is not known which ones) are not sampled i.i.d., but come from an arbitrary distribution
about which nothing else is known. We then know, for every fixed C ∈C, that its associated true
empirical measure ˆπtrue
C
based on the true (uncontaminated) sample would have to be contained in

MC =

(1 −k

s )ˆπcont
C
+ k

s µ : µ probability measure
	
,
(2)

where ˆπcont
C
denotes the empirical measure based on the contaminated sample T1, . . . , Ts. Note that
MC is by definition a γ-contamination model with central distribution ˆπcont
C
and contamination
degree γ := k

s . In this setting, [48] show that to ensure that their permutation tests used for hypothesis
pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) only advise rejection of the null hypothesis if this is justifiable for any empirical
distribution compatible with the contaminated sample, i.e., for every combination of measures
(π1, π2) ∈MC × MC′, one has to compare the most pessimistic value of the test statistic for
the concrete sample at hand with the most optimistic value of the test in each of the resamples.
Moreover, they show that the (approximate) observed p-values for a concrete contaminated sample
T1(ω0), . . . , Ts(ω0) ∈D associated with ω0 ∈Ωof this robustified test can be expressed by a
function in the number of contaminations k, given by

f(C′,C)(k) := 1 −1

N ·
X

I∈IN 1
dδ
I−dδs(C′,C)(ω0)>
2k
(s−k)
	,

where N denotes the number of resamples, IN is the corresponding set of resamples, and dδ
I is the
test statistic evaluated for the resample associated to I. Due to space limitations, we omit an exact
description of the robustness check for the test on the hypothesis pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) as well as a
derivation of the function f(C′,C) in the main text and instead refer to Appendix A.3.

Similar as shown in Section 4.1, it is straightforward to calculate an (approximate) observed p-value
for the static GSD-test for (H0, ¬H0): We calculate the maximal observed p-value among all C′ ∈
C\{C}, i.e. set FC(k) := max

f(C′,C)(k) : C′ ∈C\{C}
	
. The robustified static GSD-test for the
degree of contamination k can be carried out as follows: Calculate FC(k) and reject H0 if FC(k) ≤α.
This indeed gives us a valid level-α-test for the desired global hypothesis H0 : C /∈gsd(C) under the
additional freedom that up to k of the variables in the sample might be contaminated. Note, however,
that also this test tends to be conservative as both performing the individual tests at level α as well
as the adapted resampling scheme of the permutation test are worst-case analyses. Finally, also the
robustified dynamic GSD-test can be obtained straightforwardly: Under up to k contaminations,
the (random) alternative hypothesis ˜HSmax
1
: C ∈gsd(Smax) is statistically valid with level α if all
individual robustified tests reject HC′
0
at level α

c , i.e., if FC(k) ≤α

c .

We end the section with a short comment on computation: The test statistics for the permutation test
and the robustified variant can be calculated using linear programming. We are guided here by the
linear programs proposed in [48, Propositions 4 and 5]. There are two computational bottlenecks in
the actual evaluation: (1) the creation and storage of the constraint matrices of the linear programs and
(2) the repeated need to solve large linear programs. An efficient, well-commented implementation
that can be quickly transferred to similar applications is made available on GitHub (see Footnote 4).

Benchmarking experiments

We demonstrate our concepts on two well-established benchmark suites: OpenML [82, 11] and
PMLB [64]. While for PMLB we compare classifiers w.r.t. the latent quality metric robust accuracy
(see the first motivation in Section 1), for OpenML we use a multidimensional metric that includes
accuracy and computation time as unidimensional metrics (see the second motivation in Section 1).
The analysis of PMLB is kept short in the main text and detailed in Appendix C. Since the metrics
in both applications are composed of one continuous and two (finitely) discrete metrics, we have
(see B.4):
Corollary 1. In both applications, the ε-empirical GSD-front is a consistent estimator for the true
GSD-front (provided ε is chosen as in Theorem 1).

5.1
Experiments on OpenML

We select 80 binary classification datasets (according to criteria detailed in Appendix C.1) from
OpenML [82] to compare the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Random Forest
(RF), Decision Tree (CART), Logistic Regression (LR), Generalized Linear Model with Elastic
net (GLMNet), Extreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN).8 Our
multidimensional quality metric is composed of predictive accuracy, computation time on the test
data, and computation time on the training data. Since the computation time depends strongly on
the used computing environment (e.g. number of cores or free memory), we discretize the time-
related metrics and treat them as ordinal. Accuracy is not affected by this and is therefore treated
as cardinal. For details, see Appendix C.1. To gain a purely descriptive impression, we computed
the empirical GSD relation. For this, we calculated d80(C, C′) for C ̸= C′ ∈C := {SVM, RF,
CART, LR, GLMNet, xGBoost, kNN} (see Hasse graph in Figure 2 in Appendix C.1). We see that
CART (strictly) empirically GSD-dominates xGBoost, SVM, LR, and GLMNet. All other classifiers
are pairwise incomparable. Three classifiers are not strictly empirically GSD-dominated by any
other, namely RF, CART, and kNN. Thus, the 0-empirical GSD-front is formed by these. While at
first glance this result might seem rather unexpected, a closer look on the performance evaluations
provided by OpenML indeed confirms the dominance structure found, see Appendix C.1 for details.

To move to reliable inferential statements that take into account the statistical uncertainty, we
exemplarily test (at level α = 0.05) if SVM significantly lies in the GSD-front of some subset of C.
As described in Section 4.1, we therefore perform six pairwise permutation tests for the hypothesis
pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) (where C := SVM and C′ ∈C\{SVM}) at level α in case of the static GSD-test
or at level α

6 in case of the dynamic GSD-test.9 That is, we test six auxiliary null hypotheses each
stating that SVM is GSD-dominated by kNN, xGBoost, RF, CART, LR, and GLMNet, respectively.

8For benchmarking deep learning classifiers or optimizers, we refer to future work discussed in Section 6.
9As explained in Footnote 7, we base the tests in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 on the unregularized d0
s(C′, C).

other classifiers on 80 datasets from OpenML. Big (small) vertical lines depict observed (resampled)
test statistics. Rejection regions for the static (dynamic) GSD-test are highlighted red (dark red).
Right: Effect of Contamination: p-values for pairwise tests of SVM versus GLMNet, kNN, RF and
xGBoost.Red lines mark significance levels of α = 0.05 (dark red: α =
0.05

6 ). Significance of
SVM being in the GSD-front remains stable under contamination of up to 7 of 80 datasets.

The distributions of the test statistics are visualized on the left of Figure 1 (densities) and Figure 3
(CDFs) in C.1. They show that the pairwise tests of SVM versus kNN, xGBoost, RF, and GLMNet
reject at level α

6 and, thus, that SVM significantly (at level α) lies in the GSD-front of the subset of C
composed of SVM and these four classifiers. In other words, we conclude that SVM is significantly
(α = 0.05) not outperformed by kNN, xGBoost, RF, and GLMNet regarding all compatible utility
representation of accuracy, training and test runtime. Finally, as discussed in Section 4.2, we turn
to the third aspect of reliability (besides multiple criteria and statistical uncertainty): We analyze
how robust this test decision is under contamination of the benchmark suite, i.e., deviations from
i.i.d.. The results are visualized on the right of Figure 1. It can be seen that the tests at level 0.5

6
of SVM against GLMNet, kNN, RF and xGBoost cease to be significant from a contamination of
(approximately) 7, 8, 11, and 11 of 80 data sets, respectively. That is, the results on up to 7, 8, 11,
and 11 datasets could be arbitrarily redistributed, while maintaining significance of rejection. Since
the significance of the dynamic GSD-test’s decision depends on all pairwise tests being significant at
level 0.5

6 , we can conclude that SVM would still have been significantly in the GSD-front of {SVM,
kNN, xGBoost, RF, GLMNet}, even if 7 out of 80 data sets had been contaminated. Summing up, our
proposed testing scheme not only allowed for meaningful statistical benchmarking of SVM versus
competitors regarding accuracy, test time, and train time; it also enabled us to quantify as to what
degree our conclusions remained stable under contamination of the benchmark suite.

Method comparison: The results highlight the advantages of the GSD-front over existing approaches.
Applying first-order stochastic dominance (a special case of GSD where R∗
2 is the trivial preorder)
on the same set-up, yields that no classifier is significantly larger than (or incomparable to) any
other classifier, based on a 5% significance level. This illustrates that the GSD-approach accounts
for accuracy being a cardinal measure. In contrast, the Pareto-front here contains all considered
classifiers. Thus, the Pareto front is much less informative than the GSD-front, which is also
reflected in Theorem 2. Unlike the Pareto-front, the GSD-front is based on the distribution of
the multidimensional quality metric and not only on the pairwise comparisons, and can use this
knowledge to define the front. Thus, the GSD front is a balance between the conservative Pareto
analysis and the liberal weighted sum comparison. Finally, we want to compare our method with
an approach based on extending the test for single quality metrics proposed in [24] to the multiple
metric setting. We therefore perform all possible single-metric tests as in [24] and define the marginal
front as those classifiers that are not statistically significantly worse than another classifier on all
metrics. However, this procedure can not be used to define a hypothesis test. Therefore, only a
comparison with the empirical GSD-front is meaningful. For OpenML, this marginal front consists
of all classifiers and is less exploratory than the empirical GSD-front. More details on the results of
these other approaches and how these compare to the GSD front can be found in Appendix C.1.

Experiments on PMLB

We select 62 datasets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmark (PMLB) suite [64] according
to criteria explained in Appendix C.2. The following analysis shall exemplify how our proposed
statistical tests can aid researchers in benchmarking newly developed classifiers against state-of-the-
art ones. To this end, we compare a recently proposed classifier based on compressed rule ensembles
of trees (CRE) [62] w.r.t. robust accuracy against five well-established classifiers, namely CART,
RF, SVM with radial kernel, kNN and GLMNet. We operationalize the latent quality criterion
of robust accuracy through i) classical accuracy (metric), ii) robustness of accuracy w.r.t. noisy
features (ordinal), and iii) robustness of accuracy w.r.t. noisy classes (ordinal). Computation of i) is
straightforward; in order to retrieve ii) and iii), we follow [92, 93] by randomly perturbing a share
(here: 20 %) of both classes and features and computing the accuracy subsequently, as detailed in
Appendix C.2. Since there exist competing definitions of robustness [43, 10, 72] and due to the
share’s arbitrary size, we treat ii) and iii) as ordinal and discretize the perturbated accuracy in the
same way as for the runtimes in the openML experiments. Detailed results and visualization thereof
can be found in Appendix C.2. In a nutshell, we find no evidence to reject the null of both the static
and the dynamic GSD-test at significance level α = 0.05. In particular, we do not reject any of the
pairwise auxiliary tests for hypothesis pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) with C := CRE and C′ ∈C \ {CRE}) for
neither α nor α

5 . Our analysis hence concludes that we cannot rule out at significance level α = 0.05
that the newly proposed classifier CRE is dominated by the five state-of-the-art classifiers w.r.t. all
compatible utility representation of the latent criterion robust accuracy.

5.3
Additional recommendations for the end-user

We end the section with a few brief general notes for end-users of our benchmark methodology. This
should make it easy to decide whether a GSD-based analysis is appropriate in a given use-case.

1. GSD-based studies do not primarily aim to identify the best algorithm for a given benchmark
suite. Often, the GSD front contains more than one element. They are rather intended for
checking whether a newly proposed classifier for a certain problem class can potentially
improve on the state-of-the-art classifiers, or whether it disqualifies itself from the outset.
2. GSD-based studies allow statements with inferential guarantees by providing appropriate sta-
tistical tests: Assuming an i.i.d. benchmark suite, a judgment about an algorithm represents
a statement about an underlying population and not just this specific suite.
3. GSD-based studies enable the robustness of the results to be quantified under the deviation
from the i.i.d. assumption: It can be checked which share of the benchmark suite may be
contaminated without affecting the obtained inferential statements.
4. GSD-based studies allow algorithms to be compared w.r.t. multiple metrics simultaneously.
They enable the full exploitation of the information contained in differently scaled metrics.

6
Concluding remarks

Summary: We introduced the GSD-front for multicriteria comparisons of classifiers, gave conditions
for its consistent estimability and proposed a statistical test for checking if a classifier belongs to
it. We illustrated our concepts using two well-established benchmark suites. The results came with
threefold reliability: They included several quality metrics, representation of statistical uncertainty,
and a quantification of robustness under deviations from the assumptions.

Limitations and future research: Two specific limitations open promising avenues: 1.) Comparing
other types of algorithms: We restricted ourselves to comparing classifiers. However, any situation
in which objects are to be compared on the basis of different (potentially differently scaled) metrics
over a random selection of instances can be analyzed using these ideas. For instance, applications of
our framework to the multicriteria deep learning benchmark suite DAWNBench [21] or the bi-criteria
optimization benchmark suite DeepOBS [74] appear straighforward. 2.) Extension to regression-type
analysis: Analyses based on the GSD-front do not account for meta properties of the data sets. A
straightforward extension to the case of additional covariates for the data sets is to stratify by these for
the GSD-comparison. This would allow for a situation-specific GSD-analysis, presumably yielding
more informative results.

Mathematical background

A.1
Basic definitions from order theory

A binary relation R on a set M is a subset of the Cartesian product of M with itself, i.e., R ⊆M ×M.
R is called reflexive, if (a, a) ∈R, transitive, if (a, b), (b, c) ∈R ⇒(a, c) ∈R, antisymmetric,
if (a, b), (b, a) ∈R ⇒a = b, and complete, if (a, b) ∈R or (b, a) ∈R (or both) for arbitrary
elements a, b, c ∈M. A preference relation is a binary relation that is complete and transitive; a
preorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive; a linear order is a preference relation
that is antisymmetric; a partial order is a preorder that is antisymmetric. If R is a preorder, we
denote by PR ⊆M × M its strict part and by IR ⊆M × M its indifference part, defined by
(a, b) ∈PR ⇔(a, b) ∈R ∧(b, a) /∈R, and (a, b) ∈IR ⇔(a, b) ∈R ∧(b, a) ∈R.

A.2
Detailed description of the permutation test from Section 4.1

In this section we describe in detail the statistical test for the hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) discussed
in Section 4.1 and first introduced in [48]. Moreover, we give further details on our proposed extension
of this test to the global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0) in both the static and the dynamic variant.

A.2.1
Preliminaries

Before we can describe the test from Section 4.1 in detail, we first need to recall two more definitions.
Definition 7. Let A = [A, R1, R2] be a preference system. We call A bounded, if there exist
a∗, a∗∈A such that (a∗, a) ∈R1, and (a, a∗) ∈R1 for all a ∈A, and (a∗, a∗) ∈PR1.
Definition 8. Let A = [A, R1, R2] be a consistent and bounded preference system with a∗, a∗as
before. Define
NA :=

u ∈UA : u(a∗) = 0 ∧u(a∗) = 1
	
.

For δ ∈[0, 1), denote by N δ
A the set of all u ∈NA with

u(a) −u(b) ≥δ
∧
u(c) −u(d) −u(e) + u(f) ≥δ

for all (a, b) ∈PR1 and for all ((c, d), (e, f)) ∈PR2.

We now start by describing an adapted version of the permutation test for the hypothesis pairs
(HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) proposed in [48]. For a concrete realization of the i.i.d.-sample of data sets D1 :=
T1(ω0), . . . , Ds := Ts(ω0) ∈D with s ∈N associated with ω0 ∈Ω, we define the set

(C, C′)ω0 = {Φ(C, Di) : i ≤s} ∪{Φ(C′, Di) : i ≤s} ∪{0, 1},

where 0 is the vector containing n zeros and 1 is the vector containing n ones. Denote by Pω0
the restriction of P to (C, C′)ω0. It is then easy to verify that Pω0 is a consistent and bounded
preference system with a∗:= 0 and a∗:= 1. For testing the hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) defined
and discussed in Section 4.1 of the main text, we then use the following regularized test statistic for
the specific sample induced by ω0:

dδ
s(C′, C)(ω0) :=
inf
u∈N
µδ
Pω0

X

z∈(C,C′)ω0
u(z) · (ˆπω0
C′({z}) −ˆπω0
C ({z}))

with δ ∈[0, 1] and µδ := δ · sup{ξ : N ξ
Aω ̸= ∅}, and ˆπω0
C resp. ˆπω0
C′ are the emiprical probability
measures of the performances of C resp. C′ for the specific sample induced by ω0.

A.2.2
Testing scheme for (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 )

We denote our samples as follows:

x
:=
(x1, . . . , xs) := (Φ(C, D1), . . . , Φ(C, Ds))
y
:=
(y1, . . . , ys) := (Φ(C′, D1), . . . , Φ(C′, Ds))

The concrete testing scheme for the permutation test for hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) then looks as
follows:

16


---Page Break---
Step 1: Take the pooled data sample: w := (w1, . . . , w2s) := (x1, . . . , xs, y1, . . . , ys)

Step 2: Take all r :=
 2s
s

index sets I ⊆{1, . . . , 2s} of size s. Evaluate dδ
s(C′, C) for (wi)i∈I and
(wi)i∈{1,...,n+m}\I instead of x and y. Denote the evaluations by dδ
I.

Step 3: Sort all dδ
I in increasing order to get dδ
(1), . . . , dδ
(r).

Step 4: Reject HC′
0
if dδ
s(C′, C)(ω0) is strictly smaller than dδ
(ℓ), with ℓ:= ⌊α · r⌋and α the
significance level.

Note that, for large
 2s
s

, we can approximate the above resampling scheme by computing dδ
I only for
a large number N of randomly drawn I. Moreover, note that only the i.i.d. assumption is needed for
the above test to be valid.

A.2.3
Static GSD-test

As argued in the Section 4.1 of the main part of the paper, if we want to obtain a valid statistical
test at the significance level α ∈[0, 1] for hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0), we can simply perform all
pairwise tests of hypothesis pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) at this same significance level α. We can then reject
the hypothesis H0 at level α if we can reject each hypothesis HC′
0
at level α or, in other words, if

min

(

1
N ·
X

I∈IN 1
dδs(C′,C)(ω0)<dδ
I
	 : C′ ∈C \ {C}

)

≥1 −α.

We call this the static GSD-test.

To see that this procedure indeed gives a valid level-α test for the global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0),
observe that – assuming H0 to be true – the probability of H0 being rejected equals the probability
of all hypothesis HC′
0
being rejected simultaneously. The latter probability – still assuming H0 to
be true – is obviously bounded from above by the probability that one specific hypothesis HC∗
0
is
rejected, which itself is bounded from above by the significance level α by construction.

A.2.4
Dynamic GSD-test

As discussed in the main text and reprinted here again for convenience of the reader, a slightly
modified test in the context of the GSD-front is directly derivable: If one is rather interested in
identifying the maximal subset Smax of C for which C significantly lies in the GSD-front, i.e., in
testing the hypothesis pairs ( ˜HS
0 , ¬ ˜HS
0 ) for all S ⊆C simultaneously, the following alternative test
would be a statistically valid level-α test: First, perform all individual tests for (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) with
level α

c . Then identify Smax as the set of all classifiers from C for which the individual hypotheses are
rejected. The (random) alternative hypothesis ˜HSmax
1
: C ∈gsd(Smax) is then statistically valid in the
sense of being false only with a probability bounded by α. We call this the dynamic GSD-test.

To see that this procedure indeed gives a valid level-α test for the (random) hypothesis pair
( ˜HSmax
0
, ¬ ˜HSmax
0
), observe that – under the null hypothesis – the probability of C lying in the GSD-
front of some random subset S of C is bounded from above by the sum of probabilities of C lying
in the GSD-front of {C, S}, where summation is over all S ∈S. As each of these probabilities is
bounded from above by α

c by construction, the corresponding sum is bounded from above by |S| · α

c .
Finally, as |S| ≤c, this gives the desired upper bound of α.

A.2.5
Computation and regularization

Note that the test statistic dδ
s(C′, C)(ω0) can be computed by solving a linear optimization problem
(see [48, Proposition 4]) and, hence, the test just described is computationally tractable.

Moreover, note that in both applications in Section 5 the tests are based on the unregularized statistics
d0
s(C′, C), as the regularization performed in [48] aims at reaching a goal which is not primarily
relevant for the present paper: The authors there are primarily interested in significantly detecting
GSD of one variable over the other. Consequently, their regularization aims at making the test more
sensitive for exactly this purpose. In contrast, in our study we are primarily interested in significantly
detecting incomparabilities between variables, making the regularization by far less natural.

A.3
Detailed description of the robustness check from Section 4.2

In this section we describe in detail the robustification of the statistical test for the hypothesis pair
(HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) discussed in Section 4.2 and first introduced in [48]. Moreover, we give further details
on our proposed extension of this robustified statistical test to the global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0)
in both the static and the dynamic variant.

A.3.1
Preliminiaries

If we assume, as done in Section 4.2, that up to k ≤s of the observations in our sample T1, . . . , Ts
might be contaminated and, accordingly, follow any arbitrary distribution, then we have to base the
permutation test for hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) on a worst-case analysis of between the measures
contained in MC and MC′ defined instead of the true empirical measures of the two samples
induced by the classifiers C and C′. If again D1 := T1(ω0), . . . , Ds := Ts(ω0) ∈D is a concrete
(now potentially contaminated) sample associated with ω0 ∈Ω, and we again define x and y as in
Section A.2, then the observed contamination models of C and C′ look as follows:

MC(ω0) =
n
(1 −k

s )ˆπcont,ω0
C
+ k

s µ : µ probability measure
o
,

MC′(ω0) =
n
(1 −k

s )ˆπcont,ω0
C′
+ k

s µ : µ probability measure
o
.

A.3.2
Testing scheme for robustified test on (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 )

If we set

dδs(C′, C)(ω0) :=
sup
π1∈MC′(ω0),π2∈MC(ω0)

 

inf
u∈N
µδ
Pω0

X

z∈(C,C′)ω0
u(z) · (π1({z}) −π2({z}))

!

,

dδ
s(C′, C)(ω0) :=
inf
π1∈MC′(ω0),π2∈MC(ω0)

 

inf
u∈N
µδ
Pω0

X

z∈(C,C′)ω0
u(z) · (π1({z}) −π2({z}))

!

,

then the concrete testing scheme for the permutation test for hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) under at
most k contaminated sample members looks as follows:

Step 1: Take the pooled data sample: w := (w1, . . . , w2s) := (x1, . . . , xs, y1, . . . , ys)

Step 2: Take all r :=
 2s
s

index sets I ⊆{1, . . . , 2s} of size s. Evaluate dδ
s(C′, C) for (wi)i∈I and
(wi)i∈{1,...,n+m}\I instead of x and y. Denote the evaluations by dδ
I.

Step 3: Sort all dδ
I in increasing order to get dδ

(1), . . . , dδ

(r).

Step 4: Reject HC′
0
if dδs(C′, C)(ω0) is strictly smaller than dδ

(ℓ), with ℓ:= ⌊α · r⌋and α the
significance level.

The adapted testing scheme just described gives a valid (yet conservative) level-α-test for the
hypothesis pair (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) under at most k contaminated sample members.

Moreover, it directly follows from the discussions in Part C of the supplementary material to [48] that
the (approximate) observed p-value of this test is given by

f(C′,C)(k) := 1 −1

N ·
X

I∈IN
1
dδ
I−dδs(C′,C)(ω0)>
2k
(s−k)
	,

where again N denotes the number of resamples, IN is the corresponding set of resamples, and dδ
I is
the test statistic evaluated for the resample associated to I.

A.3.3
Robustified static GSD-test

As already argued in the main text, it is now easy to calculate an (approximate) observed p-value for
our global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0): We simply calculate the maximal observed p-value among all
C′ ∈C \ {C}, i.e. set
FC(k) := max

f(C′,C)(k) : C′ ∈C \ {C}
	
.

18


---Page Break---
The robustified test for the degree of contamination k can be carried out as follows: Calculate FC(k)
and reject H0 if FC(k) ≤α, i.e., if the maximal (approximate) p-value of the pairwise tests is still
lower or equal than the significance level.

The argument that the testing procedure just described indeed produces a valid level-α test of the
global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0) under up to k contaminated data sets in the sample, can be carried
out completely analogous as done in Appendix A.2.3.

A.3.4
Robustified dynamic GSD-test

Finally, as discussed in the main text and reprinted here again for convenience of the reader, also
the robustified dynamic GSD-test can be obtained in a straightforward manner: Under up to k
contaminated data sets in the sample, the (random) alternative hypothesis ˜HSmax
1
: C ∈gsd(Smax)
from before is statistically valid with level α if all individual robustified tests reject HC′
0
at level α

c ,

The argument that the testing procedure just described indeed produces a valid level-α test for the
(random) hypothesis pair ( ˜HSmax
0
, ¬ ˜HSmax
0
) under up to k contaminated data sets in the sample, can be
carried out completely analogous as done in Appendix A.2.4.

A.3.5
Computation and regularization

Note that also the robustified test statistic dδs(C′, C)(ω0) can be computed by solving a linear
optimization problem (see [48, Proposition 6]) and, hence, the test just described is computationally
tractable.

Again, note that the tests in Section 5 are based on the unregularized test statistics with δ = 0. The
reason for this is the same as discussed at the end of Appendix A.2.

Proofs

B.1
Proof of Theorem 1

Proof. First, note that for C, C′ ∈C, we have that C ≿C′ if and only if

D(C, C′) :=
inf
u∈UPΦ
(Eπ(u ◦ΦC) −Eπ(u ◦ΦC′)) ≥0.

Thus, the GSD-front can equivalently be rewritten as

gsd(C) =

(

C ∈C : ∄C′ ∈C s.t. D(C′, C) ≥0
D(C, C′) < 0

)

.

Now, let ε : N →[0, 1] : s 7→1/ 4√s. We show that:

C ∈gsd(C) ⇒C ∈lim
s→∞egsdε(s)
s
(C) π-a.s. , and
(3)

C /∈gsd(C) ⇒C /∈lim
s→∞egsdε(s)
s
(C) π-a.s.
(4)

Note that the proof immediately translates to the more general case of ε(s) ∈Θ(1/ 4√s) as stated
in Theorem 1. Denote with ˆE the expectation w.r.t. the empirical measure associated with the i.i.d.
sample10 (T1, . . . , Ts). For Implication (3), assume that C ∈gsd(C). Then for every other classifier
C′ there exists an utility function u ∈UPΦ with Eπ(u ◦ΦC) > Eπ(u ◦ΦC′) (Otherwise we would
have D(C′, C) ≥0 and D(C, C′) < 0, where the second statement is due to antisymmetry). For
these corresponding utility functions, because of the strong law of large numbers, we would get
ds(C′, C) ≤ˆE(u ◦ΦC′) −ˆE(u ◦ΦC)
a.s.
−→c < 0. Since C consists only of finitely many classifiers,
egsdε(s)
s
(C) will almost surely not contain C asymptotically. Note that for Implication (3) to hold,

10Note that assuming only an exchangeable sample would also suffice. Note further that we have to assume
the measurability of the involved infimum type statistics. For more details on this issue, see, e.g., [28].

---Page Break---
it is only necessary that ε(s) converges to zero as s goes to infinity. The order of convergency as
Θ(1/ 4√s) is only needed for Implication (4).

For Implication (4) assume that C /∈gsd(C). Then there exists a classifier C′ with D(C′, C) ≥0
and D(C, C′) < 0. An analog argumentation like above shows that ds(C, C′) converges almost
surely to a value smaller than zero. It remains to analyze D(C′, C). For this, we have to show that
ds(C′, C) + ε(s)
a.s.
−→c ≥0. We utilize uniform convergence: For arbitrary ξ > 0, [84, p. 192

If the VC dimension h is finite, the term 8

the term exp {−√s/64} is exponentially decreasing in √s (or s). Therefore, the right hand side of

ˆE(u ◦ΦC) −ˆE(u ◦ΦC′)
 −ε(s)

converges in probability to a value c ≤0 or equivalently, that ds(C′, C) + ε(s) converges to a value
c ≥0. Since the right hand side of Inequality (5) converges exponentially in s, the Borel-Cantelli
theorem (cf., e.g., [29, p.67ff]) gives also strong convergency, which completes the proof. Note that it
is not necessary to specify ε(s) concretely as 1/ 4√s. It would be sufficient to define ε(s) as of the
order of Θ(1/ 4√s).

B.2
Proof of Theorem 2

Proof. i) Assume that C /∈par(Φ). Then, by definition of par(Φ), there exists C′ ∈C such that
for all D ∈D it holds that Φ(C′, D) ⋗Φ(C, D). This implies that for all D ∈D it holds that
(Φ(C′, D), Φ(C, D)) ∈PR∗
1. Now, choose u ∈UPΦ. Since u then, by definition, is strictly isotone
with respect to PR∗
1, this allows us to conclude that the function u(Φ(C′, ·)) −u(Φ(C, ·)) is strictly
positive, i.e., we have u(Φ(C′, D)) −u(Φ(C, D)) > 0 for arbitrary D ∈D.

We compute:

Eπ(u ◦ΦC′) −Eπ(u ◦ΦC)
=
Z

Ω
u(Φ(C′, T(ω)))dπ(ω) −
Z

Ω
u(Φ(C, T(ω)))dπ(ω)

=
Z

Ω
u(Φ(C′, T(ω))) −u(Φ(C, T(ω)))
|
{z
}
>0 for all ω∈Ω, since T (ω)∈D

dπ(ω) > 0

20


---Page Break---
This gives Eπ(u◦ΦC′) > Eπ(u◦ΦC). As u was chosen arbitrarily, this implies that C′ ≻C. Hence,
by definition of the GSD-front, we have C /∈gsd(C).

ii) First, note that both postulates are statements involving random sets (i.e., sets dependent on
the realizations of the variables T1, . . . , Ts). Thus, we have to prove both statements for arbitrary
realizations of these variables. So let D1 := T1(ω0), . . . , Ds := Ts(ω0) ∈D be an arbitrary
realisation. For this concrete realization of the sample, the first statement is immediate, since if there
is no C′ such that ds(C′, C)(ω0) ≥−ε2 there is also no C′ such that ds(C′, C)(ω0) ≥−ε1 (as the
latter is harder to satisfy due to ε1 ≤ε2).

Again for the chosen concrete realization of the sample, the second postulate is an immediate
consequence of statement i) from above. As in both situations the realization of the variables was
chosen arbitrarily, this implies the statement.
□

B.3
Proof of Theorem 3

To see that the static test is a valid level-α test for the global hypothesis pair (H0, ¬H0), observe
that – assuming H0 to be true – the probability of H0 being rejected equals the probability of all
hypothesis HC′
0
being rejected simultaneously. The latter probability – still assuming H0 to be true
– is obviously bounded from above by the probability that one specific hypothesis HC∗
0
is rejected,
which itself is bounded from above by the significance level α by construction.

Furthermore, the reason for the consistency of the static test is the following: First, note that under the
assumption of Theorem 1 (because of the finite VC dimension), we have that ds(C′, C) converges to
D(C′, C) in probability for every abrbitrary classifier C′ ̸= C. Therefore, for fixed C′ and under the
null hypothesis HC′
0 , we have ds(C′, C) converges in probability to a value larger than or equal to
zero. This implies that under this null hypothesis the implicit critical values of the permutation test
become arbirarily close to a values larger than or equal to zero.

Now, let C be in the GSD-front. Then, due to antisymmetry of ≿, for every other classifier C′, there
exists a utility for which the expectation of u ◦ΦC is larger than the expectation of u ◦ΦC′. Because
of the weak law of large numbers, this translates to the empirical expectations with an arbitrarily high
probability if only the sample size is large enough. Therefore, all-together, as s converges to infinity,
the test rejects the null hypothesis in this situation with arbitrary high probability. Finally, since we
have only a finite number of hypothesis of the static test, this also translates to the static test itself.
Therefore the static test is indeed a consistent level-α test.

To see that also the dynamic test is a valid level-α test for the (random) hypothesis pair
( ˜HSmax
0
, ¬ ˜HSmax
0
), observe that – under the null hypothesis – the probability of C lying in the GSD-
front of some random subset S of C is bounded from above by the sum of probabilities of C lying
in the GSD-front of {C, S}, where summation is over all S ∈S. As each of these probabilities is
bounded from above by α

c by construction, the corresponding sum is bounded from above by |S| · α

c .
Finally, as |S| ≤c, this gives the desired upper bound of α.

Finally, also the consistency of the dynamic test follows from the fact that it is constructed from a
finite set of consistent tests for every possible set S ⊆C.
□

B.4
Proof of Corollary 1

Assume that Φ(C × D) ⊆M × S1 × S2, where S1, S2 ⊂[0, 1] are finite, and M ⊆[0, 1] is arbitrary.
This is possible since by definition of Φ we have M ⊆ϕ1(C × D) and S1 ⊆ϕ2(C × D) and
S2 ⊆ϕ3(C × D), and the metrics ϕ2 and ϕ3 are assumed to be finitely discrete. We show that
the width11 of the restriction of R∗
1 to Φ(C × D) is finite. It then follows directly from e.g. [76,
Proposition 2] that the VC-dimension of

IΦ :=
n
{a : u(a) ≥c} : c ∈[0, 1] ∧u ∈UPΦ
o

is also finite. The claim then follows from Theorem 1.

11The width of a preordered set is the maximal cardinality of an antichain, i.e., the maximal number of
pairwise incomparable elements.

21


---Page Break---
To show the finiteness of the width, assume - wlog - that |S1| = g < ∞and |S2| = h < ∞.
Assume, for contradiction, that there exists an antichain12 Q ⊆Φ(C × D) within the restriction of
R∗
1 to Φ(C × D) of cardinality strictly greater than g · h. Then there exist x = (x1, x2, x3), y =
(y1, y2, y3) ∈Q such that x2 = y2 and x3 = y3 (as there are only g · h different combinations of the
second and the third component). However, since the first component is completely ordered by ≥,
this implies either (x, y) or (y, x) (or both) is contained in the restriction of R∗
1 to Φ(C × D). This is
a contradiction to x and y being elements of the same antichain Q, completing the argument.

Experiments with OpenML

This sections gives further insight to the example on the OpenML data analysed in Section 5.1.
We start with giving more details on the data set with all the computation settings of the classifier
algorithms. Afterwards, we provide more graphics and explanations of the analysis.

C.1.1
Data

Overall, we are comparing the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to further 6 classifier
algorithms on 80 data sets. The data sets as well as the performance evaluation is given by the
OpenML library [82].13 The analysis is restricted to binary classification problems. We selected those
data sets of OpenML that evaluated the predictive accuracy, train data time computation and test data
time computation (both measured in milliseconds) for all of the 7 algorithms. Since the computation
times depend on the environment, i.e. the number of cores used or the free memory, we discretized
the computation times and considered them as ordinal. Therefore, we divided each computation time
into ten categories, where category one contains the 10% highest times, and so on. Moreover, we
restricted our analysis on data sets with more than 450 and less than 10000 observations. This gives
us in total 80 data sets.

The algorithms discussed are:

• Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is implemented in the e1071 library [26]

• Random Forests (RF) algorithm is implemented in the ranger library [88],

• Decision Tree (CART) algorithm is implemented via the rpart library [79],

• Logistic regression (LR) algorithm is implemented via the nnet library [68],

• eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost) algorithm is implemented in the xgboost library
[20],

• Elastic net (GLMNet) algorithm is implemented through the glmnet library [32], and

• k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is implemebted via the kknn library [38].

C.1.2
Detailed results of the GSD-based analysis

We started our analysis in Section 5.1 by computing the empirical GSD-front. This gives the Hasse
graph 2, where a top-down edge from C to C′ states that d80(C, C′) ≥0 holds.

In addition to the left of Figures 1 (densities of resampled test statistics) and the right of Figure 1
(effect of contamination on p-values) in the main paper, we include the cumulative distribution
functions (CDFs) in Figure 3. Since we do not include the values of the observed test statistics here,
the differences in distributions are visible to a greater extent. We observe the resampled test statistics’
distributions for SVM vs. xGBoost and GLMNet to be left-shifted compared to SVM vs. CART,
xGBoost, and LR. A visual analysis of the test decision, however, is not possible in the absence of the
observed test statistics. This is why we include their values in the caption of Figure 3.

12An antichain of a preordered set (M, R) is a subset A ⊆M such that for all m1, m2 ∈A it holds
(m1, m2) /∈R and (m2, m1) /∈R.

C.1.3
Detailed results of state-of-the-art analyses and comparison to GSD-front

This section provides the detailed computation of the state-of-the-art approaches and the comparison
with the GSD approach. Here, we go step by step through all the methods touched in Section C.1.

First-order stochastic dominance Analogously to the GSD-front, one can define the front based
on (multivariate) first-order stochastic dominance (see, e.g., [77]). Note that classical first-order
stochastic dominance is a special case of our generalized stochastic dominance (GSD) in the case that
all quality metrics are (treated as) of ordinal scale of measurement. Given the test logic followed by,
for example, [6], for the OpenML data it turns out that no classifier is significantly stochastically larger
than (or incomparable to) any other classifier (based on a significance level of 5 %). Compared to the
results we obtain from our GSD-front analysis, this indiscriminative result is much less informative.

Pareto-front Both for the PMLB benchmark suite and the OpenML setup the Pareto-front contains
all considered classifiers and is therefore not very informative. This shows the advantage of our
approach because our approach is generally more informative (see Theorem 2). In particular, by
using generalized stochastic dominance one refrains from solely relying on pointwise comparisons
of classifiers over datasets. Instead one only looks at the distribution of the multidimensional
quality metric. Beyond this, compared to both a Pareto analysis and a classical first order stochastic
dominance analysis (see above), the GSD approach does justice to the fact that the dimension
accuracy is cardinal and, at the same time, the fact that the other dimensions are of ordinal scale of
measurement. Additionally, compared to an approach that only looks at the marginal distributions
of every single quality metric separately, the GSD approach takes also the dependence structure

23


---Page Break---
between the different quality metrics into account. This is of particular interest if one has different
performance dimensions that are anticorrelated.

Weighted sum approach The GSD-based approach has advantages over an approach of weighted
summation of the various quality metrics especially when it is not clear how specifically the weights
are to be chosen. Specifically, each weighting leads to a total ordering among the classifiers under
consideration. A clear best classifier can, therefore, be identified for each weighting. Thus, different
weightings generally lead to different best classifiers. As a consequence, if one chooses a specific
weighting, one should really be convinced that domain knowledge thoroughly justifies it, as even small
changes in the weighting can completely change the resulting ranking. In contrast, the GSD-based
approach can be used if no weighting of the involved metrics is available, but still more information
(e.g., from the cardinal metrics) is available than required for a Pareto-type analysis. In summary, we
emphasize that our method and the weighted summation should be used under different conditions
and, therefore, complement rather than compete with each other.

Marginal-front A highly popular testing scheme for benchmark analysis is the one proposed by
[24]. We compare our approach against using a marginal front that directly results from following
this scheme. This marginal front is defined as a function of (a) statistical test(s), i.e. classifiers are
in it depending on the test results. We emphasize that this front is not directly comparable to the
GSD-front, since the GSD-front is a theoretical object (like the Pareto front) that can be used to
formulate hypotheses that can then be tested by statistical tests like the ones proposed in this paper.
Thus, we compare the marginal front to the empirical GSD front as reported in Fig. 1 of the paper for
the application on OpenML.

We run multiple single-objective evaluations and include in the marginal-front the classifiers that are
not statistically significantly worse than another classifier on all metrics. For the single-objective
tests, we follow the well-established procedure of [24]. That is, we first run a global Friedman test
(see [33]) for the null hypothesis that all classifiers have no differences with respect to the quality
metric under investigation. In case we reject this null hypothesis, we can run post hoc Nemenyi
pairwise tests (see [63]), comparing the performance of algorithms pairwise, with the null hypothesis
being that there is no difference between their performances w.r.t. the multidimensional quality
metric considered. We would like to emphasize that such an approach does not take into account
the dependence structure among the quality metrics. In other words, it only considers the marginal
distribution (hence the term marginal-front) of the classifiers w.r.t. the individual quality metrics
separately, not their joint distribution. In the following, we conduct the suggested marginal analysis
for OpenML w.r.t. the three-dimensional quality metric considered (accuracy, computation time on
training data, computation time on test data):

Accuracy

• Global Friedman Test: Friedman rank sum test [33] rejects global null of no differences
(p-value = 3.986e-14). This means we can conduct (two-sided) pairwise post hoc tests
(α = 0.05) with no difference as the null hypothesis.
• Post Hoc Nemenyi Test: Table 1 below shows the pairwise comparisons of algorithm
performance with the Nemenyi test [63]. P-values below 0.05 are highlighted and indicate
statistically significant differences in performance.

As becomes evident from the mean values of the three quality metrics and the single-criterion test
results presented above, there is no classifier that is significantly dominated by another classifer w.r.t.
all three quality metrics. Hence, the marginal-front would contain all classifiers and would be rather
indiscriminative compared to the empirical GSD-front that we present in the paper, see Figure 2
Appendix C.1, which contains random forest (RF), trees (CART), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN).
This is in line with our explanation of OpenML results above. Since the quality metrics accuracy,
train time, and test time are only weakly (if at all) correlated due to a trade-off between speed and
accuracy, the marginal-front based on single-criterion comparisons does not facilitate practitioners’
decision-making, while our empirical GSD-front provides valuable insights.

For the sake of completeness, we also report the results of these multiple single-objective evaluations
on the PMLB benchmark suite in tables 5, 6, 7, and 8. The interpretation is completely analogous

to the interpretation of the results on OpenML above. Note that the Friedman rank sum test rejects
global null of no differences for all three criteria. This means we can conduct pairwise post hoc tests
(α = 0.05) with (two-sided) null of no difference.

C.1.4
Discussion of the unexpected results

Recall the discussion in Section 5.1 about the unexpected results. We want to emphasize that these
have a high degree of originality and should be of particular interest to practitioners. This shows
that experience and intuition with a method can also be misleading if only the evaluation framework
is slightly modified: A multidimensional quality metric that seeks the optimal trade-off between
different, potentially conflicting metrics will generally rank differently than a unidimensional one.
In the following, we show that the dominance of CART over xGBoost, SVM, LR, and GLMNet is
indeed consistent with the quality metrics provided by the OpenML repository.

First of all, here, we are interested in the trade-off between accuracy and computation time, (e.g., the
better the accuracy, the higher/worse the computation time). We now look at the comparison between
SVM and CART to demonstrate that the results are indeed in line with the data. We obtain:

• For 27 datasets, CART outperforms SVM on all dimensions (e.g., prediction accuracy,
computation time on test data, and computation time on training data) at once.

• For 9 datasets, CART dominates SVM for at least one quality metric and for all other quality
metrics the performance of CART is not worse.

• For 41 datasets, SVM’s prediction accuracy is better than CART’s. At the same time, CART
outperforms SVM for at least one of the two computation times. The two classifiers are
therefore incomparable for these datasets.

• For 3 datasets CART outperforms SVM based on accuracy, but at least one of the computa-
tion times of SVM is below the one of CART.

Overall, there exists no dataset where SVM dominates CART in all dimensions at once. Either the
two classifiers are incomparable, or CART dominates SVM. Furthermore, CART dominates SVM

for nearly half of the datasets (27 + 9 = 36 of 80). Thus, the dominance structure provided by our
method is in line with the performance evaluation values provided by OpenML.

A second issue that may have influenced the unexpected performance structure obtained in the paper
is the way performance is evaluated by OpenML. OpenML is based on the uploads of its users. Each
user is free to decide which hyperparameter settings to use. Thus, as there might be a different
goal on the hyperparameter setting in each dataset, the results are not representative for the best
performance of each algorithm. This aspect should be included in any further discussion. Especially
since some algorithms are more dependent on hyperparameter settings/tuning than others. For an
example involving hyperparameter tuning that is fixed in advance, see Section 5.2.

C.2
Experiments with PMLB

This sections give further insight to the exemplary benchmarking analysis on the Penn Machine
Learning Benchmarks (PMLB) in Section 5.2 in the main paper. We start by giving more details on
the data sets with all the computation settings of the classifier algorithms. Afterwards, we provide
more figures and explanations of the analysis.

C.2.1
Data

Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks (PMLB) is a collection of curated benchmark datasets for
evaluating and comparing supervised machine learning algorithms [64]. We select all datasets from
PMLB for binary classification tasks with 40 to 1000 observations14 and less than 100 features. On
these 62 datasets15, a recently proposed classifier based on compressed rule ensemble learning [62] is
compared w.r.t. robust accuracy against five well-established classifiers, namely classification tree
(CART), random forest (RF), support vector machine with radial kernel (SVM), k-nearest neighbour
(kNN), and generalized linear model with elastic net (GLMNet). In detail, we deploy

• Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm as implemented in the e1071 library [26]
• Random Forests (RF) algorithm as implemented in the ranger library [88], requiring e1071
library [26] and dplyr [87]
• Decision Tree (CART) algorithm (C4.5-like trees) as implemented in the RWeka library [39],
• Elastic net (GLMNet) algorithm is implemented through the glmnet library [32] requiring
library Matrix [7], and
• k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm as implemented in the kknn library [38].

Note that we used the respective methods in the caret library [49] for hyperparameter tuning and
cross-validation to retrieve i) through iii), as detailed below.

We operationalize the latent quality criterion of robust accuracy through i) classical accuracy (met-
ric), ii) robustness w.r.t. noisy features (ordinal), and iii) robustness w.r.t. noisy classes (ordinal).
Computation of i) is straightforward; in order to retrieve ii) and iii), we follow [92, 93] by randomly
perturbing a share (here: 20 %) of the data points. We randomly selected data points with a selection
probability of 20% and replaced the values by a random draw from the marginal distribution of the
corresponding variable. (This is a slight difference to [92, 93] who replaced the data points by a
random draw from a uniform distribution of the corresponding support of the marginal distribution.)

We then tune the six classifiers’ hyperparameters on a (multivariate) grid of size 10 following [49] for
each of the 62 datasets and eventually compute i) to iii) through 10-fold cross validation.

14[49] requires at least 4 data points in the test set, which translates to a mininmal n of 40, since we deploy
10-fold cross validation.
15Last access of PMLB: 12/05/24.

Figure 4: Hasse graph of the empirical GSD-relation for the PMLB data sets. The blue shaded region
symbolizes the 0-empirical GSD-front, see Definition 6 ii).

C.2.2
Detailed results of the GSD-based analysis

To initially obtain a purely descriptive overview, we construct the Hasse graph illustrating the
empirical GSD relation. In this process, we calculate the value d62(C, C′) for C ̸= C′ ∈C :=
{CRE, SVM, RF, CART, GLMNet, kNN} and connect C to C′ with a top-down edge whenever
d62(C, C′) ≥0. The resulting graph is portrayed in Figure 4. It is evident from the graph that RF
(strictly) empirically GSD-dominates the classifier CRE. All other classifiers are pairwise incom-
parable. Five classifiers, namely RF, CART, kNN, GLMNet, and SVM are not strictly empirically
GSD-dominated by any other considered classifier and, thus, form the 0-empirical GSD-front.

This latter purely descriptive analysis already hints at the CRE not belonging to the GSD-Front. In
order to transition to inferential statements, we aim to statistically test (at level α = 0.05) whether
CRE significantly lies in the GSD-front of some subset of C. As detailed in Section 4.1, we conduct
five pairwise tests for the hypothesis pairs (HC′
0 , ¬HC′
0 ) (where C := CRE and C′ ∈C \ {CRE}) at
a level of α

5 , as explained in Section 4.16 In other words, we test five auxiliary null hypotheses, each
asserting that CRE is GSD-dominated by SVM, RF, CART, GLMNet, and kNN, respectively.

The results of these tests are visualized in Figure 5 (densities) and Figure 6 (cumulative distribution
functions).17 They indicate that the pairwise tests of CRE versus SVM, RF, CART, GLMNet, and
kNN do not reject at a level of α

5 nor at level α. Hence, we conclude that based on the observed
benchmark results we cannot conclude at significance level α = 0.05 that CRE lies in the GSD-front
of any subset of C. In other words, we have no evidence to rule out that CRE is in the GSD-front, i.e.,
we cannot confirm based on the data that CRE is not outperformed by SVM, RF, CART, GLMNet,
and kNN with respect to all compatible utility representation of robust accuracy. As can be seen in
Figure 5, testing CRE vs. CART results in the smallest p-value of all pairwise tests, which appears
plausible, since CRE is a CART-based method. On the other hand, the observed test statistic of CRE
vs. RF is far away from the critical value and the test cleary does not reject, even though RF is also a
tree-based method.

Finally, as discussed in Section 4.2, we further analyze the robustness of this test decision under
contamination of the benchmark suite, i.e., deviations from the i.i.d.-assumption. As opposed to
our OpenML analysis in Section 5.1, see also Appendix C.1, contamination does not affect the
test decisions here, since none of the tests rejects already for uncontaminated samples. Increasing
contamination only drives p-values further. The results are visualized in Figure 7. It is observed that
the tests are neither significant at a level of 0.05

5
nor at 0.05 and this clearly does not change with
growing size of contaminated benchmark data sets.

In summary, the PMLB experiments demonstrated how to apply our benchmarking framework to
the problem of comparing a newly proposed classifier to a set of state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore,
it illustrated our tests’ applications to multiple criteria of mixed scales (ordinal and cardinal) that
operationalize a latent performance measure, namely robust accuracy. It became evident that our
framework allows to statistically assess whether the novel classifier CRE can compete with existing
ones - that is, whether CRE lies in the GSD-front of some state-of-the-art classification algorithms. In

16As clarified in Footnote 7, the tests in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are based on the unregularized test statistics
d0
s(C′, C).
17For generating these plots, we used quantile functions from both base r and the ggplot library. As
the underlying quantile functions definitions differed slightly, we relied on the latter and corrected the
quantiles from the other manually.

ing the visualizations in the paper, we refer the interested reader to https://github.com/hannahblo/

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Abstract and introduction of the paper reflect the paper’s contribution and
scope, covering both theoretical and experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The limitations of the work are discussed in Sections 4.2 and 6 of the main
paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main theoretical results of the paper are stated in Theorems 1, 2 and 3
as well as Corollary 1. For each of these theorems, full sets of assumptions are provided.
Moreover, complete proofs for all these statements are provided in the paper’s appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper fully discloses all information needed to reproduce the experimental
results in Section 5 of the main paper and in Section C of the paper’s appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All data and code needed to reproduce the paper’s experiments are openly
accessible via a GitHub repository. A link to this repository is provided in Footnote 3 of the
main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All necessary background information to understand the papers experimental
results can be found in Section 5 of the main paper and Section C of the paper’s appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All experimental results of the paper are statistically tested for significance.
Moreover, the test decisions are checked with respect to their robustness towards the as-
sumptions underlying the respective tests. Compare Section 4 for theoretical considerations
on testing and Sections 5 and Appendix C for statistical test results of the applications.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

33


---Page Break---
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Information on computer resources is provided in the GitHub repository
referenced to in Footnote 3 of the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper is, in every aspect, conform with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

34


---Page Break---
Justification: We do not foresee direct negative societal impact from the current work.
Positive societal impact in form of making benchmarking results more robust to unjustified
assumptions are discussed in Section 4.2 of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

35


---Page Break---
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

36


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
