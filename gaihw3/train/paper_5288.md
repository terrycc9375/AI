Abstract

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Generative Agents to enhance time series forecasting by reasoning
across both text and time series data. With language as a medium, our method
adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content
with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize
LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like
reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex
events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously
refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent’s output. By inte-
grating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM
to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.

Introduction

Time series forecasting [18, 21] serves as an essential foundation for decision-making across a
wide range of economic, infrastructural, and social domains [2, 13, 14, 16, 56]. The purpose of
analyzing time series data is to decode the evolving relationships within complex, dynamic real-
world systems. Traditional forecasting methods, while effective at identifying patterns in historical
data, perform well when time series distributions remain consistent over time. However, they have
limitations in addressing sudden disruptions or anomalies caused by external random events, and do
not systematically connect complex social events with fluctuations in time series data. Integrating
insights from real-world events and their effects on social and economic behavior is crucial for
improving the reliability and accuracy of time series forecasting.

News articles provide crucial insights into unexpected incidents, policy changes, technological
developments, and public sentiment shifts—factors that numerical data alone may not capture.
Integrating news into forecasting enriches its inputs with context that closely mirrors the complexities
of human behavior and societal changes. On the one hand, news offers a real-time snapshot of events,
enabling the model to adjust predictions based on updated information. On the other hand, qualitative
data from news sources enables the model to account for non-linear and non-numeric influences.
By combining both quantitative and qualitative insights, the model can improve forecast accuracy,
especially in rapidly changing environments, making it more reflective of real-world dynamics.

In this work, we propose a unified approach that embeds news and supplementary information into
time series data using textual prompts. By fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) [54, 55, 66],

and supplementary information from our comprehensive database based on information such as the geographic

we transform time series forecasting into the prediction of the next token in text, taking into account
relevant contextual information. The inductive reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, along with
their ability to model multi-modal distributions, enable few-shot predictions in time series [17]. The
potential of language models in time series forecasting has also been proven [23, 71]. After further
training on our dataset, which includes time series, news, and supplementary information, language
models can generate forecasts that consider the textual context provided in the input prompts.

Effective news filtering is a key issue for enhancing time series forecasting as input diversity increases.
This task requires more than simple keyword extraction; it demands a deep understanding of how news
elements interact with forecast variables, extending beyond linear reasoning to incorporate intelligent
analytical methods. We employ LLM agents [43, 57] with advanced human-like reasoning capabilities
for dynamic and effective news selection. These agents use few-shot learning to adapt their strategies
based on logical scenarios that mimic human reasoning about factors affecting time series fluctuations.
This enables them to identify relevant news, which is then paired with corresponding time series
data to create a context-aware dataset that improves prediction accuracy. Additionally, LLM agents
also play a crucial role in model evaluation, continuously refining their selection logic by comparing
forecast errors with all relevant events. This iterative self-evaluation helps identify and integrate
critical news items previously overlooked. By automating the analysis of unstructured text and
applying chain-of-thought prompting, the agents effectively uncover patterns linking news events to
forecasting discrepancies, revealing the nuanced effects of external factors on predictions.

Our contribution can be summarized as follows:

• The paper introduces a novel time series forecasting framework that integrates unstructured news
data with numerical time series inputs, providing deeper contextual understanding and improving
the model’s responsiveness to social events and real-world dynamics.

• The research highlights the use of LLM agents for dynamic news selection and analysis. We
leverage the reasoning ability of LLM to automate the effective understanding and filtering of

news content. The agents iteratively refine their news selection process based on forecasting
results, improving model accuracy and reliability.
• We propose a data construction method that integrates time series data with news information,
and build a dataset spanning multiple domains to support our research. The dataset includes task-
specific time series data and verified public news reports, which facilitates further exploration in
time series research.
• Our experiment results demonstrate the effective integration of news data, achieving superior
prediction accuracy across diverse domains such as energy, exchange rate, traffic, and bitcoin
domains. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating news is highly adept at navigating com-
plexities, especially in energy demand patterns.

Time series forecasting.
The traditional method of time series forecasting relies on analyzing
historical data and utilizing statistical models to predict future trends, with an assumption that past
patterns will persist in the future [8, 12, 20, 27, 42]. However, these methods were limited to small-
scale datasets. The advent of deep learning [30] has introduced a range of time series forecasting
networks [33, 34, 36, 40, 53, 59, 60, 67, 69] that excel in managing larger, more complex datasets
by capturing non-linearities and dependencies directly from historical data. Recent advancements
include pre-training on diverse, large-scale datasets, allowing models to be fine-tuned on specific
tasks with fewer data and resources [6, 24, 58, 63]. While these methods continue to evolve and
improve performance benchmarks, they often neglect the influence of external and contextual factors.

Attempts to incorporate textual information (e.g., Twitter feeds, news articles, public reports) into
time series forecasting have been made across various domains, such as finance [7, 48, 49], energy
[3, 41], entertainment [26], pandemics [65], and tourism [47]. Traditional methods often simplify
text analysis to counting keyword frequencies [41] or using dummy variables, which do not capture
nuanced meanings. Advanced efforts include extracting richer textual features like word frequencies
and sentiments using traditional NLP [9] and machine learning methods, as demonstrated by Bai et al.
[3]. However, these approaches require labor-intensive feature engineering, struggle with long-text
dependencies, and lack a deep contextual understanding. In contrast, LLMs excel in processing
complex textual data and understanding contextual relationships, which can improve prediction
accuracy and efficiency through automated feature extraction and enhanced scalability across multiple
tasks. Despite their potential, no study has yet fully exploited LLM to enhance forecasting with their
capabilities in understanding unstructured textual data.

Language models for time series forecasting.
LLMs such as the GPT series [1, 4, 44, 45] and
LLaMa [54] have excelled in a variety of natural language processing tasks. With their vast parameter
sets, LLMs acquire extensive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities during pre-training,
which is crucial for building intelligent systems equipped with common sense. LLMs architectures
are increasingly applied to time series processing and forecasting [23, 25, 35, 37, 51]. For instance,
TEMPO [6] adapts GPT architectures for dynamic temporal representation learning, while TIME-
LLM [23] utilizes LLMs for time series forecasting by reprogramming input data and applying
Prompt-as-Prefix techniques. Similarly, FPT [71] demonstrates that even frozen LLMs can perform
effectively in time series tasks, leveraging the universality of self-attention mechanisms. Lag-LLaMa
[46] uses a decoder-only transformer for univariate probabilistic forecasting, and Gruver et al. [17]
show that by framing time series forecasting as next-token prediction, LLMs can surpass traditional
models through effective tokenization and adaptation. However, existing studies mainly utilize the
mapping capabilities of LLMs for numerical regression, without incorporating external textual inputs
or leveraging the reasoning abilities of LLMs in understanding language.

Reasoning with language models.
LLMs can automate tasks with human-like reasoning through
“Chain of Thought” (CoT) prompting [57], enhancing reasoning by step-by-step emulation of human
thinking [28, 32]. CoT prompting is useful for transforming complex questions into answers by
introducing intermediate steps. The “Tree of Thoughts” (ToT) approach [61] refines this by mimicking
trial-and-error methods, enhancing auto-regressive LLMs with a prompter agent, checker module,
memory module, and ToT controller for multi-round dialogues. LLM-based agents can solve tasks by
reflecting feedback signals in text and retaining them in a memory buffer for better decisions [50].
Cai et al. [5] proposed the LLMs As Tool Makers (LATM) framework, where LLMs create reusable
tools for problem-solving, interleaving reasoning and actions to aid task completion and interaction
[62]. These agents can debate their responses and reasoning to arrive at final actions [11].

Method

In this work, we aim to integrate news insights into time series forecasting. The development of
such a system faces several challenges. Firstly, the forecasting method must handle unstructured,
non-numerical news inputs flexibly and adjust predictions based on the context of the news events.
Secondly, constructing this model involves filtering news and establishing connections between
the news and the time series data. This requires sifting through vast amounts of internet data
to find relevant information, demanding deep societal understanding and sophisticated reasoning
skills. Therefore, an intelligent agent is designed to manage this complexity. Moreover, potential
inaccuracies in news selection or inferential errors may still affect the forecast accuracy, requiring
further refinement of news selection and reasoning based on the predictions. Our approach includes
three main modules: a language model-based forecasting module (Sec 3.1), a reasoning agent for
news filtering and inference, and an evaluation agent to assess and refine the forecasting model
(Sec 3.2). The core workflow of our method and the interrelations between these modules are shown
in Figure 1. The subsequent sections will discuss these three modules in detail.

3.1
Rethinking Time Series Forecasting Problem and Elements.

Time series forecasting can be considered as a conditional generation problem of sequences [17].
This aligns with the general paradigm of natural language processing represented by LLMs. Taking the
LLaMa language model as an example, assuming a number series {123,456}, LLaMa’s tokenizer will
regard this number as a sequence of digit tokens, i.e., {“1”,“2”,“3”,“,”,“4”,“5”,“6”}. Given the input
series “123”, the probability of predicting “456” can be represented as a probabilistic forecasting
process in an autoregressive manner: P(“456”|“123”) = P(“4”|“123”) · P(“5”|“4”, “123”) ·
P(“6”|“45”, “123”). Generally, denoting the time series tokens at time t as xt, the LLM predict
the next token in the series xt+1 using the conditional probability distribution P(xt+1|x0:t). During
pre-training, LLMs optimize its internal parameters to maximize this conditional probability over a
wide range of natural language corpora. Though counterintuitive, Gruver et al. [17] have shown that
pre-trained language models exhibit a significant few-shot capability for time series forecasting. This
shows the potential of language models in understanding input digital tokens, and also inspires us to
use the language model as a reasonable platform to study how to introduce the information contained
in textual prompt into time series prediction.

News context offers critical insights into complex social events that traditional numerical data often
overlook, and it also reflects sudden shifts in time series due to random events. In fact, the time series
we collected can already be seen as being influenced by the aforementioned events. Assume an event
E and a time series x0:t, its impact on the future sequence can be expressed also as a conditional
probability P(xt+1|x0:t, E). However, when information about event E is not provided, we can only
predict through historical time series. Although time series data itself can show patterns and trends, it

4


---Page Break---
lacks the ability to indicate the causality behind events. The event information E offers the context
needed to understand why certain spikes or drops occur. We show in Figure 2 some news that are
closely related to time series forecasting.

In language models, news events can also be represented as text tokens. Consider a set of news text
tokens {e0, e1, . . . , eu}, which represent event E. LLMs treat this news information as a condition
input and perform conditional probability predictions P(xt+1|x0:t, e0:u). Including e0:u provides
crucial contextual information that influences the prediction of future values. This process aligns
with the standard approach used by language models to interpret text, allowing for the incorporation
of information about multiple events through various news contexts simultaneously to enhance
prediction accuracy. In practice, we only need to integrate news text with historical time series data
in a prompt engineering manner.

Other supplementary information also provide contextual information for the forecasting model.
For example, weather and climatic factors may affect energy demand and industrial output; financial
indicators and economic metrics influence consumer behavior and business operations. Including
this diverse range of information allows models to adjust for environmental, economic, and seasonal
variations, improving prediction accuracy. The supplementary information can also be understood
as conditions and integrated into the above conditional probability forecasting framework. Our
approach incorporates this information into language for flexible integration with language models.
For example, we use the text “Weather on historical dates: the lowest temperature is 292.01; the
highest temperature is 298.07; the humidity is 94.” to express weather conditions. This enriches the
input to cover various factors affecting the time series. Part (c) of Figure 1 illustrates the method of
prompt integration for time series forecasting and the corresponding responses.

Fine-tuning LLMs for time series forecasting.
Integrating the above information, we can construct
inputs for LLMs to perform time series forecasting. Although pre-trained LLMs are already capable
of generating time series predictions to some extent, relying on these pre-trained models for few-shot
predictions in such a context-rich environment poses several challenges. Firstly, controlling the
output of time series is difficult; predicting long sequences of numerical digit tokens is uncommon
for LLMs. Secondly, the connections between the news and supplementary information and the time
series typically need to be derived from historical data, which goes beyond the usual scope of using
LLMs for few-shot time series predictions. To enable language models to more effectively forecast
time series while considering the conditions imposed by news and supplementary information, we
propose fine-tuning the language models to predict conditional probabilities. We employ a supervised
instruction tuning method to train LLMs on historical time series data paired with corresponding
news and supplementary information, formatted into text input-output pairs (shown in Appendix A.3).
The same loss function used during pre-training is applied here. To fine-tune the LLM, we use
the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method [19], which updates only a small subset of parameters,
reducing computational demands while retaining most of the pre-trained knowledge. This strategy
allows the model to efficiently adapt to new forecasting tasks without losing its foundational strengths.

3.2
Analytical Agent for Aggregation and Reasoning of Contextual News Information.

Next, we construct a dataset to train the above model. While obtaining time series data is relatively
straightforward, matching it with appropriate news and supplementary information is not trivial. The
internet is flooded with news, most of which are irrelevant to the time series we aim to forecast.
Introducing irrelevant news can disrupt forecasting. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the relevance
and causality between the time series forecasting task and the select news accordingly. However,
gaining such an understanding is complex, requiring knowledge of human societal mechanisms and
logical reasoning skills. In our work, we utilize LLMs for filtering and reasoning about news content.
We also recognize that even the most advanced language models cannot complete all reasoning and
judgment in a single generation process. We explain how to use a combination of multiple LLM
generations to create an intelligent agent that fulfills the complex requirements of news filtering.

Time series and news pre-pairing.
For the initial stage of data preparation, news is retrieved to
align with time series data based on matching time frequencies, horizons, and geographical areas.
This synchronization ensures that insights from textual information are timely and regionally relevant.
For example, to understand state-level electricity demand in Australia from 2019 to 2021, we gather
local news from various Australian states and international news occurring in the same period that
might directly or indirectly affect demand. In this way, potentially relevant candidate information can
be roughly selected first, and such filtering can be easily completed through crawler means.

Figure 3: Example of prompt designs for each iteration during fine-tuning. Step 1 involves the reasoning
agent selecting news using default logic. Step 2 evaluates predictions based on validation sets to refine the logic.
In step 3, the updated logic directs data pairing for the next iteration. Full prompts are shown in Appendix A.6.

Reasoning agent for news selection.
We employ an LLM-based reasoning agent capable of
sophisticated tasks such as conversation, reasoning, and semi-autonomous action. This agent is
programmed using detailed prompts that define roles, instructions, permissions, and context, enabling
it to interpret human commands and perform complex tasks. This approach condenses extensive
news datasets into a refined selection of pertinent articles. It leverages its reasoning capabilities to
effectively screen, categorize, and interpret news texts. We employ few-shot prompting [4] and the
CoT [57] method to develop an agent that understands the context of news for forecasting. This
technique enhances the model’s ability to handle multi-step, commonsense reasoning tasks essential
for accurate forecasting. The agent uses multi-step prompts to break down complex problems into
simpler, manageable parts. Our three-phase prompting method, illustrated in Figure 3 Part I, includes:

1. We develop an understanding of time series influencers, sorting them by impact (positive/negative)
and duration (short/long-term), considering economic, policy, seasonal, and technological factors;

2. We direct the agent to filter and categorize news based on either automatically generated logic
or a given reasoning logic, focusing on relevance to time series and classifying the impact (e.g.,
long-term and short-term) along with the rationale;

3. We specify the output format for the agent to organize the selected news into JSON, detailing
aspects like summary, affected region, reporting time, and rationale. More details about our
prompting method can be found in Appendix A.6.

The LLM agent can automatically develop an understanding of time series influencers, with the
option to provide predefined reasoning logic in our models. In the automated process, the agent forms
its logic through prompts designed to guide it in determining how different types of news impact
a specific domain. For instance, we use open-ended questions to allow the agent to independently
summarize and create its own filtering logic. User knowledge can also be incorporated into these
prompts as additional reasoning, enabling the agent to generate more comprehensive logic. The agent
then filters news based on the generated logic, whether fully automated or with user-provided input.

Evaluation agent for reasoning updating.
We also design an evaluation agent to assess and
improve the effectiveness of the aforementioned news filtering. Relying solely on the reasoning agent
for news selection is not optimal, as the interaction between news and time series is complex. The
reasoning agent can only analyze the potential impact of different news from the perspective of news
content, without knowing whether the trained time series forecasting model based on them can make
accurate forecasts. The evaluation agent is deployed after the time series prediction model has been
trained. The evaluation agent extends beyond simple numerical assessments of prediction accuracy
by incorporating human-like logical reasoning to refine the news selection logic chain. We focus our
evaluation on identifying inaccuracies potentially caused by missing news, such as unusual events or
illogical reports. It observes the model’s predictive outcomes to determine if any crucial news has
been overlooked and adjusts the news filtering strategy for the training data based on these results.

Figure 4: Overall pipeline iteratively combines news reasoning agents, fine-tuning, and evaluation agents.

For the evaluation agent, we structured the prompt design into three phases, as illustrated in Figure 3
Part II. In the first phase, we input the forecasting task type, the time horizon, and background
information, which the agent uses to generate the steps for evaluating the prediction outcomes. In the
second phase, we provide the ground truth, the discrepancies between predicted and actual series, as
well as selected and historical news. The agent analyzes these inputs to identify overlooked news
based on the distribution of prediction errors over time. In the third phase, the agent generates
updated logic based on its analysis, guiding future news selection. After processing all validation set
predictions, the reasoning agent consolidates the updated logic into a cohesive final strategy.

3.3
Overall Pipeline

We integrate the news reasoning and evaluation agents with the fine-tuning of the LLM forecasting
model to enhance the quality of training data, as illustrated in Figure 4. In the first iteration, we
use the LLM agent to establish news selection logic based on the domain and timing of the time
series task. This logic directs the reasoning agent to filter relevant news, align it with time series data,
and input it into the model for initial fine-tuning. After validating the model’s predictions with a
validation set, which is randomly extracted from the training data for each iteration, the evaluation
agent checks for any missing news that may have influenced the prediction. This feedback helps the
reasoning agent refine the filtering logic in subsequent iterations. The cycle continues until the final
iteration, where the reasoning agent consolidates all updates to create the definitive news filter for
training the final model. We use the GPT-4 Turbo model as the LLM for the agents described above.

Data preparation

Time series data.
We selected time series data from domains influenced by human activities and
social events to test our method’s ability to capture complex human-driven dynamics during forecast-
ing. These domains include Traffic [39] (traffic volume), Exchange [29] (exchange rate), Bitcoin [15]
(Bitcoin price), and Electricity[15] (Australian electricity demand). To avoid bias from pre-trained
language models, we updated the Exchange and Electricity datasets up to 2022. We use half-hourly
electricity demand data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) (aemo.com.au) and
daily exchange rate data from the Exchange Rates API (exchangeratesapi.io). These datasets
vary in frequency, including daily, hourly, and half-hourly updates, allowing us to evaluate the
algorithms’ effectiveness across different temporal resolutions. More details are in Appendix A.1.
News collection.
Since there are no public datasets that pair time series data with news events, we
have collect news specifically for the above time series to facilitate our research. Some of the news
content is collected from the GDELT dataset [31], a database tracking news from nearly every country
in over 100 languages. GDELT provides real-time insights into societal, political, and economic
events, enabling detailed analysis of global trends and their effects. We incorporate GDELT’s event
information into our forecasting models to enhance predictive accuracy. For domains needing the
latest information, we collect real-time news from sources like News Corp Australia (news.com.au)
and Yahoo Finance (yahoo.com), focusing on region-specific and task-specific activities.

provides daily temperatures, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and humidity, crucial for load
forecasting. Calendar dates, obtained using the Python packages datetime and holidays, account
for seasonal and cyclical effects. Economic indicators are integrated using the pandas_datareader
library, accessing data like GDP, inflation rates, and employment statistics from sources such as the
Federal Reserve, World Bank, and international financial markets.

Effectiveness of news intergration.
In our approach, we incorporate news and supplementary
information into time series forecasting by fine-tuning language models. Firstly, we assess whether
this additional information can enhance time series forecasting. We conducted experiments to verify
the necessity and effectiveness of integrating news data into our forecasting model. We compared
four different scenarios as detailed in Appendix A.2 and Appendix A.3:

1. Pure numerical tokens: Uses numerical tokens, encompassing all variables without news. Except
for region names or date information, it excludes other textual tokens as a baseline for comparison.
2. Textual descriptive sentence tokens: Evaluates whether using sentence-form descriptions instead
of only raw digital numbers can enhance accuracy, with no news integration included.
3. Unfiltered news with textual descriptive sentence tokens: Assesses how integrating descriptive
sentences of time series with unfiltered news data affects the model’s performance.
4. Filtered news with textual descriptive sentence tokens: Shows the effects of integrating descriptive
sentences with news that has been specifically filtered for relevance by the proposed agents.

The performance of different prompt designs is presented in Table 1. It can be seen that the fine-tuned
LLM can be used to forecast time series even when using only digital tokens as prompts. The
introduction of proper news and other supplementary information leads to significant performance
improvements across all four domains. Nevertheless, such improvements are not easily achieved. If
the introduced news information is not carefully selected, it can severely impair the results. There are
two main reasons for this: first, the influx of a large number of news items introduces too many tokens,
which can decrease the performance of the LLM as the number of tokens increases. Second, irrelevant
news can introduce noise and incorrect causal information, leading to misleading predictions.

Effectiveness of the evaluation agent. To make our news filtering and reasoning processes more
effective and comprehensive, we introduce an evaluation agent to reflect on and improve the effects
of news selection based on prediction outcomes. As shown in Table 2, our evaluation agent refines
news filtering through an iterative process, which is reflected in the progressively improved time
series prediction results. The result corresponding to each case is the prediction outcome of the model
after pairing the news selected according to the logic obtained from the corresponding iteration. Our
findings suggest that, in most cases, two iterations are sufficient to achieve significant improvements,
with multiple iterations consistently yielding better results than a single iteration due to the reflection
mechanisms. We also found that this iterative filtering process reveals interesting insights into human
society from the language model agent. These examples are presented in the Appendix A.7.

Compare to other forecasting methods. We also compare our method with existing time series
forecasting techniques, detailed in Appendix A.1. We show a quantitative comparison against
these baseline methods in Table 3. While the baseline methods use inverse normalization to revert
predictions to their original scale, our model operates without normalization. This approach retains

the physical meaning of data, such as electricity demand or economic indicators, ensuring that our
outputs remain interpretable. Normalization could obscure the impact of news events due to the
nonlinear and scale-dependent relationship between these events and the original data values.

Our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods that rely solely on historical time series
data in domains like electricity demand, exchange rates, and the bitcoin market, where events
embodied in the news have substantial impacts. This demonstrates the potential of our method.
However, the improvement from integrating news into the traffic sector is notably modest. The
performance of our traffic forecasting model, which covers all roads in California, is hampered
by the coarse granularity of publicly available news data, lacking the local details necessary for
precise predictions. Traffic data primarily reflects specific road traffic flows, whereas our news
sources are mostly regional or global, failing to capture localized traffic conditions adequately. This
limitation is evident in the model’s Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is sensitive to outliers and
tends to exaggerate errors from traffic spikes that state-level news often does not report. Our model
achieves good results with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), indicating reliable average accuracy.
Incorporating more localized road information could potentially improve these issues.

Figure 5 takes the electricity domain as an example and compares the ground truth with predictions
by cases with or without news data, demonstrating the effect of incorporating news into forecasting
models. The “With News” predictions are closer to the actual values than the “No News” predictions,
particularly at critical timestamps where abrupt events significantly influence electricity demand.

Conclusion and Discussion

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the benefits of integrating news into time series forecasting us-
ing LLM-based forecasting method and LLM-based agents. These agents enhance model intelligence
by autonomously identifying and addressing missed news, refining their logic, and assessing the
impact of events on predictions. Our findings advocate for incorporating extensive domain knowledge,
encouraging a shift towards more nuanced and context-aware forecasting. This approach enriches
time series forecasting for adaptive, comprehensive forecasting aligned with real-world dynamics.

Limitations of our approach.
While our approach demonstrates that LLMs like LLaMa 2 [55]
can enhance time series forecasting by integrating news, there are limitations to its applicability.

The effectiveness of news integration is primarily evident in domains where human and market
activities significantly influence trends. Our framework is less suitable for domains requiring precise
meteorological modeling or where human activities have minimal impact, such as in meteorological
or physical data. Additionally, the model is constrained by the maximum token length of pre-
trained LLMs, complicating the simultaneous processing of large amounts of time series or multiple
sequences, which can lead to data truncation and affect the accuracy of long-term predictions. Finally,
our strategy enhances rather than completely replaces traditional time series tasks like classification
or interpolation across all fields. Our aim is to demonstrate that by leveraging language models, it is
possible to incorporate useful textual information to enhance time series prediction tasks.

Future work.
Future enhancements will focus on extending the current forecasting model’s scope
in several key areas. Firstly, attribution analyses of news content used in the model will pinpoint which
factors most significantly impact forecasting accuracy, facilitating an optimized news integration
process. Advanced analytical toolkits can also be provided to reasoning agents, enabling sophisticated
data processing and real-time application of complex analytical techniques. These developments
will enhance the precision and relevance of the time series prediction model, contributing deeper
contextual insights and expanding its applicability in the predictive analytics field.

Broader impact.
Ethically, it is crucial that we conduct thorough reviews to ensure that our use
of news content does not inadvertently perpetuate biases or negatively influence public opinion.
This involves implementing rigorous checks for accuracy and balance to avoid the risks associated
with misinformation, ensuring that our data sources are credible and that the content is factually
correct. Furthermore, the potential misuse of news, especially the spread of “fake news”, highlights
the need for our models to incorporate sophisticated mechanisms to verify information reliability
before integration. Beyond the discussed sectors, this approach has the capability to extend into
forecasting GDP trends, analyzing carbon emissions, or predicting public health outcomes, each
carrying significant implications for policymaking and public welfare. Thus, while our research offers
substantial benefits in enhancing predictive analytics, it also obligates us to handle these capabilities
responsibly, ensuring our contributions positively impact economic planning, environmental strategy,
and informed decision-making across various domains.

Baselines.
To ensure a thorough evaluation of our model, we selected a diverse set of baselines
that represent the latest advancements in time series forecasting, covering a broad spectrum of em-
pirical studies. Our selection includes transformer-based models, such as transformer-based model:
Informer [67], Autoformer [59], FEDformer [69], Pyraformer [36], PatchTST [40], iTransformer
[38], FiLM [68]. Additionally, we included the CNN-based Timesnet [58] and MLP-based Dlinear
[64]. Finally, we incorporated the LLM-based GPT4TS[70], leveraging GPT2’s generative capa-
bilities. For Informer [67], Autoformer [59], FEDformer [69], Pyraformer [36], PatchTST [40],
iTransformer [38], FiLM [68], and Timesnet [58], we use the code from the Time-Series-Library
(https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/tree/main). For the GPT4TS method,
we use the official code from https://github.com/DAMO-DI-ML/NeurIPS2023-One-Fits-All.
When conducting comparative experiments, all the information utilized in our method, except for
the news content, is also provided to the baseline methods. While our LLM fine-tuning approach
maintains the original scale of the numbers to preserve the physical meaning of the time series data,
we normalize the variables to the range [0, 1] for training the baseline methods. For non-numeric
variables, we represent them using dummy variables for these baseline methods. To ensure optimal
performance, we adhere to the official architecture settings for these methods and experiment with
learning rates of 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, and 0.00005. Each configuration is tested three times with
different initializations, and the best-performing setup is selected from all trials.

Our method.
When fine-tuning, we employ the LoRa [19] method to fine-tune the LLama 2 large
language model [55]. The rank in LoRa is set to either 8 or 16, depending on the required token
length to be processed. The alpha value in LoRa is set to 16, and the learning rate is set at 0.0001.
When formatting numeric tokens, we uniformly maintain three significant figures. Retaining more
significant figures offers minimal benefits and introduces an excessive number of tokens. The fine-
tuning is conducted on a single NVIDIA A100 40G GPU, with the large language model undergoing
several hundred to 1,000 training iterations on our curated data, requiring several hours.

Evaluation.
We choose five metrics to compare the prediction performances of different forecasting
models. Mean squared error (MSE) is used to verify outliers, focusing on larger prediction errors.
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures error magnitude by averaging squared errors and taking
the square root, aligning the error scale with the original data. Mean absolute error (MAE) is more
balanced for different magnitude errors. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) expresses the
error as a percentage of the actual values, that is, on average how far off the predictions are from
the actual values in percentage terms. The accuracy rate is defined as the proportion of true results
among the total number of cases examined. These metrics are calculated by:

MSE = 1

News Sources and Details

We analyzed the classical time series forecasting datasets, such as the Monash-TSF dataset, to identify
the specific time periods covered by the time series data. For the traffic domain, data from 2015
to 2016 was used. For the Bitcoin domain, data from 2019 to 2021 was utilized. Relevant news
information was filtered from the GDELT dataset using domain-specific keywords corresponding
to these periods. We conducted web crawling and intelligent parsing of the associated news web
pages. The traffic data was sourced from Yahoo, while the Bitcoin data was gathered from various
websites. Regular expressions were employed to extract essential information from the parsed
text, including news titles, URLs, publication dates, and the main content of the articles. From
the GDELT dataset, we initially filtered 14,543 traffic-related articles and 19,392 Bitcoin-related
articles. After removing invalid and redirected links, we retained 5,867 traffic articles and 5,906
Bitcoin articles. The traffic-related news data primarily covered the region of California, USA. The
extracted data was formatted into JSON files to facilitate seamless integration into our model training.

Figure 6: Word-Cloud of News Categories.

For the region-specific tasks, such as AU elec-
tricity demand and AU exchange rate, we col-
lected news articles spanning from 2015 to 2023
primarily sourced from news.com.au. In total,
we gathered 380,560 articles covering a diverse
range of topics pertinent to electricity demand
and exchange rates in Australia. The news arti-
cles were processed using a similar methodology
as described for the traffic and Bitcoin domains.
We performed web crawling and intelligent pars-
ing to extract key information from each article,
including titles, summaries, categories, URLs,
publication dates, and the full article contents.
Regular expressions were utilized to ensure the accurate extraction of essential data points. The struc-
tured data was then formatted into JSON files, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration into our
model training processes. By maintaining a consistent data collection and processing methodology
across different domains, we ensured the reliability and utility of the gathered information.

Random events are unpredictable and unplanned, such as natural disasters, accidents, health crises,
and criminal acts. Normal events are planned or anticipated based on patterns, like political activities,
sports & cultural events, economic reports, and public holidays. We used the LLM agent to categorize
and detect all random and normal events from our raw news dataset spanning January 1st to August
5th, 2019. The analysis revealed that, on average, 27.7% of all events are random. Figure 7 and
Figure 8 show the daily distribution of these random events. In our framework, the agent analyzes
and selects the most relevant news, which mainly consists of five categories: economic or political
events, health crises, natural disasters, technology development, and social sentiment. Additionally,
the reflection agent, which analyzes prediction errors in the training dataset and missed news, helps
identify unexpected and counterintuitive events buried in the raw news.

Table 6: We tested the effects of removing all or partial supplementary information, including Case 3, which
includes only Filtered News, and Case 4, which includes Filtered News and Partial Supplementary Information.
Removing all supplementary information and keeping only the news led to slight improvements compared to
using only Supplementary Information in a numerical/textual prompt. However, this approach did not perform as
well as Case 4. The results indicate that supplementary information remains essential. Overall, “Case 6: Textual
Prompt with Filtered News and all Supplementary Information” which includes all supplementary information
and filtered news, yields the best results.

Table 7: We tried other language models using our proposed method. Mistral v0.1 [22], a 7B model, produced
similar results as Llama 2 (7B). The Gemma 2B model [52] had slightly worse results, which may be due to its
limited number of parameters. It is necessary to adjust the training for small models to achieve better results.
Nonetheless, the results demonstrate the potential of language models to achieve good performance in our

More Results

Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15, and Figure 16 provide showcases of some forecasting tasks results.
It can be seen that our method has better results in predicting some sudden events and cases with
distribution changes. We also tested the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs on traditional time series
forecasting datasets. Given that long-term forecasting involves a significant number of digits and
long sequences occupy many input tokens, we selected the Ill dataset for testing our method, which
features prediction sequences of lengths 24, 36, 48, and 60. We also evaluated the performance of
univariate forecasts and trained univariate versions of other baseline methods for comparison. The
results, displayed in Table 9, show that, although counterintuitive, the fine-tuned LLMs can achieve
performance comparable to baseline methods, providing a solid foundation for our research. Table 6
shows additional comparison experiments of different types of data incorporation, and Table 7 shows
the comparison of using different pre-train language models.

Examples of Missed News Outputs

Answer: Examining the provided news on 2021-01-09 for potentially unconsidered factors in
the AUD/USD exchange rate prediction, one significant event stands out that could resonate
with economic implications, specifically concerning Australia as a significant commodity
exporter:

• Missed News Summary: "Brisbane’s streets have been empty in eerie scenes as the city
experiences its first day of lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus."
• Publication Time: 2021-01-09 12:59:00
• Category: Breaking News
• Possible Reasoning: This news shows a potential shift in economic activity due to new
COVID-19 lockdowns in a major Australian city, which could affect the AUD due to
changes in both domestic consumption and possibly a short-term impact on business
conditions. Lockdowns can create short-term economic disruptions influencing investor
sentiment and risk perception towards the AUD, potentially missed in the prediction model.
These items suggest an underestimation of contemporaneous socio-economic events that
might indirectly influence the AUD/USD exchange rate through shifts in economic expecta-
tions and risk sentiment related to the management of COVID-19, which would have been
highly relevant for predictions made for 2021-01-10.

Prompt 4:
According to <outlooked_news>, please directly conclude several new prediction logic
of the daily AUD exchange rate. (Remember not to output the detailed implementation plan)

Example Answers of News Reasoning Logic Updation

Answer:
1. Increased Risk Aversion: The lockdown in Brisbane may heighten risk aversion among
investors, leading to a potential decline in the AUD as investors flock to safe-haven
currencies like the USD. This can be anticipated as a prevalent reaction whenever there are
renewed concerns about COVID-19 impacts.
2. Domestic Consumption Impact: With the Brisbane lockdown, domestic consumption
could be considerably reduced. A decrease in consumer spending within Australia might
result in lower economic output forecasts, potentially weakening the AUD.
3. Market Sentiment and Speculation: News of the lockdown and its impact on one of
Australia’s significant cities can drive market sentiments and speculative trades, which
often have immediate effects on currency exchange rates. Negative news could prompt a
bearish sentiment towards the AUD.
4. Impact on Commodity Prices: As a major commodity exporter, any perceived slowdown
in Australia’s economy due to lockdowns can affect global commodity prices, influencing
the AUD. With a decrease in economic activities, demands for commodities might decline,
causing a domino effect on the currency.
5. Investor’s Perception of Economic Management: Prolonged or frequent lockdowns
might affect international perceptions of Australia’s management of economic challenges
during the pandemic. This perception can influence foreign direct investment flows and
currency strength.

Missed News Examples

By analyzing the relationship between prediction errors and news through the agent, we can identify
missing news (such as events with indirect impacts) and adjust the agent’s expectations of how news
events affect time series. For example, the agent might discover that a certain type of incident has a
relatively small impact on a specific region. These intelligent and flexible discoveries are detailed in
the missed news summary. Here are some examples of missed news during the iterative analysis:

1. Missed News: “ A coalition of 62 countries is backing Australia’s call for an inquiry into
the origins of the new coronavirus. It comes as Trade Minister Simon Birmingham’s
request for a meeting with China went unanswered.” Occurred at: 2020-05-16 21:15:00.
Possible reasoning: While the news about Australia pushing for an inquiry into COVID-
19’s origins and facing unresponsive behavior from China was considered, the geopolitical
tension this implies may have broader implications. This nature of international relations
potentially has consequences for the AUD, particularly in terms of trade volumes and
investor sentiment, given China’s role as a major trading partner. Given the prediction
results, this suggests that any immediate effect of this news on the exchange rate by the
prediction date (2020-05-17) was minimal or offset by other factors considered in the model.

2. Missed News: “Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, aims to achieve net zero car-
bon emissions by 2060, as stated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.” Occurred
at 2021-10-25 11:21:20. Possible Reasoning: Although this did not happen in Australia, a
deeper analysis of its impact on the AUD could enhance the prediction framework. This
shift towards sustainable energy from a major oil producer could influence global oil prices
and economic stability. As a significant exporter of commodities, Australia’s economy and
the AUD could be affected. The zero deviation between predicted and actual values suggests
either accurate forecasting by other models or a delayed effect on exchange rates. Further
analysis may be needed to understand the long-term impacts on currency values.

3. Missed news: “ US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the most vocal critics of Donald
Trump, has launched his presidential bid to a crowd of thousands of supporters.”
Occurred at 2019-03-03 04:30:00. The possible reasoning is that political announcements
in a country like the US can significantly impact global financial markets, including forex.
Bernie Sanders’s candidacy news could have influenced market speculation and investor
sentiment, affecting USD values and other major currencies. This detection suggests that
incorporating global political news from major economies like the US might enhance the
model’s predictive capabilities. Significant US political events, like presidential candidacies,
can influence global markets and forex currency fluctuations. Thus, overlooking major
political news can leave a model vulnerable to missing market reaction surprises.

(a) Australian Housing Market News: Missed News: "Despite economic uncertainty
throughout 2020, Australians confidently embraced the housing market pushing
sales volumes beyond even 2019 levels." Occurred at: "2021-01-17 10:00:00". Pos-
sible Reasoning: Although this news might seem domestically focused, the robust
activity in the housing market can reflect economic confidence and potentially boost
investor sentiment towards the AUD. Healthy real estate market metrics often attract
foreign investment and can have favorable ripple effects on currency strength.
(b) Australian Government Seeking Pfizer Vaccine Information: Missed News: "The
Australian government is seeking ’immediate’ advice and information after Nor-
way reported 29 deaths related to the Pfizer vaccine." Occurred at: "2021-01-17
10:10:00". Possible Reasoning: News related to vaccine concerns could create short-
term caution among investors, especially in contexts where the vaccine rollout impacts
economic recovery prospects. If international observers view the vaccine issues as
a slowdown to Australia’s reopening or economic normalization, it could temper
enthusiasm for the AUD.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the main contributions and scope of
the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper includes a separate "Limitations" section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

31


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results or proofs, focusing instead on
empirical and experimental contributions.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, experimental setups,
hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics, which are sufficient for reproducing the main
results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

32


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The authors have stated their commitment to releasing the code and model
upon acceptance, aligning with the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper thoroughly describes the training and testing details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper providing clear explanations of the statistical methods used to
compute metrics and ensuring the robustness of the reported findings.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

33


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research aligns with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper provides a balanced discussion of the potential societal impacts.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

34


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper ensures responsible usage and mitigating risks associated with
potential misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The paper credits the creators of any used assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

35


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper introduces new assets which are well documented alongside the
paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The research does not involve crowdsourcing or experiments with human
subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: As the study does not involve human subjects, IRB approvals or equivalent
reviews are not required.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you

guidelines for their institution.
