Abstract

Text-conditioned motion synthesis has made remarkable progress with the emer-
gence of diffusion models. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models
are primarily designed for a single character and overlook multi-human interactions.
In our approach, we strive to explore this problem by synthesizing human motion
with interactions for a group of characters of any size in a zero-shot manner. The
key aspect of our approach is the adaptation of human-wise interactions as pairs of
human joints that can be either in contact or separated by a desired distance. In
contrast to existing methods that necessitate training motion generation models on
multi-human motion datasets with a fixed number of characters, our approach inher-
ently possesses the flexibility to model human interactions involving an arbitrary
number of individuals, thereby transcending the limitations imposed by the training
data. We introduce a novel controllable motion generation method, InterControl,
to encourage the synthesized motions maintaining the desired distance between
joint pairs. It consists of a motion controller and an inverse kinematics guidance
module that realistically and accurately aligns the joints of synthesized characters
to the desired location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distance between
joint pairs for human-wise interactions can be generated using an off-the-shelf
Large Language Model (LLM). Experimental results highlight the capability of
our framework to generate interactions with multiple human characters and its
potential to work with off-the-shelf physics-based character simulators. Code is
available at https://github.com/zhenzhiwang/intercontrol.

Introduction

Generating realistic and diverse human motions is a vital task in computer vision, as it has diverse
applications in VR/AR, games, and films. In recent years, great progress has been achieved in
human motion generation by introducing VAE [31], Diffusion Model [23, 53] and large language
models [5]. These methods commonly investigated single-person motion generation given texts or
action classes [15, 14, 46, 71, 55, 6, 13, 45], part of motion [10, 19, 55], or other related modalities [35,
34, 56, 3, 18], yet overlooked multi-person interactions. By naively putting their generated single-
person motions in a shared global space, such motions could easily penetrate each other. They cannot
even perform simple interactions like handshaking due to lack of the ability to control two people’s
hands to reach the same location at the same time. Many multi-person datasets [1, 16, 42, 59] lacks
text annotations and focus on motion completion given prefix motions. Recently, InterGen [36]
collected a two-person interaction generation dataset, and let model to learn two-person motions
from data. It is limited by the fixed number of characters and cannot generalize to arbitrary numbers.
Previous methods commonly ignore a good design for general interaction modeling.

Figure 1: InterControl is able to generate interactions of a group of people given joint-joint contact
or separation pairs as spatial condition, and it is only trained on single-person data. Our generated
interactions are realistic and similar to real interactions in internet images in (a) daily life and (b)
fighting. (c) shows our generated group motions (red dots) could serve as reference motions for
physics animation.

This paper investigates a special yet widely used form of human interactions: interactions that could
be quantitatively described by spatial relations of human joints, such as distances or orientations, as
shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). Such interactions are conceptually simple, as their semantics are almost
from spatial relations. Thus, they do not require additional interaction data. It only needs pretrained
models from single-person data and could be generalized to an arbitrary number of humans. We
define human interactions as steps of joint-joint contact pairs and devise a single-person motion
generation model to take such contact pairs as control signals. Besides, orientations could also be
used in control, such as making two people face each other. In this way, interaction generation is
transformed to controllable motion generation. Inspired by [64], we adapt descriptions of interactions
as joint contact pairs by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Thus, human interactions are
annotation-free, and interactions could also involve multiple human joints.

As interactions are adapted to our defined joint contact pairs, the key challenge to generate interactions
is the precise spatial control to satisfy the constraint of spatial controls. This difficulty lies in two parts:
(1) the discrepancy between control signals in global space and relative motion representation in
mainstream pretrained models [14, 55]: As semantics of motions are independent to global locations,
previous works [14, 55] commonly utilize the relative motions, where global locations could only
be inferred by aggregating velocities. It poses challenges to control local human poses with global
conditions. Previous attempts [55, 51] exploit the inpainting ability of a pretrained model, yet they
are unable to control global joints. GMD [27] proposes a two-stage model of separated root trajectory
generation and local pose generation. Although it manages to control root positions, controlling every
joint at any time is still infeasible. (2) the sparse control signals in the motion sequence: Control
signals could be sparse in both temporal and joint dimension, model needs to adaptively adjust
trajectories in uncontrolled frames to satisfy the intermittent constraints.

In this paper, we propose InterControl, a novel human interaction generation method that is able to
precisely control the position of any joint at any time for any person, and it is only trained on single-
person motion data. By adding spatial controls to MDM [55], InterControl is a unified framework
of two types of spatial control modules: (1) Motion ControlNet inspired by ControlNet [70]: It is
initialized from a pretrained MDM [55] and takes global spatial locations as input for joint control
in the global space. It is able to generate coherent and high-fidelity motions yet joint positions in
global space are not perfect. (2) Inverse Kinematics (IK) Guidance for joint locations: To further
align generated motions and spatial conditions precisely, we use inverse kinematics (IK) [44] to
guide the denoising steps towards desired positions. It could be regarded as a classifier guidance [9],

---Page Break---
yet it has no extra classifiers. We utilize L-BFGS [37] as the optimizer to directly align the global
conditions in the local space. With two proposed modules, InterControl is able to control multiple
joints of any person at any time. Furthermore, InterControl is able to jointly optimize multiple types
of spatial controls, such as orientation alignment, collision avoidance, and joint contacts, as long
as the distance measures in IK guidance are differentiable. By exploiting its joint control ability,
our model is able to generate multi-person interactions with rich contacts, where no multi-person
interaction datasets are needed. Our generated interactions could further serve as the reference motion
to generate physical animation with meaningful human-wise reactions in simulators. As shown in
Fig. 1 (c), one character could actually hit down the other with his fists by taking our generated
fighting motions as input. Extensive experiments in HumanML3D [14] and KIT-ML [47] datasets
quantitatively validates our joint control ability, and the user study on generated interactions shows a
clear preference over previous methods.

To summarize, our contributions are twofold: (1) We are the first to generate multi-person interactions
with a single-person motion generation model in a zero-shot manner. (2) We are the first to perform
precise spatial control of every joint in every person at any time for interaction generation.

Related Work

2.1
Human Motion Generation

Synthesizing human motions is a long-standing topic. Previous efforts integrate extensive multimodal
data as condition to facilitate conditional human motion generation, including text [15, 14, 46, 71,
55, 6, 30], action label [13, 45], part of motion [10, 19, 55], music [35, 34, 56], speech [3, 18] and
trajectory [49, 27, 28]. As texts are free-form information that convey rich semantics, recent progress
in motion generation are mainly based on text conditions. For example, FLAME [30] introduces
transformer [58] to process variable-length motion data and language description. MDM [55] intro-
duces the diffusion model and uses classifier-free guidance for text-conditioned motion generation.
MLD [6] further incorporates a VAE [31] to encode motions into vectors and makes the diffusion
process in the latent space. Physdiff [68] integrates physical simulators as constraints in the diffusion
process to make the generated motion physically plausible and reduce artifacts. PriorMDM [51] treats
pretrained MDM [55] as a generative prior and controls MDM by motion inpainting. Our InterControl
also use a pretrained MDM, yet we further train a Motion ControlNet instead of using inpainting.
A concurrent work OmniControl [65] also incorporate classifier guidance [9] and controlnet [70]
modules to control all joints in MDM, yet it focuses on single-person motion generation and does not
investigate human interaction generation.

2.2
Human-related Interaction Generation.

As human motions could be affected or interacted by surrounding humans [72, 29, 57], objects [66,
54, 12, 33, 26] and scenes [62–64, 73, 20, 61], generating interactions is also an important topic.
Previous methods are mainly about human-scene/object interaction. For example, Interdiff [66] uses
the contact point of human joints and objects as the root to generate object motions. UniHSI [64]
exploits LLM to generate contact steps between human joints and scene parts as an action plan and
control the agent perform the plan via reinforcement learning. As previous human-human interactions
datasets [42, 59] only contains very few multi-person sequences, previous human-human interaction
methods [60, 67] are mainly limited to unsupervised motion completion without texts. Recently,
InterHuman dataset [36] is proposed for text-conditioned multi-person interaction generation, yet it
only consider the two-person situation and is not able to model more people’s interaction. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to enable a single-person text-conditioned motion generation
model to perform interactions between a group of people by controlling diverse joints of each person.

2.3
Controllable Diffusion Models

Diffusion-based generative models have achieved great progress in generating various modalities,
such as image [50, 22, 9, 53], video [11, 17, 24] and audio [32]. Conditions and controlling ability in
diffusion models are also well studied: (1) Inpainting-based methods [8, 7] predict part of the data
with the observed parts as condition and rely on diffusion model to generate consistent output, which
is used in PriorMDM [51]. (2) Classifier-guidance [9] trains a separate classifier and exploits the

3


---Page Break---
gradient of classifier to guide the diffusion process. Our InterControl inherits the spirit of classifier-
guidance, yet our guidance is provided by Inverse Kinematics (IK) and no classifier is needed. (3)
Classifier-free guidance [22] trains a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model simultaneously
and trade-off its quality and diversity by setting weights. (4) ControlNet [70] introduces a trainable
copy of pretrained diffusion model to process the condition and freezes the original model to avoid
degeneration of generation ability. It enables diverse types of dense control signals for various
purpose with minimal finetuning effort. Our InterControl also incorporate the idea of ControlNet [70]
to finetune the pretrained MDM [55] to process spatial control signals and improve the quality of
generated motions after joint control.

InterControl

InterControl aims to generate interactions with only single-person motion data by precisely controlling
every joint of every person at any time, conditioned on text prompts and joint relations. We first
formulate interaction generation in Sec. 3.1, and then introduce control modules for a single-person
motion diffusion model in Sec. 3.3 and Sec. 3.4. Finally we show details to generate interactions
from our model in Sec. 3.5.

3.1
Formulation of Interaction Generation

Inspired by human-scene interaction [64], we define human interactions as joint contact pairs
C = {S1, S2, . . .}, where Si is the ith contact step. Taking two-person interaction as an example, each
step S has several contact pairs S =

j1
1, j2
1, ts
1, te
1, c1, d1
	
,

j1
2, j2
2, ts
2, te
2, c2, d2
	
, . . .
	
, where j1
k
is the joint of person 1, j2
k is the joint of person 2, ts
k and te
k means the start and end frame of the
interaction, ck means contact type from {contact, avoid} to pull or push the joint pairs, dk is the
desired distance in the interaction. By converting the contact pairs S to the mask m and distance d,
and taking others’ joint positions as condition, we could guide the multi-person motion generation
process to interact between joints in the form of spatial distance. In this way, interaction generation is
transformed to be controllable single-person motion generation taking a text prompt p and a spatial
control signal c ∈RN×J×3 as input. Its goal is to predict motion sequence x ∈RN×D whose joints
in the global space is aligned with spatial control c, where N is number of frames, J is number of
joints (e.g., 24 in SMPL [38]), and D is the dimension of relative joint representations (e.g., 263 in
HumanML3D [14]). Incorporating spatial control in motion generation presents challenges due to
the discrepancy between relative motion representation x and global c.

3.2
Human Motion Diffusion Model (MDM)

Relative Motion Representation. HumanML3D [14] dataset proposes a widely-used [55, 68, 51, 6]
relative motion representation, and is proved to be easier to learn realistic motions, as the semantics
of human motion is independent of global positions. It consists of root joint velocity, other joints’
positions, velocities and rotations in the root space, and foot contact labels. To convert it to the
global space, root velocities are aggregated, then other joints will be computed based on root. Please
refer to Sec. 5 of HumanML3D [14] for details. Due to such discrepancy, previous inpainting-based
methods [55, 51] is not able to control MDM in global space. GMD [27] decouples motion generation
to two separated generation process of root trajectory and pose relative to root, yet it can only control
root joint. Directly adopting global joint positions to generate motions yields unnatural human poses,
such as unrealistic limb lengths.

Diffusion Process in MDM. Motivated by the success of image diffusion models [22, 50, 70, 9, 53],
Motion Diffusion Model (MDM) [55] is proposed to synthesize sequence-level human motions
conditioned on texts p via classifier-free guidance [22]. The diffusion process is modeled as a
noising Markov process q (xt | xt−1) = N
 √αtxt−1, (1 −αt) I

, where αt ∈(0, 1) are small
constant hyper-parameters, thus xT ∼N(0, I) if αt is small enough. Here xt ∈RN×D is the entire
motion sequence at denoising time-step t, and there are T time-steps in total. Thus, x0 is the clean
motion sequence, and xT is a random noise to be sampled. The denoising Markov process is defined
as pθ (xt−1 | xt, p) = N (µθ(xt, t, p), (1 −αt) I) , where µθ(xt, t, p) is the estimated posterior
mean for the t−1 step from a neural network based on the input xt and θ is its parameters. Following
MDM, we predict the clean motion x0(xt, t, p; θ) instead of the noise ϵ via a transformer [58], and
the posterior mean µθ(xt, t, p) is

3.3
Motion ControlNet for MDM

As MDM is initially conditioned on texts p, it requires fine-tuning to accommodate spatial conditions
c. This is challenging due to the potential sparsity of c across temporal and joint dimensions: (1)
Control may be required for only a few joints, necessitating adaptive adjustment of the remaining
joints to preserve realistic motion. (2) Control may be desired for only a select few frames, thus the
model must interpolate natural human motions for the rest of the sequence.

Inspired by ControlNet [70], we introduce Motion ControlNet to generate realistic and high-fidelity
motions guided by condition c. It is a trainable copy of MDM, while MDM is frozen in our training
process. Each transformer encoder layer in ControlNet is connected to its MDM counterpart via a
zero-initialized linear layer. This allows InterControl to commence training from a state equivalent
to a pretrained MDM, acquiring a residual feature for c in each layer through back-propagation. To
process c, the uncontrolled joints, frames, and XYZ-dim are masked as 0. We find that the vanilla
c ∈RN×3J is effective enough to control the pelvis (root) joint, yet it is still sub-optimal for other
joints. Thus, we design a relative condition indicating the distance from the current positions of
each joint to c. Suppose R(·) is a forward kinematics (FK) to convert relative motion x ∈RN×D
to global space R(x) ∈RN×J×3, the relative condition is c′ = c −R(x). To provide additional
clues, we also use c′′ = c −R(x)root to represent the distance from the current root to the desired
position. We also use the normal of triangles (pelvis, left/right shoulder) ns and (pelvis, left/right
hip) nh to represent the current orientation of human. The final condition passed to ControlNet is
cfinal = (c′||c′′||ns||nh), where || is concatenation. Please refer to Appendix A.2 for more details.

Network Training. Motion ControlNet is the only part that needs finetuning in our framework,
while IK guidance is an optimization method in the test time and the LLM in our framework is an
off-the-shelf GPT-4 [43]. We adopt the standard ControlNet [70] training strategy, and the only
difference is the data format: we first convert the relative motion to be global locations by FK, and
then use random masks that keeps part of global joints to be non-zero as spatial control signals. The
training objective is identical to MDM. The spatial conditions are randomly sampled in the temporal
or joint dimension. The training data is single-person data only, e.g., HumanML3D [14].

3.4
Inverse Kinematics (IK) Guidance

While Motion ControlNet can adapt joint positions according to sparse conditions, the alignment
between predicted poses and global spatial conditions often lacks precision. As Inverse Kinematics
(IK) is a classic method for optimizing joint rotations to achieve specific global positions, we employ
it to guide the diffusion process towards spatial conditions at test time in a classifier guidance [9]
manner, named IK guidance.

IK Guidance on general form of losses. Inspired by classifier guidance [9] and loss-guided dif-
fusion [52], we employ losses in the global space to steer the denoising process. IK guidance
accommodates various forms of distance measurements, enabling both minimization and maximiza-
tion for flexible control over joint interactions, such as attraction or repulsion. Given the global
position c ∈RN×J×3, the distance between a joint and condition is dnj = ∥cnj −R(µt)nj∥2,
where µt is short for µθ(xt, t, p) mentioned in Sec. 3.2, and R(·) is forward kinematics (FK).
To allow the interaction of joints with some given distances d′ ∈RN×J×3, loss of one joint is
lnj = ReLU
 
dnj −d′
nj

to make the joint and condition be contacted within distance d′
nj; and it is
lnj = ReLU
 
d′
nj −dnj

to make the joint and condition be far away, where ReLU is a function to
keep values ≥0 and set values ≤0 to 0. Finally, with a binary mask m ∈{0, 1}N×J×3, the total
loss for all joints and frames is

L(µt, c) =

P

n
P

j mnj · lnj
P

n
P

j mnj
,
(2)

As ℓ2-loss and FK are highly differentiable, we optimize L(µt, c) in Equ. 2 w.r.t µt using the second-
order optimizer L-BFGS [37], which is commonly used in Inverse Kinematics, rather than first-order
gradient methods. Classifier guidance [9] utilizes a pre-trained image classifier to direct the diffusion
towards a target image class by the gradient ∇xt log fϕ (y | xt), where fϕ is the classifier, y is image
class. Unlike this method, we do not rely on a large neural network classifier. L-BFGS has been
demonstrated to better align global positions and offer quicker convergence than first-order methods.
We update the posterior mean µt using L-BFGS for k iterations at each denoising step, where k is a
hyper-parameter. This optimization facilitates both pull and push types of IK guidance, corresponding
to two contact types in our interaction model. To maintain consistency in data distribution between
training and inference, we also apply IK guidance when training ControlNet. Additionally, employing
IK guidance on x0 eliminates the need for training Motion ControlNet, thus enhancing training
efficiency. In practice, using L-BFGS on both x0 and µt can yield satisfactory joint and spatial
condition alignment. Detailed algorithm for interaction generation is presented in Appendix A.1.

As the root position at frame n is derived from cumulative root velocities up to frame n in FK, a
single condition at frame n can influence all preceding root positions. This effect also extends to
non-root joints, as their global positions are calculated from the root. Consequently, IK guidance can
adaptively modify velocities from the start to frame n to meet the condition at frame n. Moreover, IK
guidance can control any combination of human joints, frames or XYZ-dims, such as controlling the
left hand and right foot at a specific frame n.

3.5
Interaction Generation

Inverse Kinematics (IK) guidance can optimize various distance measures to facilitate interactions
such as avoiding obstacles, preventing collisions, facilitating face-to-face engagements, or enabling
joint contacts between individuals. This method allows for intricate interactions among any human
joints for an indefinite number of people, despite being trained exclusively on single-person data. As
delineated in Section 3.1, we characterize interactions as pairs of contacting joints. A notable feature
of our IK guidance in generating interactions is that both terms of the IK guidance loss function are
predicted, allowing for simultaneous optimization within a single process. Specifically, the single-
person loss Lsingle(µt, c) transforms into Lmulti(µa
t , µb
t) for interactions, where a and b represent
two individuals. The L-BFGS optimizer concurrently optimizes both participants by minimizing
Lmulti(µa
t , µb
t), with µa
t and µb
t being the respective joints engaged in interaction. Beyond distance
measures, our IK guidance can optimize orientation measures as well. For example, one can calculate
a person’s orientation through the spatial relationship of their joints, like the cross-product of vectors
from the left shoulder to the right and from the pelvis to the head. By setting two individuals’ unit
orientation vectors to 0, they can face each other or turn away. To ensure they face each other, we can
further adjust the relation between one person’s orientation vector and the vector from their head to

6


---Page Break---
the other’s. Such orientation relationships are vital for producing realistic interactions when we only
exploit single-person motion generation ability and can be easily expanded to include larger groups.
Another useful strategy in IK guidance is to prevent collision through joint separation pairs, ensuring
that the torso joints of two people (such as pelvis, hips, and spines) maintain a certain distance,
thereby reducing the likelihood of collisions when other joints are in contact. Besides, we can also
regulate the motion region by confining the root joints within the XZ-plane using IK guidance. For
the PyTorch-like code illustrating loss functions that enforce joint contacts, separations, or orientation
alignment, please refer to Appendix A.1 for details.

In our framework, interaction generation is realized by using joint-joint contact pairs as control
signals. These pairs can be manually crafted by users to create desired interactions, akin to utilizing
ControlNet [70] in image generation. However, manually constructing joint contact pairs can be
tedious, so we employ an automatic off-the-shelf GPT-4 [43] as a planner. GPT-4 infers text prompts
that describe the actions of multiple people, pmulti, and converts them into single-person prompts,
p, and contact plans, C, through prompt engineering. The inputs for the LLM Planner include the
multi-person sentences pmulti, background scenario details B, human joint data J , and predefined
instructions, rules, and examples. Specifically, B encompasses the number of individuals, total motion
sequence frames, and video playback speed; J contains names of all joints (for example, the 22 joint
names in HumanML3D [14]); and the rules outline the joint contact pair format and guide the LLM
to generate feasible contacts and timesteps. Our method leverages the pre-trained capabilities of
GPT-4 to comprehend human joint relationships from interaction descriptions via prompt engineering
without any fine-tuning. Thus, the inference process of our model is not related to LLMs, making
our comparison with other methods be fair. Please refer to Appendix A.3 for details of prompts and
contact plans.

Experiments

Datasets. We conduct experiments on HumanML3D [14] and KIT-ML [47] following MDM [55].
HumanML3D contains 14,646 high-quality human motion sequences from AMASS [41] and Hu-
manAct12 [13], while KIT-ML contains 3,911 motion sequences with more noises.

Evaluation Protocol. We adopt metrics suggested by Guo et. al. [14] to evaluate the quality of
alignment between text and motion, which are Frechet Inception Distance (FID), R-Precision, and
Diversity. We also report metrics related to spatial controls following GMD [27] on HumanML3D
dataset, which are Foot skating ratio, Trajectory error, Location error and Average error. Please
refer to Appendix B.5 or papers [14, 27] for more details.

Due to the page limit, we put the implementation details and text-to-motion generation in the
Appendix B.1 and B.2.

4.1
Single-Person Controllable Motion Generation

In Tab. 1, we compare InterControl with other spatially controllable methods [51, 27, 65]. We also
include results of MDM [55] to show the controlling metrics [27] without spatial control.MDM’s
trajectory can significantly deviate from the intended path in the absence of control signals, with an
average error often exceeding 1m. In contrast, inpainting-based control, unaware of global spatial
information, results in considerable divergence, as seen with PriorMDM [51]. GMD [27] decouples
this problem and generates root trajectories in the global space, so it achieves better performance in
spatial control metrics. However, its limitation to only the root joint constrains its spatial control and
interaction capabilities. Our InterControl could achieve very small errors in spatial control metrics
for all-joint control thanks to the power of Inverse Kinematics and L-BFGS optimizer. Meanwhile,
Motion ControlNet could ensure the motion data is still in the same distribution with the training set
by adapting to the posterior mean updated by IK guidance in its training stage, leading to even better
FID than previous methods. It is worth noting that we only use a single model to learn the control
strategy for all joints, while previous method [51] needs to train separate models and blend them for
multiple joints. Our method achieves similar performance with controlling one joint when extending
it to control multiple joints (last two rows in Tab. 1). Compared to the recent concurrent work [65],
we achieve significantly better FID and Traj./Loc. errors than it in both root joint control or random
joint control. It [65] also shows a notable gap between two form of joint controls (0.310 vs. 0.218),
while our method is more robust to joint variants (0.178 vs. 0.159) thanks to our special designs

of more inputs in Motion ControlNet. Its R-precision and foot-skating ratio are slightly better than
ours, we believe the reason is that their 1-st order optimization tolerates more errors when the joint
alignment is hard. It is also supported by their worse Traj./Loc. yet better Avg. err., i.e., their method
shows more outliers with large errors. However, their design need much more times of optimization
compared to ours (e.g., 100 vs. 5) and leads to longer inference time than ours (120s vs. 80s).

4.2
Zero-Shot Multi-Person Interaction Generation

To validate our model’s interaction generation ability, we analyze the spatial control results in interac-
tion scenarios and perform an user study to qualitatively compare our model with PriorMDM [51].
We also introduce an potential application of our interaction generation method for physics animation.

Spatial Control. In Tab. 2 (left), we compare spatial-related metrics with PriorMDM in zero-
shot human interaction generation. Specifically, we collect 100 descriptions of two-person actions
from InterHuman Dataset [36] and let an off-the-shelf GPT-4 [43] to adapt them to single-person
motion descriptions and joint-joint contact pairs via prompt engineering (see Tab. 7 in Appendix).
Then, we utilize an InterControl model pretrained on the HumanML3D dataset to generate human
interactions conditioned on text prompts and joint contact pairs. The spatial-related metrics are
reported over controlled joints and frames. InterControl achieves good performance of spatial errors
in interaction scenarios, indicating its robustness in precise spatial control for multiple humans. In
contrast, PriorMDM [51] could only take interaction descriptions as input and unable to perform
spatial control, leading to much larger spatial errors.

User Study. We conduct a user study to qualitatively compare our method with PriorMDM on
the text-conditioned two-person interaction generation. 134 unique users were participating in
the user study, where each user will answer 19 single choice questions to compare our results
with PriorMDM [51]. Results in Tab. 2 (right) shows that our generated interactions are clearly
preferred over PriorMDM by a percent of 81.2%. We also shows an example sequence of qualitative
comparison with PriorMDM [51] in the user study in Fig. 3. PriorMDM [51] shows severe torso
collision between two human skeletons and the generated two-people motion is not aligned with
the interaction description, while our model has no torso collision thanks to the collision avoidance
loss in our IK guidance. Besides, our method also produces reasonable kicking actions between two
people according to the semantics of interaction description. Please refer to Appendix B.4 for details.
Qualitative results: Although our model is only trained on single-person data, it is still possible to
generate interactions between an arbitrary number of people via our designed format of interaction.
In Fig. 4, we show two representative results of zero-shot interaction generation. (1) Two-person
dancing: In addition to the single person dancing from the pretrained ability of single-person model,
we further let them hold hands from time to time and prevent them from collision between their
torsos. To further make their dance natural, we also employ a loss to promote their orientations to

be face-to-face. (2) Three-person fighting: In addition to a single person performing punching and
kicking, we further let them punch or kick others’ head and torso, and also prevent their torsos from
collision. Compared to existing interaction generation method [36], our method is able to generate
interaction between any number of people, while InterGen [36] is only able to generate two-person
interaction. Besides, our method is the first method to leverage single-person motion generation
model to generate human interactions in a zero-shot manner.

Application: Our method is able to seamlessly integrate with off-the-shelf character simulation
approaches, allowing us to synthesize physically plausible human reactions. As shown in Fig. 1 (c),
our method synthesizes the motions, where the orange character is fighting with other two characters,
as the reference of the SoTA physics-aware motion imitator [40]. The interactions of our motions are
designed to hit heads of other characters with fists. Leveraging the precise spatial control provided
by our approach, the animated characters in the simulator can accurately respond to these impacts,
resulting in realistic reactions such as being knocked down. This capability to generate spatially
coherent multi-human interactions enables our method to improve the plausibility and responsiveness
of synthesized reactions within physics-based character animations.

4.3
Ablation Studies

To further investigate the effectiveness of InterControl, we ablate our method in Tab. 3 and reveal
some key information in controlling the motion generation model in the global space. Then we also
analyze the computational costs of our method to ensure our control is efficient. We will refer to
the variants of InterControl by row numbers in Tab. 3. All experiments are trained on all joints and
evaluated with randomly selected joints to report average performance.

Motion ControlNet. By dropping ControlNet, we find that IK guidance could still follow spatial
controls with very low errors, yet the motion quality (e.g., FID) is significantly damaged (row 1 vs.
row 2). Our ControlNet could adapt to the posterior distribution updated by IK guidance, and produce
high-quality motion data. We also find that our cfinal provides key information in controlling all
joints: For root control only, the FID of cfinal and c shows small difference. However, the FID
of root control is always slightly better than all-joint control (∼0.07) when we use c, indicating
insufficient information in all-joint control. We alleviate this by introducing extra information in
cfinal for Motion ControlNet and improve the FID of all-joint control from 0.227 (row 3) to 0.178
(row 1).

IK guidance. By dropping IK guidance, Motion ControlNet can produce good semantic-level metrics
(e.g., FID) compared with MDM by using extra spatial cues (row 4). However, this variant will lead
to more spatial errors and cannot strictly follow spatial controls in global space. As precise joint
alignment is vital for interactions, IK guidance is important for our InterControl. Another variant is

updating IK guidance on ControlNet’s prediction x0 (row 5), instead of the posterior mean µt. Its
advantage is faster training speed because IK guidance is no longer needed in training ControlNet
(similar to classifier guidance [9]) yet it leads to slightly worse FID than using µt. We believe the
reason is that IK guidance still changes the data distribution in denoising steps even if it is updated on
x0. Finally, we also report the result of 1-st order gradient in classifier guidance [9] (row 6) instead
of L-BFGS. We find it takes more computations to achieve similar performance with L-BFGS, which
is analyzed below.

Inference time analysis. In practice, we find that IK guidance in last few denoising steps (e.g.,
t ∈[0, 9]) is vital for precise joint control, while most denoising steps t ∈[10, 999] are less important
yet take most of computations. IK guidance on x0 with only once L-BFGS in t ∈[10, 999] and
10 times in t ∈[0, 9] could leads FID 0.234 in controlling all joints, yet leads to minimal extra
computations. We report its total inference time of 1000 denoising steps by adding sub-modules
step-by-step in Tab. 4. GMD [27] needs 110s to run two-stage diffusion models, while we only needs
80s. Gradient-based optimization in the recent work [65] needs 120s to achieve similar control quality.
Leveraging GPU parallel computing capabilities, InterControl can efficiently generate motions for a
batch of 32 people in 91 seconds, enabling efficient group motion generation.

Sparse control signals in temporal. As a key challenge of spatial control is the sparsity, we also
report results with sparsely selected frames as control (sparsity = 0.25 and 0.025) in Tab. 3 (row 7 and
8). Our model demonstrates consistent performance in both spatial error and semantic-level metrics
when using sparse signals, e.g., FID 0.255 and avg. err. 0.0467 with sparsity 0.025, while GMD [27]
achieves FID 0.523 and avg. err. 0.139 with the same sparsity.

Conclusion and Limitations

We presented InterControl, a multi-person interaction generation method that is only trained on
single-person motion data. It could generate interactive human motions of an arbitrary number of
people. We achieve this by enabling a text-conditioned motion generation model with the ability to
control every joint of every person at any time. We propose two complementary modules, named
Motion ControlNet and IK guidance, to improve both the spatial alignment between joints and
desired positions, and the overall quality of whole motions. Extensive experiments are conducted on
HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
modules. We enable InterControl the ability of text-conditioned interaction generation by leveraging
the knowledge of LLMs. Qualitative results and user study validate that InterControl could generate
high-quality interactions by precise spatial joint control.

Limitations. As InterControl is not trained on multi-person data, its definition of interaction is
based on distances (being contacted or separated) or orientations. Its motion quality is from motion
generation model trained on single-person motion data, and the plausibility of interactions is from
the knowledge of LLMs, i.e., to what extent the joint contact pairs are consistent to the semantics
of interaction descriptions. Yet, InterControl could generate interactions of an arbitrary number of
people, while all existing interaction generation methods cannot.

A.1
Pseudo-code of IK guidance

Here we elaborate the details of IK guidance’s algorithm. As we mentioned in the main paper, IK
guidance could be performed on predicted clean motion (i.e., x0) or posterior mean in denoising step
t (i.e., µt). In practice, we find that x0 works well in root control, and it does not require IK guidance
in training Motion ControlNet, leading to faster training speed. Besides, it also requires less times of
L-BFGS [37], which means faster inference speed. µt leads to better FID in controlling all joints, yet
it requires more times of L-BFGS [37] and also need IK guidance in training Motion ControlNet. We
show the pseudo-code of InterControl in interaction generation in Algorithm 1.

A.2
Details of Motion ControlNet

In this subsection, we elaborate the details of Motion ControlNet’s architecture. Motion ControlNet is
designed to adaptively generate realistic and high-fidelity motion sequences based on condition c. It
is a trainable copy of MDM, and each transformer encoder layer of ControlNet and the original MDM
is connected by a zero-initialized linear layer, as shown in Fig. 5. The parameters in the original
MDM is pretrained and frozen in the entire training process. Thus, our framework in the finetuning
process starts from the weights that is equivalent to a pretrained MDM due to the zero-initialized
linear layers. ControlNet will learn a residual feature for spatial control signals c in each transformer
layer by the back-propagated gradients. Thus, our model is able to implicitly adjust model weights
for all joints and frames based on a sparse spatial condition c by learning the spatial-level conditional
distribution in addition to the semantic-level distribution.

To process condition c, the uncontrolled joints, frames and XYZ-dim are masked as 0. Then we use a
linear layer to project the condition c ∈RN×3J to the hidden dimension of transformer layers as
cH ∈RN×DH, and feed c′ to transformer encoder layers in ControlNet. We use a zero-initialized
linear layer to link the output of each layer in ControlNet to the transformer encoder layer of pretrained
and frozen MDM via a residual connection [21]. We use extra information as condition for Motion

A.3
LLM-Planner

In this section, we further elaborate the details of LLM Planner. Specifically, we collect 100 sentences
describing human interactions with joint contacts from the description of InterHuman Dataset [36].
Then, we use a GPT-4 [43] with the prompt in Tab. 7 to let GPT-4 to produce joint-joint contact plans
for us. For each collected sentence, we replace it as the instruction in the prompt, and LLM will
generate 10 task plans for us, as shown in Tab. 8. We manually correct typos of task plans generated
by LLM, such as typos of joint name, invalid joint name, or invalid start frame or end frame. It leads
to 989 valid task plans. Finally, we write Python scripts to transform the natural language tasks plans
to Python Json format, as shown in Tab. 9. We take single-person language prompts in task plans as
texts for motion diffusion model, and transform information in ’steps’ to joint contact masks in the
spatial condition. Specifically, we update the other person’s joint positions as the current person’s
spatial condition in each denoising step, and use the spatial condition to guide Motion ControlNet and
IK guidance in the same way with single-person scenarios. We evaluate the quality of interactions by
using metrics like trajectory error and average error proposed by GMD [27] in the same way with
single-person scenarios. We only evaluate on joints and frames in the joint-joint contact pairs. The
result on our collected 989 task plans is shown in Tab. 5 in the main paper.

Implementation Details.

We initialize parameters of both original MDM and Motion ControlNet from pretrained MDM [55]
weight and freeze the parameters of original MDM during training. Following MDM [55], we use
CLIP [48] model to encode text prompts. We run L-BFGS [37] in IK guidance 5 times for the first
990 denoising steps and 10 times for the last 10 denoising steps on the posterior mean µt; and once
for the first 990 steps and 10 times for the last 10 steps on clean motion x0. We use IK guidance in
training ControlNet when using it on µt. We set two types of mask m ∈{0, 1}N×J×3: (1) Only
keeps pelvis (root) joint for root control to fairly compare with previous methods; (2) Randomly keep
one joint in each iteration to learn to control all joints for interaction generation. Each type of mask
will be used in both training and inference for consistency. Thus, we get two model weights, where
(1) could be fairly compared with previous methods and we use (2) for interaction generation. We
use AdamW [39] optimizer and set the learning rate as 1e-5.

To generally compare our InterControl with previous text-conditioned motion generation methods,
we report the alignment quality of text and generated motions suggested by Guo et. al. [14] in Tab. 5.

Table 6: Spatial control results on the HumanML3D [14] dataset. Ours (all) means the model is
trained on one randomly selected joint among all joints in each iteration.

Note that methods in the upper part of both tables are unable to perform spatial control, thus they
are incapable of generating controllable motions and interactions even if they have lower FID or
higher R-precision. For instance, T2M-GPT [69] and MotionGPT [25] tokenize human poses to
discrete tokens and is unable to incorporate any spatial information. MLD [6] uses latent diffusion to
accelerate denoising steps, yet performing spatial control needs to convert each step of latent feature
back to motion representations. It leads to much more computation than MDM [55] and is opposite
to MLD’s motivation of latent diffusion. Among methods that are suitable for spatial control [51, 27]
in Tab. 5, InterControl achieves the best performance in most of semantic-level metrics, and is better
than the recent work OmniControl [65] that focuses on single-person motion yet shares similar design
of spatial controlling with us.

B.3
More Single-joint Control Results

In Tab. 1 of our main paper, we have shown the spatial control results with root joint and randomly
selected one/two/three joints. Following the recent work [65], we also show the spatial control
performance on specific joints in Tab. 6. We find that feet and hands are more difficult to control due
to their flexibility, while root (pelvis) and head are more easier to follow, leading to better FID and
R-precision.

B.4
Details of User Study

In the user study, our method generates 50 samples from the contact plans collected from LLM-
planner. We also use the original interaction description to generate two-person interactions from
ComMDM in PriorMDM [51]. In Fig. 6, we show our designed questionnaire’s evaluation instructions
and the first question as an example. Each questionnaire has 19 single choice questions randomly
sampled from all samples. In the folder named ‘user-study-videos’, we provide 25 videos sampled
from our Intercontrol and PriorMDM for reference.

B.5
Details of Evaluation Metrics

Here we select some descriptions for metrics used to evaluate controllable motion generation methods
from HumanML3D [14] and GMD [27] to save reader’s time.

Semantic-level Evaluation Metrics from HumanML3D [14]: Frechet Inception Distance (FID),
diversity and multi-modality. For quantitative evaluation, a motion feature extractor and text feature
extractor is trained under contrastive loss to produce geometrically close feature vectors for matched
text-motion pairs, and vice versa. Further explanations of aforementioned metrics as well as the
specific textual and motion feature extractor are relegated to the supplementary file due to space limit.
In addition, the R-precision and MultiModal distance are proposed in this work as complementary
metrics, as follows. Consider R-precision: for each generated motion, its ground-truth text description
and 31 randomly selected mismatched descriptions from the test set form a description pool. This
is followed by calculating and ranking the Euclidean distances between the motion feature and the
text feature of each description in the pool. We then count the average accuracy at top-1, top-2
and top-3 places. The ground truth entry falling into the top-k candidates is treated as successful
retrieval, otherwise it fails. Meanwhile, MultiModal distance is computed as the average Euclidean
distance between the motion feature of each generated motion and the text feature of its corresponding
description in test set.

Spatial-level Evaluation Metrics from GMD [27]: We use Trajectory diversity, Trajectory error,
Location error, and Average error of keyframe locations. Trajectory diversity measures the root
mean square distance of each location of each motion step from the average location of that motion
step across multiple samples with the same settings. Trajectory error is the ratio of unsuccessful
trajectories, defined as those with any keyframe location error exceeding a threshold. Location error

18


---Page Break---
is the ratio of keyframe locations that are not reached within a threshold distance. Average error
measures the mean distance between the generated motion locations and the keyframe locations
measured at the keyframe motion steps.

Input

Instruction: two people greet each other with a handshake, while holding their cards in the left hand.
Given the instruction, generate 10 task plans according to the following background information, rules, and
examples. Each task plan should completely reflect an entire process of actions described in the instruction.
[start of background Information [
Human has JOINTS: [’pelvis’, ’left_hip’, ’right_hip’, ’left_knee’, ’right_knee’, ’left_ankle’, ’right_ankle’,
’left_foot’, ’right_foot’, ’neck’, ’left_collar’, ’right_collar’, ’head’, ’left_shoulder’, ’right_shoulder’, ’left_elbow’,
’right_elbow’, ’left_wrist’, ’right_wrist’ [.
The total number of TIME-STEPS of human motion is 99, the frame-per-second of motion is 20.
The provided text instruction is describing two people performing some actions containing human joint contacts.
The height of all people is 1.8 meters, the arm length is 0.6 meters, and the leg length is 0.9 meters.
Two people are 2 meters away at the beginning (i.e., TIME-STEPS=0).
[end of background Information]
[start of rules]
1. Each task plan should be composite into detailed steps.
2. Each step should contain meaningful joint-joint pairs.
3. Each joint-joint pair should be formatted into {JOINT, JOINT, TIME-STEP, TIME-STEP, CONTACT TYPE,
DISTANCE}. JOINT should be replaced by JOINT in the background information. IMPORTANT: The first
JOINT belongs to person 1, and the second JOINT belongs to person 2. Each joint-joint pair represents a contact
of a joint of person 1 and a joint of person 2. The first TIME-STEP is the start frame number of contact, and the
second TIME-STEP is the end frame number of contact. CONTACT TYPE should be selected from {contact,
avoid}, DISTANCE should be a float number representing how many meters should be the distance of two
joints in the joint-joint pair. For [CONTACT TYPE: contact], the distance of two joints should be SMALLER
than the DISTANCE; for [CONTACT TYPE: avoid], the distance of two joints should be LARGER than the
DISTANCE. IMPORTANT: Consider the transition of contact types, leave time-steps more than 20 frames
without any joint-joint pair between different contact types. Use small DISTANCE variance between different
contact types: for the joint-joint pairs that are with [CONTACT TYPE: contact], do NOT use DISTANCE larger
than 0.5m in the following [CONTACT TYPE: avoid]; for the joint-joint pairs that are with [CONTACT TYPE:
contact], use [CONTACT TYPE: avoid] after 20 frames; for the joint-joint pairs that are with [CONTACT TYPE:
avoid], use NO joint pairs for 20 frames if the following CONTACT TYPE is contact. Try to not over-use
[CONTACT TYPE: avoid]: if there is no explicit semantics of being far away, just do not use joint-joint pair in
that frames; if there is explicit semantics of being far away, then use joint-joint pair with [CONTACT TYPE:
avoid].
4. Consider which JOINT will be interacted when two people perform the action described in the text instruction.
Translate the text instruction to be steps of joint-joint pairs. Do not include extra joint-joint pairs that is unrelated
to the text instruction. IMPORTANT: make joint-joint pairs in different task plans diverse in TIME-STEPS and
JOINTs. Each joint-joint contact pairs should be lasting from 3 to 10 frames.
5. Be plausible. Do not generate uncommon interactions. Generate plausible interaction time-steps, and consider
the velocity of human motions.
6. Use one sentence to describe what action should person 1 do and one sentence to describe what action should
person 2 do according to the text instruction at the beginning of the task plan. IMPORTANT: the sentence starts
from ’text 1:’ describing the action of person 1 from the perspective of person 1 and the sentence starts from ’text
2:’ describing the action of person 2 from the perspective of person 2. Sentences should NOT contain words like
’person 1’ or ’person 2’, use ’a person’ to refer to himself in the sentence and ’others’ to refer to others.
7. The steps in the task plan are for both two people. Use one set of steps to describe both two people. The first
JOINT belongs to person 1, and the second JOINT belongs to person 2.
8. IMPORTANT: Do NOT add explanations for the steps in task plans. Each step only have one joint-joint pairs.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We are the first method to perform zero-shot human interaction generation
by leveraging only single-person motion generation model, which could be supported by
abstract, introduction and method.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed our limitation in Sec. Conclusion and Limitations. The
main limitation is that we only investigated a certain form of interactions which could be
quantitatively described by spatial relations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

23


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have theoretical result.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have included all the information to reproduce the main experimental
results, and we also provide the code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the code in the supplemental material and the website.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We include all training and test details in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: It will be too computationally expensive.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

25


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We include the information of computer resources in appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our paper follows the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]

Justification: We have carefully considered potential societal impacts and determined that our
technical contribution of generating 3D skeletal animations poses minimal risks. Our method
is designed for generating multi-people 3D skeletons, and these skeletal representations do
not pose negative societal impacts.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

26


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not pose risks requiring such safeguards.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have cited the used code, data and models.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.

27


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have included the documentation of our code in the supplementary materi-
als.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
