Abstract

In the realm of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), vision-language
connector plays a crucial role to link the pre-trained vision encoders with Large
Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, the vision-language connec-
tor has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong
vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while
maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors
in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract
them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer),
a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge
obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation
of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds
compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods.
This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer. Codes are available
at https://github.com/liuhaogeng/Anchor-Former.

Introduction

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point within contemporary
research discourse[47]. Prominently showcased by seminal works such as LLaVA [33, 34], BLIP-2
[27], Qwen-VL [4], and Flamingo [1], these models exhibit exceptional efficacy across a broad spec-
trum of tasks, spanning from nuanced image description [29, 48] to complex visual reasoning. Their
versatility transcends conventional boundaries, finding practical application in quotidian scenarios
such as smartphone interface design [21] and consequential real-world decision-making processes
[13]. This advancement is attributed to the availability of pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) [44] and vision encoders [41]. By utilizing these pre-trained components and introducing
a connecting layer between them, it is possible to construct robust MLLMs with only training the
lightweight vision-language connector. This enables the development of MLLMs with the capacity to
process visual inputs while retaining the linguistic prowess characteristic of LLMs. These enhanced
MLLMs exhibit proficiency across various tasks, including narrative generation, code composition,
and addressing complex queries [45].

In the construction of above MLLMs, the vision-language connector plays a pivotal role. A funda-
mental approach, as demonstrated in LLaVA [34], employs a linear projection layer as the connector.
In the enhanced version, LLaVA-1.5 [33], the linear projection layer is expanded into a multilayer

perceptron, enhancing the model’s efficacy. Despite achieving notable performance, the large number
of visual tokens, which extends the time required for computing attention and other processes [8],
indicating potential for optimization to decrease the computation cost. Prior efforts have sought to
address this concern. For instance, BLIP-2 [27] introduces Q-Former and Flamingo [1] proposes
Perceiver Resampler, both leveraging learnable queries as visual information aggregators. This
mechanism utilizes the cross-attention between learnable queries and the outputs of visual encoders to
effectively reduce the length of the visual sequence, thereby lowering the computation cost. Similarly,
Qwen-VL [4] adopts a comparable structure but eliminates self-attention among the learnable queries.
While these vision-language connectors substantially improve efficiency compared to naive linear
projectors, they also exhibit a notable decrease in accuracy, as detailed in [5].

The primary computational bottleneck in MLLMs is the LLM component, where computational costs
escalate significantly with the length of the input sequence, including both visual and textual tokens.
To mitigate the computational cost, a straightforward approach is to reduce the number of input visual
tokens with vision-language connector. A commonly adopted method is attention pooling, which
offers greater flexibility than traditional pooling techniques. This method focuses on aggregating
information within the visual tokens, necessitating aggregators with high information-gathering
capabilities. Current attention pooling methods typically use randomly initialized learnable queries
as information aggregators. We identify two main drawbacks with this approach: (1) The queries are
randomly initialized without prior knowledge for aggregating visual information. They necessitates
training on massive datasets (hundreds of millions) to be effective, as showed in Table 5 (2) The
queries are fixed and invariant to different input images, potentially leading to significant information
loss and low specificity for uncommon inputs, as illustrated in [22, 39].

To address the aforementioned issue, we propose Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language
connector that enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of MLLMs compared with baselines. In
order to build AcFormer, we identify more effective information aggregators by analyzing the visual
features obtained from a pre-trained vision encoder from two perspectives: the feature map and
the attention map. Our analysis reveals the presence of “visual anchors” within the visual tokens.
Fundamentally, the transformers in the neural network aggregate information related to these visual
anchors, central to the transformation process. Moreover, the positions of these anchors vary across
different images. Despite this variability, we can effectively identify them using the attention matrix
to carry out the cost-effective progressively search algorithm. With these observations, we propose a

2

Anchor Selector, an important part of our AcFormer. The Anchor Selector utilize the progressive
search algorithm with respect to the attention map. By this way, it effectively extracts visual anchors
from the visual tokens generated by the Vision Transformer. And with the visual anchors, AcFormer
utilize the naive cross attention to aggregate visual information for generating dense and complete
visual representation.

In summary, our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We reveal the existence of visual anchors within the visual tokens generated by pre-trained
Vision Transformer, and subsequently propose cost-effective Anchor Selector to effectively
extract these visual anchors.

• We propose the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by
leveraging the rich prior of information aggregation within visual anchors.

• We conduct comprehensive experiments across various vision-language tasks to empirically
validate the efficacy of AcFormer.

Related Work

2.1
Multimodal Large Language Models

The development of MLLMs has become financially viable due to the utilization of pre-trained
vision encoders [41, 38, 12] and Large Language Models (LLMs) [44, 43, 52]. Spearheaded by
initiatives like Flamingo [1] and BLIP-2 [28], the field has witnessed significant advancements
[34, 42, 53, 3, 51, 45, 21]. Studies like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 have introduced methodologies such
as visual instruction tuning, enabling robust MLLMs capable of understanding human instructions.
Additionally, efforts such as Emu and LaVIT [24] have proposed unified frameworks for generation
and comprehension, integrating visual decoders and consolidating the training loss of visual and
textual inputs. The progression of MLLMs has been supported by the availability of extensive visual-
language training datasets [7, 33]. Innovations like Sphinx [32] and Monkey [31] have facilitated
high-resolution image processing through techniques like sub-image cropping, thus advancing open-
source MLLMs. Moreover, MobileVLM [10] has introduced a compact vision language model
suitable for deployment on mobile devices.

2.2
Vision-Language Connectors

Vision-language connectors typically employ either direct linear projection (LLaVA) or an informa-
tion aggregation module, such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and C-Abstractor, followed by linear projection.
LLaVA, utilizing a simple multi-layer perceptron, effectively aligns visual features with the embed-
ding space of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it suffers from high computational costs due to
redundant input visual tokens, as highlighted by [8]. BLIP-2 uses the Q-Former to aggregate visual
information and establish robust baselines, while Flamingo employs the Perceiver Resampler. Both
architectures leverage the cross-attention mechanism to aggregate visual information into learnable
queries. However, these approaches require extensive data for training and may have limitations in
tasks requiring fine-grained visual perception due to the constrained nature of the learned query’s
ability to capture all visual patterns. In contrast, Honeybee [5] proposes the C-Abstractor and D-
Abstractor to address these challenges by introducing spatial priors into the feature representation.
Our proposed method, AcFormer, consists of three parts: Anchor Selector, Information Aggregation
Module and Linear Projection. While Flamingo and BLIP-2 use learnable queries for information
aggregation, C-Abstractor applies a convolution network directly. Our method utilizes visual anchors
as information aggregators, generating dense and complete visual representations for input images.

Here we select 10 layers in Vision Transformer to show their output. We present the attention maps
corresponding to the [CLS] token in the final layer. Notably, special tokens within both the feature
map and attention map are identified using red circles. These marked points are referred to as “visual
anchors”. Details can be found in Section 3.2.

Rv is obtained as follows:

Rv = F(I) ∈RB×N×D.
(1)

Here, C, H, and W represent the channel, height, and width of the input image, respectively, while
N and D denote the number and dimension of the image tokens. There is one additional token, the
[CLS] token added for the global representation of the image in contrastive learning. After obtaining
the feature map, two common methods are used to combine it with LLM.

The first method utilizes gated cross-attention for modality fusion. Assuming the corresponding input
instruction with the image is T ∈RB×Nt×Dt, the computation can be expressed as:

Th = G(query = T, key = Rv, value = Rv),
(2)

where Th represents the hidden states of the LLM and G(·) denotes the gated cross-attention layer.

The other approach involves converting the visual tokens into soft embeddings nd concatenating
them with the text embeddings as the input of the LLM. Suppose the vision-language connector is
V-L-Connector,

LMin = Concat(Proj(V-L-Connector(Rv)), T),
(3)

Where Proj means the Linear Projection and T means the text embedding. LMin represents the
input embeddings of the LLM.

3.2
Visual Anchors

Within the ViT, the input pixel-level features undergo a series of transformations. Understanding how
the visual semantic is learned will bring us better insight of building the vision-language connector.
To analyse in a more intuitive way, we visualize the feature map and attention map.

Given a set of Vision Transformer’s feature maps, denoted as V ∈RN×D, where N represents the
number of tokens and D signifies the dimension of these tokens, we leverage dimension reduction
for visual feature visualization. Initially, we extract all hidden states from the Vision Transformer.
Subsequently, employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on each individual feature map, we
derive low-dimensional features. We select the first three principal components to yield V′ ∈RN×3,
followed by normalizing the pixel values to the range of [0, 255]. To visually represent these features,
we construct an image of the input size. Each patch within the image is then encoded using the
obtained three-dimensional representation, effectively encapsulating the corresponding region’s

4


---Page Break---
value within the image. By this way, we obtain the visualization of the features, as depicted in
Figure 2 (Row 1 and Row 3). Regarding the attention map, we derive it by extracting the attention
weights associated with the last layer’s [CLS] token. These attention scores reflect the significance
of respective tokens. We exclude the attention directed towards the [CLS] token itself, yielding the
attention map A ∈RH×N, where H and N denote the number of attention heads and visual tokens.
This process is depicted in Figure 2(Row 2 and Row 4).

Upon visual inspection, several noteworthy observations come to light. Specifically, the transfor-
mation of visual information exhibits a gradual obscuration of the feature map, accompanied by an
increasing activation of specific tokens (depicted as pink and light yellow patches in the first and
third lines, respectively). Initially, these activated tokens are just parts of the background, appearing
indistinguishable from surrounding elements. However, over time, they progressively differentiate
themselves from the background. Nevertheless, this evolutionary process lacks a discernible pattern.
Examining the attention map, the [CLS] token, commonly used for aggregate global information of
the input image, is anticipated to attend to the most salient regions. Paradoxically, the attention map
of the [CLS] token predominantly focuses on a limited subset of tokens. We calculate the overlap
among the activated tokens in feature map and the salient regions in attention map. The ratio reaches
up to 69.38% (500 images are sampled for calculation), conjecturing that this alignment is not
coincidental. For further validation, we visualize the pre-trained MLLMs text generation attention
matrix (text to visual tokens), result can be found in Figure 5.

Based on above observation, we name these tokens “visual anchors” and assume them serving as
pivotal points for information aggregation during the transformation of visual features. While the
[CLS] token indeed integrates visual information, its reliance alone proves insufficient, necessitating
the involvement of other visual anchors in conveying information to the [CLS] token. Consequently,
this process facilitates the extraction of meaningful representations from the image.

Anchor Former

As illustrated above, the vision information is aggregated through visual anchors. Similarly, within
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), structures such as Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler
also leverage information aggregation modules. However, these models use learnable queries as
Information Aggregator to extract information from the visual feature map produced by a pre-trained
Vision Transformer. In this method, the same queries are used for all images, which can lead to two
issues. First, their effectiveness requires extensive datasets for training as demonstrated in Table 5.
Second, they may lead to significant information loss, as illustrated in [5, 39, 22].

---Page Break---
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose Anchor Former (AcFormer), which consists of
Anchor Selector, Information Aggregation Module and Linear Projector. We show a rough view of
Anchor Former in Figure 3. Our approach integrates insights from visual anchors with the established
framework of the Perceiver Resampler. A key innovation in our method is the use of visual anchors
associated with each image as Information Aggregator for aggregating visual information. The
effectiveness of our approach relies on the selection of these salient points. This visual anchors allows
for more precise and specific information extraction, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of
the model.

Anchor Selector.
To avoid additional computation, we leverage the attention map of the [CLS]
token for visual anchor selection. We introduce a progressive search algorithm to construct the
Anchor Selector. Assuming the attention map is A ∈RH×(N−1), where H represents the number
of attention heads and N −1 denotes the number of visual tokens ([CLS] excluded). Let the token
index list be TL, initially containing only the index 0, corresponding to the [CLS] token, an essential
anchor. Suppose we still need TN tokens in addition to the [CLS] token. We select these tokens head
by head, assuming each head will provide TN

H tokens. For each head, , we first sort the indices of the
visual tokens based on their attention scores. Then, we select the top TN

H tokens from this sorted list.
If the chosen token is already in TL, we choose the next token in the sorted order until we have the
required number of unique tokens. We provide detailed algorithm in Figure 7.

Information Aggregation Module.
In our approach, we employ selected visual anchors as In-
formation Aggregator, combined with a cross-attention module to aggregate information. Let the
Information Aggregator be denoted as IA ∈R(TN+1)×D and the origin visual tokens as Rv ∈RN×D.
Our proposed model, Information Aggregation Module, is a bidirectional transformer encoder. We
denote the cross-attention module as Attn and the feedforward module as FF. Let LN represent layer
normalization. For a single layer in the model, the operations are as follows:

Aout = IA + Attn(query=LN(IA), key=LN(Rv), value=LN(Rv)),
(4)

H = Aout + FF(LN(Aout)),
(5)

Where H means the hidden states. We use Hv to represent the last hidden states. Let T represents text
embedding. We use the Proj to represent the Multilayer Perception. We obtain the final multimodal
input embeddings for LLM as bellow,

LMin = Concat(Proj(Hv), T).

Experiments

Settings

Benchmarks.
We employ nine distinct benchmarks to comprehensively assess the overall efficacy
of our proposed method. The specifics of these benchmarks are delineated in Table 7. Notably, in our
experimental setup, as we reduce the number of image tokens, our focus is primarily directed towards
enhancing visual perception capabilities. As a result, we pay particular attention to benchmarks such
as TextVQA, which challenged the model’s fine-grained visual perception ability [21, 31].

Implementation details.
In our experimental setup, we utilize 7B and 13B Vicuna-v1.5 as Large
Language Models (LLMs) [9]. The CLIP ViT-L/14 model, pre-trained with a resolution of 336,
serves as our vision encoder. We select the last but one layer’s output from the vision encoder as
our vision feature. For Anchor Former, we configure it with 6 layers and a hidden dimension of
512, employing 8 attention heads, each with a dimension of 64. The feedforward module utilize
2048 as the hidden dimension. Regarding the training dataset, we leverage the dataset utilized in
LLaVA-1.5 [33], with 558k samples for pre-training and 665k samples for instruction tuning. Our
experimentation encompasses the evaluation of various vision-language connectors, including the
Perceiver Resampler, Anchor Former, pooling, C-Abstractor and utilizing pooled tokens as queries
for the Perceiver Resampler. To maintain consistency, we construct our model using the official code
provided by LLaVA. Specifically, we adjust the pre-training initial learning rate from 1e−3 to 5e−4.
Other configuration is the same with origin LLaVA-1.5.

Main Results

We present the main results in Tables 1 and 2, organized by benchmark type. Upon observation of
these tables, it becomes apparent that our model achieves robust performance despite being trained
with limited data and visual tokens. Notably, even with only 145 or 257 tokens, our model achieves
performance comparable to that of the original LLaVA-1.5 model, which utilizes 577 visual tokens as
input. This performance holds across various benchmarks, including those that require high-level
visual perception (e.g., VisWiz, TextVQA) and those that assess overall capability (e.g., MME, GQA).

However, it should be noted that although our model is overall effective, it performs slightly worse
than LLaVA-1.5 on certain benchmarks such as GQA and VQAv2. Given that our method only applies
significantly fewer visual tokens (less than half), the slightly performance drop meets expectations.
Nevertheless, the performance gap is relatively small and can be considered marginal in light of the
substantial increase in speed.

tokens as queries for the Perceiver Resampler. Random-PR means the Perceiver Resampler using
randomly selected tokens from the vision feature map as query. PR refers to the commonly used
Perceiver Resampler. Our experimental findings validate the efficacy of our model from multiple
perspectives. A comparison between PR and AcFormer indicates that the observed enhancement
does not stem solely from an increase in trainable parameters. Additionally, comparison between
AcFormer and Random-PR underscores the critical role of Anchor Selector in model performance.
Furthermore, our evaluation of AcFormer against C-Abstractor reveals that the significance of
inductive bias diminishes, as spatial coherence can be effectively maintained through cross-attention
mechanisms within the Perceiver Resampler.

C-Abstractor.
We trained the model with training data from LLaVA-1.5. Our findings, as presented
in Table 3, indicate that the C-Abstractor method achieves comparable performance to AcFormer
across most benchmarks. However, in tasks such as TextVQA, which necessitates high-level visual
perception (often demanding fine-grained visual analysis), C-Abstractor exhibits inferior performance.
This empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of our proposed AcFormer.

Pooling.
One immediate consideration is to aggregate visual tokens based on their spatial positions
by pooling and combine them with the [CLS] token to form the input visual features. Our empirical
investigation reveals that direct pooling emerges as a potent technique for compressing visual
information. However, it fails in TextVQA, leading to around 3 points drop.

Pooling-PR.
Given our direct utilization of pooled tokens within Large Language Models, a concern
arises regarding whether the observed degradation stems from the reduction in trainable parameters
within the Anchor Former. To address this concern, we conducted additional experiments wherein
the pooled tokens served as queries for the Perceiver Resampler, termed as Pooling-PR. Examination

8


---Page Break---
of the results in the table reveals that this approach yielded even poorer performance compared to
directly inputting the pooled tokens.

Random-PR.
While our method demonstrates superior performance compared with other ap-
proaches, a lingering question pertains to whether this improvement indeed stems from the Anchor
Former. To address the concern, we randomly select tokens from the vision feature map as the
Information Aggregator. The empirical results presented in Table 3 corroborate the efficacy of our
proposed anchor selection method, substantiating its discernible impact on model performance.

PR.
While substantiated the effectiveness of AcFormer, an unresolved question pertains to its
superiority over the commonly used Perceiver Resampler, which employs randomly initiallized
learnable queries for visual information aggregation. Examination of the table reveals that the
Perceiver Resampler exhibits the poorest performance among the aforementioned methods. This
observation underscores the diminished performance of the structure under conditions of limited
training data.

Anchor Direct-in.
A related study [20] employ Top-K selection methodology for token com-
pression. This approach shares similar token selection method with ours and involves the direct
utilization of selected tokens as representations (without further cross attention) for visual infor-
mation. However, it primarily caters to classification tasks, which prioritize global understanding,
potentially rendering it less suitable for tasks requiring nuanced comprehension. Noteworthy is the
proposition by the authors of Haurum [20] regarding EViT. They employ the selected tokens and
incorporate pooling mechanisms for the remaining tokens as input. The findings, as detailed in Table
4, empirically underscore the significance of retaining unselected tokens, as they still encapsulate
valuable information.

Scaling Up the Training Dataset

We conducted a data scaling experiment to further evaluating our proposed method’s performance
on large-scale data scene. Considering the expensive training cost, we replaced the Large Language
Model with OpenLLaMA-3B [17]. Approximately 60 million image-text pairs were employed for
pre-training, sampled from Laion115M, coyo-238M, and laion-coco100M datasets. For instruction
fine-tuning, we utilized two datasets, covering LLaVA-665k and Cauldron [26]. Notably, Cauldron
(1.8M) is a larger instruction finetuning dataset than LLaVA-665k (0.66M) for MLLMs.

Our focus was on comparing Perceiver Resampler with our proposed AcFormer. The results,
summarized in Table 5, consistently demonstrate the superiority of AcFormer over the Perceiver
Resampler. This illustrate that our method not only works well for the scene of limited data but also
for larger data (both pre-train dataset and instruction tuning dataset).

Conclusions

In this study, we reveal the existence of the visual anchors and present the hypothesis that visual
anchors are strong visual information aggregators. With the observation, we propose the Anchor
Former, an effective vision-language connector. Notably, Anchor Former distinguishes itself from the
conventional information aggregation methods (e.g., Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler) by adopting

visual anchors as Information Aggregator. To build Anchor Former, we present the progressive search
algorithm to effectively extract the visual anchors. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks
consistently underscores the efficacy of Anchor Former in improving the models’ accuracy while
simultaneously removing the redundant visual tokens in MLLMs.

Visualization of The Feature From OpenAI CLIP

We have shown the visualization of the feature map and attention map of EVA-CLIP-L in the main
text. To validate whether other models (OpenAI-CLIP) also has the same characteristic, we offer
analogous visualizations in Figure 4, revealing comparable phenomena. While diverging from EVA-
CLIP-L in certain aspects, OpenAI-CLIP-L nevertheless manifests certain anchor points. These
shows that our observation is not an isolated case.

Visualization of The Attention Map From The Pre-trained MLLMs

To further substantiate our hypothesis, we conducted visualizations of the attention matrix of the pre-
trained Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs). We believe directly obtaining the generated text’s
attention will give us better understanding of the visual anchors. Recognizing the potential generation
of multiple tokens simultaneously, we adopted a methodology akin to LLaVA’s approach, constraining
the model to provide single-word or phrase responses for visualization of the attention mechanism on
the answer (key word). Given the multilayered architecture of MLLMs, we specifically chose middle
layers for visualization, as prior work [8] has indicated their pivotal role in comprehending visual
signals.

Two types of MLLMs are considered, exemplified by Flamingo and LLaVA. As Flamingo segregates
attention between text-only and image-text modalities, we opted for this model for visualization
purposes. It is noteworthy that we excluded the Perceiver Resampler and directly leveraged all visual
tokens to discern their relative importance. The visualization is accessible in Figure 5.

C
More Samples For Visual Anchor Visualization

We provide more visualization samples in Figure 6 to demonstrate that the phenomenon of vision
anchors exists in both complex real-world scenes and animated scenes.

D
Detailed Algorithm

We have provided a rough description in Figure 3. Here, we present the detailed Python code for
token selection in Figure 7. The complete code is available in the supplementary material. We use
a top-k search to select visual tokens. Specifically, assume the attention matrix is A ∈RH×1×N,
where H is the number of heads and N is the number of image patches. We traverse each head of the
attention matrix, and for each head, we select T−1

H
tokens based on the sorted indices and already
selected sequence to avoid duplication. Here, T represents the total number of desired tokens.

Training Resources

We provide details for our training resource for main experiment in Table 6. Notably, for the data
scaling experiment, we utilize 16 Nvidia A100 (80G). It takes roughly 28 hours for pre-train and 5
hours for IFT.

Detailed Description of The Benchmarks

There exist numerous benchmarks for assessing the proficiency of Multi-Modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), each imbued with its own inherent biases. For instance, benchmarks such as OK-
VQA [37] primarily concentrate on appraising the model’s pre-existing knowledge base. Conversely,

benchmarks like TextVQA [40] and VizWiz-VQA [18] scrutinize the models’ prowess in visual
perception. Notably, a plethora of newly introduced benchmarks tailored specifically for MLLMs
have surfaced. MME [15] and MMBench [35] stand out as comprehensive benchmarks aimed at
gauging the overall performance of MLLMs. However, they mandate MLLMs to furnish responses
in binary or multiple-choice formats. POPE [30] has been devised to assess MLLMs’ propensity
for hallucination. MM-VET [50] and InfiMM [19] scrutinize the open-ended question-answering
capability of MLLMs, aided by the assistance of GPT-4.

G
Limitations

Although we have conducted extensive experiments, there are still aspects requiring further investiga-
tion. For instance, the utilization of larger training datasets with corresponding larger models remains
unexplored due to resource constraints in our experiments. Additionally, more theoretical analysis
are needed for better elucidating the underlying reasons for the emergence of these visual anchors.

H
Broader Impacts

Our model, despite its capabilities, may encounter certain risks. As it is built upon LLaMA, Vicuna,
and CLIP, it inherits some issues associated with large language models (LLMs) and vision encoders.
One significant risk is hallucination, where the model might generate content that contradicts the
facts. This poses a concern, especially when applied in critical fields such as medicine. Additionally,
biases present in the LLM and vision encoder (CLIP) could be transferred to our model, potentially
resulting in biased outputs. Lastly, while energy consumption is not a primary concern due to the
smaller pretraining dataset used, it may become an issue when scaling up the pretraining dataset or
increasing the model size.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We give main claims accurately in abstract and instruction.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We discuss the limitations at section G.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [No]

18


---Page Break---
Justification: This is an observational and experimentally validated study, with no
theoretical argumentation involved.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This work can be fully reproducted with the information from the paper. We
provide the main code in the appendix 7 in detail.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

19


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our model is built based on the open-sourced LLaVA, so our provided code in
Figure 7 is enough for reproduction of the method.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the implementation details in paragraph 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We experiment on many different benchmarks to eliminate statistical error.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

20


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the training resources in section Table 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: There is no bias or other special about the research.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide Broader Impacts in section H.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

21


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our proposed method is easy for reproduct that we will not release the model.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We follow the license of the data and code used in our experiment.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

22


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There are not any asset in the paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
