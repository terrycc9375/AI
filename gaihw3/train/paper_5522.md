Abstract

As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applica-
tions, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This
paper evaluates LLMs’ reasoning abilities in competitive environments through
game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic
reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBENCH, a language-
driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive
game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static,
and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we ➊Characterize the
game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and ➋Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as
reasoning evaluation. We observe that ➊LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding
various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and determinis-
tic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; ➋Most
open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less
competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the re-
cently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition,
code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning
methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not al-
ways help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as
equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are
provided for a better understanding of LLMs’ behavior. We hope our research pro-
vides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur further explorations
in the strategic reasoning of LLMs.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into critical real-world applications,
such as cybersecurity (Ameri et al., 2021; Aghaei et al., 2022), decision science (Jiang et al., 2023b),
and finance (Wu et al., 2023). These areas involve advanced strategic thinking and logical reasoning
skills, including the ability to foresee possible dangers and weaknesses (Yao et al., 2024b; Duan et al.,
2024a), systematically examine difficulties, and make informed decisions based on provided evidence.
However, evaluation environments that thoroughly assess these situations are not sufficiently explored.

There has been an emerging trend where LLMs are evaluated in various interactive role-playing envi-
ronments, including collaborative environments such as CAMEL (Li et al., 2023), ReConcile (Chen
et al., 2023), and competition environments such as Diplomacy (Bakhtin et al., 2022), Werewolf (Xu
et al., 2023a), Avalon (Light et al., 2023; Stepputtis et al., 2023), multi-agent debate (Liang et al.,
2023; Du et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2023), board and card games (Duan et al.,

2024b). By engaging LLMs in simulated scenarios, role-playing-based environments offer useful
potential for analyzing the cognitive reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the extensive background
and intricate details involved in role-play-based games dilute the pureness of logic and strategic
reasoning that is typically found in game-theoretic tasks. Additionally, the evaluation is primarily
verbal as it hinges on spoken or written exchanges between the LLMs. This could mask instances
where LLMs might lack concrete reasoning abilities but navigate the scenario effectively through the
proficient use of language.

Why are game-theoretic tasks unique and necessary for LLM reasoning evaluation? Game-
theoretic tasks are typically conceptualized based on prevalent trade-offs and dilemmas manifesting
in real-life scenarios and are designed to be easy to understand yet require difficult skills to be
mastered. In contrast to the rich narrative contexts afforded in verbal- or role-playing-based games,
e.g., Werewolf (Xu et al., 2023a) and Avalon (Light et al., 2023), the reality of game-theoretic games
such as Chess and Go involve: ➊pure logic and strategic reasoning without the added complexity
of backgrounds or character roles; ➋embracing rigorous rules with well-defined action/state space,
which allow for an in-depth examination of the strategic reasoning of LLMs.

Hence, in order to spur more research in the LLM Game-Theoretic evaluation domain, we propose
GTBENCH, an environment consisting of 10 widely recognized game-theoretic tasks, across a com-
prehensive taxonomy of games, e.g., complete- (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4, Breakthrough) versus
incomplete-information (Kuhn Poker, Liar’s Dice) gaming, deterministic (Nim) versus proba-
bilistic (Negotiation, Pig) gaming, static versus dynamic (Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma,
Blind Auction) gaming. These environments require a variety of abilities including board strategy,
collaboration, auction, and bidding. There are two key issues investigated in this paper:

Characterizing Strategic Reasoning of LLMs: How LLMs will perform when facing various game-
theoretic scenarios? How do they perform compared to conventional solvers? How do essential factors,
e.g., pertaining, parameter sizes, and reasoning methods, affect strategic reasoning?
LLM-vs.-LLM Competitions as New Reasoning Evaluation: A new automated and adaptive bench-
mark that can be effective in evaluating reasoning errors even for future LLMs.

To address these crucial problems, we conduct experiments over two configurations: (a) LLM-
vs-Conventional where conventional solvers such as optimization- or search-based solvers, e.g.,
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Chaslot et al., 2008), are taken as the opponent of LLMs; (b)
LLM-vs.-LLM where two LLMs compete directly to reveal the reasoning limitations in an automated
manner. We find that: ➊LLMs almost always fail when playing against simple MCTS opponents
in complete and deterministic gaming scenarios (Section 4.1), while ➋LLMs remain competitive
in incomplete and probabilistic scenarios (Section 4.2); ➌Code-pretraining benefits game-theoretic

reasoning, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct (Roziere et al., 2023) achieves comparable results as GPT-
3.5-turbo, and significantly outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) (Section 4.3); ➍
Advanced reasoning methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), Self-Consistent
CoT (SC-CoT) (Wang et al., 2022b), Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2024a) are not always helpful;
➎Most open-source LLMs are less competitive than commercial LLMs in games with complex rules
and large action/state space, while the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct (Meta, 2024) makes up
for this shortcoming. The interfaces of GTBENCH leaderboard can be found in Appendix A11. Our
contributions can be summarized as the following:

• LLM Game-Theoretic Evaluation (GTBENCH): An LLM environment supporting 10 well-
recognized tasks across comprehensive game-theoretic taxonomy, is presented to spur future work
for the community. The code and leaderboard will be public and continuously updated for future
reasoning agents and LLMs.
• Essential Factors for the Strategic Reasoning of LLMs: We investigate how essential factors,
e.g., parameter size, code-pretraining, and reasoning methods, affect strategic reasoning. A detailed
error profile is provided for a better understanding of LLMs’ behaviors.
• Characteriz the Game-Theoretic Properties of LLMs: We characterize distinct LLM behav-
iors when facing different game-theoretic scenarios, such as LLMs fail in complete-information
and deterministic gaming yet remain competitive in probabilistic gaming. We further study the
equilibrium and Pareto efficiency during the gameplay.

Background and Problem Definition

2.1
Background and Related Work

LLM-as-Agent Evaluation. Several studies have been conducted to measure the effectiveness
of LLMs as agents in recent years. Hausknecht et al. (2020) carried out an extensive study to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in interactive fiction games. Zhu et al. (2023) provides a valuable
dataset for finetuning LLMs to improve usefulness in the strategic game Dungeons & Dragons.
GRUE (Ramamurthy et al., 2023) uses reinforcement learning-based metrics to benchmark the
performance of generation tasks in six different languages. Gandhi et al. (2023) test the use of
LLMs as a broker with human contestants in the negotiation game “Deal or No Deal". A few studies
have explored the use of text-based games as a means of facilitating learning in such environments.
ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020) introduced a novel virtual environment that allows agents to acquire
learning in a text-based environment while executing in a visual environment. The environment was
developed in conjunction with Building Understanding in Text world via Language for Embodied
Reasoning (BUTLER) agent, which can acquire abstract text knowledge in the text world. Similarly,
TextWorld (Côté et al., 2019) is introduced as an environment that enables RL agents to play text
games. Wang et al. (2022a) proposed ScienceWorld, a benchmark used for evaluating agents’
reasoning ability, and their findings showed that transformer-based models are not effective at
reasoning in novel contexts. MTBench (Zheng et al., 2024) introduces LLM-as-a-Judge where
GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) is utilized as a judge to evaluate the quality of LLM generations. It
indicates that GPT-4 shares close criteria as humans. There have been works evaluating LLMs in
solving real-world tasks, such as graph reasoning (Besta et al., 2023), WebShop (Yao et al., 2022),
AgentBench (Liu et al., 2023) for pragmatic missions, MINT (Wang et al., 2023b) for tool utilization.

Multiple LLMs-as-Agents in Gaming. A key research area is the competition and collaboration
between LLMs. Many studies examine LLMs’ strategic reasoning and performance, using evaluation
frameworks to assess multiple LLM agents in individual games, such as: Social deduction or
deception games (Xu et al., 2023a,b; O’Gara, 2023; Light et al., 2023), diplomacy games (Mukobi
et al., 2023; , FAIR), negotiation games (Abdelnabi et al., 2023; Davidson et al., 2023), coordination
and cooperation games (Akata et al., 2023), and Minecraft (Gong et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Fan
et al., 2022). These works not only provide evaluation frameworks for games and demonstrate the
flexibility of LLMs to a variety of gaming tasks but some provide meaningful datasets for fine-tuning,
policies for reinforcement learning to produce better strategies, or evaluate the strategic reasoning of
LLMs. However, many of these standalone works quantify either individual or a subset of desirable
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, such as negotiation, deception, or coordination. Further,
they often evaluate these capabilities for LLMs using one or two games which may produce less
robust assurances of LLM abilities.

‡ : The iterated version of Prisoner’s Dilemma allows participants access to the actions made by their opponents in the past rounds, achieving implicit collaboration.
†† : Inapplicable due to complex combination and dynamic environment.

We make an additional crucial contribution in this line of work by measuring strategic reasoning
capabilities with games that are not found in the existing unified benchmark suites (Zhang et al., 2024),
such as clembench (Chalamalasetti et al., 2023) focusing on conversational agents over non-zero-sum
games and LMRL-Gym (Abdulhai et al., 2023) on verbal reinforcement learning tasks. (Chen et al.,
2024) and Duan et al. (2024b) also proposes multi-agent strategic reasoning evaluation. However,
they overlooked the analysis of LLM behaviors in response to different game-theoretic scenarios and
their associated properties. Differently, GTBENCH seeks to provide a unified suite of games that are
carefully curated to (1) evaluate a comprehensive collection of strategic reasoning abilities for a given
agent and (2) enable competition-based scenarios (i.e., LLM agent-1 vs LLM agent-2) allowing for
competition-based comparisons of strategic reasoning capabilities by LLM-based agents.

2.2
Problem Definition

Notation: Gameplay. We formulate the gameplay as a Markov Decision Process (S, A, M, O)
under a given game environment, among the alternating interaction of two participants. This process
composes of an infinite state space S, an infinite action space A, the participants M = {M1, M2},
and an observation space O. Considering the decision of Mi (i = 1, 2) at the t-th step of the process,
we denote by st ∈S the state that Mi are placed and ot ∈O the observation that Mi are observing.
We assume Mi follows policy πθi(at|st, ot) for state transition T : S × A →S, where at ∈A is
the action sampled by πθi under conditions st and ot. θi is determined by the implementation by Mi,
e.g., optimization-based solver, LLM-driven agents, which will be discussed in Section 3.2 in detail.
In this way, the two-participate gameplay can be represented as (s0, a0, s1, a1, s2, · · · , sn), where
s0 is the initial state and sn is a terminal state, i.e., end of the game. The progress is driven by the
alternating execution of actions sampled by participants. Please refer to Section 3.1 and Appendix A2
for all the supported games with the corresponding actions and observations.

Evaluation Metric: Normalized Relative Advantage. We introduce Normalized Relative Advan-
tage (NRA), denoted NRA(Mi, Mo, fs), to measure to relative advantage of Mi when competing
against Mo, under the score calculation fs:

NRA(Mi, Mo, fs) =
P

m fs(Mi, m) −P

m fs(Mo, m)
P

m fs(Mi, m) + P

m fs(Mo, m),

where fs(Mi, m) refers to the score earned by Mi at the m-th match (1 ≤m ≤K, K is the
number of performed matches):

• For zero-sum games, e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe,

fs(Mi, m) =








1,
if Mi wins at the m-th match
0,
if Mi loses at the m-th match
0.5,
if Mi and Mo achieve a draw

• For non-zero-sum games, e.g., Blind Auction, fs(Mi, m) is the rewards earned by Mi at the m-th match.

NRA(Mi, Mo, fs) is naturally normalized to [−1, 1], providing an interpretable meaning regarding
the performance of Mi: NRA(Mi, Mo, fs) > 0 means Mi is better than Mo; NRA(Mi, Mo, fs) <
0 means Mi is worse than Mo; NRA(Mi, Mo, fs) = 0 means Mi is as competitive as Mo.

Evaluation Metric: Elo Rating. Following the conventional rating mechanism in the real world,
e.g., Chess, we employ the popular Elo Rating (Elo, 1960) for calculating the relative skill levels of
players in zero-sum games. Please refer to Appendix A7 for more details of Elo rating.

GTBENCH: Game-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs

GTBENCH is a language-driven environment, making participating agents compete against each
other in a game-theoretic manner. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, providing unified
interfaces to participants and games, and supporting various multi-turn-based games which can
be extended in the future. The overall framework is presented in Figure 1. There are three main
components: Environment, Prompt Adapter, and Participant. Please refer to Appendix A1 for a
detailed introduction of each component.

3.1
Taxonomy of Game-Theoretic Tasks

The chosen tasks and their detailed configurations are presented in Table 1. To comply with
the common taxonomy (Lanctot et al., 2019) of game-theoretic tasks and provide diverse gam-
ing scenarios, GTBENCH supports 10 different gaming environments, including Tic-Tac-Toe,
Connect-4, Kuhn Poker, Breakthrough, Liar’s Dice, Blind Auction, Negotiation, Nim,
Pig, Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, covering 6 mainstream game-theoretic configurations, in-
cluding complete- and incomplete-information gaming, dynamic and static gaming, and probabilistic
and deterministic gaming. The preferred abilities of each game could be characterized as the combi-
nation of board strategy, bids, collaboration, bluff, and math. Please refer to Appendix A2.1 for the
rules of each game and Appendix A2.2 for an explanation of game-theoretic taxonomy.

3.2
Participants and Protocols

Conventional Agents output actions through a conventional optimization or searching process.
To provide fair comparisons, we employ the powerful Monte Carol Tree Search (MCTS) (Chaslot
et al., 2008) as the conventional agent for most of the games, with the number of simulations as
1000. Since Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma is dynamic gaming with very limited action space,
i.e., <TESTIFY> or <SILENT>, we utilize the more popular Tit-for-Tat (Axelrod, 1981) strategy,
which simply repeating the opponent’s last action, as the conventional agent. We also include
Random Agent that randomly selects action at each turn, serving as a baseline and sanity check.
Please refer to Appendix A3.1 for more details about MCTS Agent and Tit-for-Tat Agent.

LLM-Driven Reasoning Agent consists of backbone LLMs and reasoning paradigms. For reasoning
schemes, we consider the following reasoning paradigms as they are widely known to be effective
for general reasoning tasks: ➊Prompt: Directly Prompt LLMs to generate responses, without
additional reasoning steps; ➋Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022): CoT Agent prompts LLMs
by thinking step by step; ➌Self-Consistent CoT (Wang et al., 2022b): SC-CoT Agent prompts LLMs
by generating multiple step-by-step thinking trajectories and performing majority voting to get the
final response. The number of trajectories is set to 5 in this paper; ➍Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al.,
2024a): ToT Agent prompts LLMs to generate responses by incorporating exploration and deliberate
decision-making, e.g., self-evaluation. The number of sequences for both answer generation and
answer evaluations is set to 3.

Prompt Templates. Prompts are designed to be modular, consisting of four individual components:
System Prompt, Head Prompt, Observation Prompt, and Reasoning Prompt. Reasoning prompts,
e.g., CoT/ToT, are designed to only focus on instructing LLM how to think, regardless of the game
environment. Thus, they could be automatically adapted when adding a new game. Please refer
to Appendix A5 for the detailed prompts and observations for each game and agent.

Sanity Check. We provide the task completion rates of all the LLMs and reasoning agents in Ap-
pendix A5.6. We show that all the LLM agents achieve ≥90% completion rate, indicating that the
prompts are properly configured and LLMs are capable of following instructions to finish the game.

Are LLMs Capable of Strategic Reasoning?

In this section, we evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs by conducting experiments
among conventional solvers and LLM-driven agents.

Experimental Settings. We consider well-recognized LLMs such as commercial LLMs: GPT-
3.5-turbo-1106 and GPT-4-0613 (Achiam et al., 2023), and open-source LLMs: Llama-3-70b-
Instruct (Meta, 2024), Deepseek-LLM-67b-chat (Bi et al., 2024), Llama-2-70b-chat (Touvron et al.,
2023), CodeLlama (Roziere et al., 2023), and Mistral-7b-Orca (Jiang et al., 2023a; Mukherjee et al.,
2023). For all the LLMs, the temperature is set to 0.2 and the max number of generated tokens
is 1024. For each competition, we run 50 valid matches. The final performance is measured by
the averaged NRA over the 50 valid matches. To mitigate the first-player advantage, we have each
participant take the first turn in 25 matches.

4.1
Complete and Deterministic Gaming

There are four complete and deterministic tasks supported in GTBENCH: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4,
Breakthrough, and Nim. We compare LLM-driven agents with Random Agent and MCTS Agent.
Results are summarized in Figure 2. In general, we show that all LLMs achieve substantial relative
advantages when competing against the Random Agent. Among all the agents, GPT-4 w/ CoT
reasoning achieves the highest NRA. For open-source LLMs, Llama-3-70b-Instruct outperforms
other open-source LLMs, achieving comparable capabilities as GPT-4.

However, when competing against the MCTS Agent, all the LLM agents equipped with various
reasoning methods achieve NRA as −1, meaning that LLM agents can barely win even a single match.
This is because for board games with moderate action/state space such as the four involved complete
and deterministic games in GTBENCH, MCTS agents with a sufficient number of simulations
can achieve near-optimal strategies. Consequently, LLMs are not competitive in complete and
deterministic games.

There are five probabilistic game-theoretic
gaming tasks:
Kuhn Poker, Liar’s Dice,
Blind Auction,
Negotiation,
Pig, and
one dynamic task:
Iterated Prisoner’s
Dilemma. We group these games together as
they all involve stochasticity in the gameplay,
which is essentially different from complete and
deterministic games. The Random Agent as the
opponent is omitted for both Negotiation and It-
erated Prisoner’s Dilemma because the Random
Agent rarely chooses to collaborate, resulting
in meaningless evaluation. Results are summarized in Figure 3. When competing against the
MCTS Agent, it is shown that Liar’s Dice shares a similar trend as the complete and determin-
istic scenarios (Figure 2), where LLM-driven agents achieve near −1 NRA. This is because the
2-player Liar’s Dice has very limited stochasticity, making the gameplay tend to be complete
information. For other tasks, we found that LLMs do not always fail. We observe that the NRA
of LLM agents is close to 0 over all the tasks, indicating that they are equally competitive as
conventional solvers or even better (e.g., Kuhn Poker where GPT-4 outperforms MCTS Agent).

We investigate whether popular LLMs remain

ically, we take GPT-3.5-turbo with Prompt
Agent as the common opponent and make other
LLM-driven agents compete against it. Please
refer to Figure A6 for the full leaderboard eval-
uated by NRA. The Elo rating results are placed
in Table 6. In general, GPT-4 is the most power-
ful LLM in strategic reasoning among all the ex-
amined LLMs. Moreover, Llama-3-70b-Instruct
achieves comparable performances as GPT-4
and outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo. Here we break
the results into 3 takeaways:

Code-Pretraining Benefits Game-Theoretic
Tasks. In Table 2, we show code-pretrained
LLMs,
e.g.,
CodeLlama-34b-Instruct
and
Deepseek-Coder-6.7b-Instruct, significantly out-
perform larger chat LLMs, e.g., Llama-2-70b-chat and Deepseek-LLM-67b-chat. These code-
pretrained LLMs have less than half of the parameters, suggesting that code-pretraining benefits
game-theoretic tasks. This verifies recent discoveries where code-pretraining benefits logical reason-
ing (Madaan et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023).

Advanced Reasoning Methods Do Not Always
Help. We observe that advanced reasoning methods
may lead to worse results in game-theoretic scenar-
ios. To make it more clear, we present the averaged
NRA obtained by reasoning methods across differ-
ent LLMs when against Random Agent in Figure 4.
In general, only Mistral-7b-Orca has a substantial
improvement when equipped with CoT reasoning
while advanced reasoning leads to worse results for
other LLMs.

In Table 3, we present the results when against GPT-
3.5-turbo w/ Prompt Agent. We show that advanced
reasoning benefits powerful LLMs, e.g., GPT-3.5-
turbo, while it results in worse results for other
LLMs. It suggests that advanced reasoning is a

---Page Break---
double-edged sword: ➊powerful LLMs are capable of leveraging advanced reasoning to achieve
better results; ➋advanced reasoning may also impose reasoning errors and risks during the inference
of ordinary LLMs. In Appendix A8, we further examine five different CoT strategies over the
GPT-3.5-turbo model to mitigate the effect brought by prompt sensitivity, along with some failure
cases presented. These CoT prompts resulting in different performances are all worse than the naive
Prompt Agent.

Most Open-source LLMs are Less
Competitive than Commercial LLMs
in Complex Games. We observe that
most of open-source LLMs such as
Llama-2-70b-chat and CodeLlama-34b-
Instruct are not good at games with com-
plex rules and board states. In Table 4,
we present the average NRA when in-
cluding and excluding Breakthrough3. It is shown that both Llama-2-70b-chat and CodeLlama-
34b-Instruct fail in Breakthrough, resulting in worse NRA scores than GPT-4. However, we
found that the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct (Meta, 2024) has a significant performance
in Breakthrough. This indicates that open-source LLMs achieve comparable capabilities when
dealing with complex tasks and environments as commercial LLMs.

Error Profiles

We introduce the most prevalent mistake patterns observed across different games, comprising
Misinterpretation, Factual Inaccuracies, Overconfidence, Calculation Mistakes, and Endgame:

Misinterpretation denotes the misinter-
pretation of the game’s current state by
LLMs, including errors like misattribut-
ing piece ownership and failing to rec-
ognize vacant spots on the board. Fac-
tual Errors refer to situations where the
player has a reasonable plan but their actions do not align with their plan.
For instance, in
Breakthrough, GPT-4 w/ CoT agent plans to fend off frontal attacks by the opponent, which
is reasonable. However, it takes rear pieces to achieve that, which is impossible. Over-confidence de-
scribes a scenario where a player overlooks potential risks in pursuit of greater rewards. Calculation
Errors refer to errors that occur in arithmetic, such as calculating XOR in Nim. Endgame Misdetec-
tion means a failure to recognize immediate win/lose situations, e.g., a player fails to recognize a
potential winning move. Demonstrations of each mistake pattern are presented in Appendix A9.

In Table 5, we present the quantitative results regarding these error patterns. It is obtained from GPT-4
w/ CoT agent when playing against conventional solvers, e.g., MCTS/TfT agent, as the opponent.
We manually examined a total of 157 turns (50 matches, with 5 turns per match). We observe that
LLM agents are capable of generating reasonable planning/strategies. However, they have difficulties
in selecting the correct actions to align with their thoughts. Also, LLMs miss endgame situations,
leading to a failure to recognize winning and losing moves.

The Game-Theoretic Properties of LLMs

Nash Equilibrium with Regret. In game theory, being close to a Nash Equilibrium (Nash Jr,
1950) indicates that the strategies chosen by the players are near to optimal. It has been popular to
approximate Nash Equilibrium with Regret4 (Johanson et al., 2012; Nisan and Noti, 2017; Zinkevich
et al., 2007). In Figure 5a, we present the regret values of LLMs on Blind Auction and Iterated
Prisoner’s Dilemma. Please refer to Appendix A10 for how regret values are calculated for
these two tasks. For Blind Auction, GPT-4 shows lower Regret, indicating achieving closer to
optimal solutions than other LLMs. However, in Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, CodeLlama-
34b-Instruct exhibits lower regret compared to GPT-4. Through human examination, we found that
this is because GPT-4 tends to <Silent> more frequently, whereas Codellama has a significantly
higher probability of <Testify>. This discrepancy may be due to the human preference alignment
in GPT-4, such as a higher emphasis on morality (Pan et al., 2023) or maximizing system reward5,
which makes GPT-4 less likely to <Testify>.

Pareto Efficiency. We study Pareto Efficiency in two games: Negotiation and (Iterated)
Prisoner’s Dilemma. In Figure 5b, we count all agreements reached by participants and record the
values attributed to each based on the agreed division. Most agreements result in substantial values
for both participants, though some LLMs, like Llama-2-70b-chat and CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, may
accept unfair resource divisions. In contrast, GPT-4 and Mistral struggle to reach agreements and tend
to negotiate for Pareto improvements. A repeated game is a standard game that is played multiple
times by the same players, with each player is able to observe the history of past plays (Aumann
et al., 1995; Akata et al., 2023). In Figure 5c, we investigate the Pareto Improvement in Iterated
Prisoner’s Dilemma and ordinary Prisoner’s Dilemma, i.e., each round is played individually.
The Pareto Improvement is observed in the repeated-game scenario during the rounds, indicating that
LLMs are capable of leveraging history to adjust their strategies.

Conclusion

This work investigated LLMs’ strategic and logical reasoning abilities under competitive scenarios.
To achieve this, we created a broad evaluation scope by considering various classic and LLM-
based gaming agents and 10 representative games. We conducted the benchmark study of game-
theoretic evaluations for LLMs, shedding light on their reasoning performance. Our extensive
evaluations revealed insightful LLMs’ gaming behavior, such as their intrinsic failure in complete
and deterministic games, impressive reasoning in incomplete and probabilistic games, and benefiting
from code-generation pertaining and appropriate prompt designs.

Limitations
This research prompts LLMs to generate actions regarding various game scenarios,
relying on pre-defined prompt templates. Thus, the results may suffer from certain variances
introduced by prompt sensitivities. Although the introduced games are popular, their actions/state

4Regret (Zinkevich et al., 2007) measures how much a player would have improved their outcome by
choosing a different strategy, given what they know now after the game has played out.

space is limited, which may not be well-distinguished for LLMs in the same skill levels. The
generated actions may be illegal due to the incapabilities of the following instructions.

Impact Statements
This paper examines the game-theoretic task proficiency of AI models. We
acknowledge concerns about models becoming autonomous entities with their own objectives,
especially in deception or negotiation scenarios. It’s important to note that our research measures the
current capabilities of models, rather than enhancing their abilities. We do not train AI models to
be competent in game theory tasks or to bluff or defect. Instead, we assess existing competencies,
contributing to a deeper understanding that can inform innovative measures against potential risks.
We believe our work paves the way for responsible and effective AI safety.

Overall Architecture

There are three main components in GTBENCH:

• Environment. The environment ( Figure 1 (c)) is responsible for overseeing the crucial processes
related to gameplay. Specifically, it is tasked with building up observations, managing gameplay,
and applying the actions obtained from participants. In this paper, all of the gaming environments
are built on top of OpenSpiel Lanctot et al. (2019).
• Prompt Adapter. The prompt adapter ( Figure 1 (b)) plays a vital role in facilitating effective
communication between the environment and the virtual participants. It serves as an intermediary
between the two entities by receiving observations from the environment, which it then translates
into unified observation prompts. The prompts are then parsed and sent to the participating agents to
formulate their responses. The adapter is also responsible for obtaining actions from the participants,
which it transforms into legal actions before parsing them to the environment for game execution.
• Participant. The participants ( Figure 1 (a)) involved in the gaming process generate responses
according to the observation prompts received from the Prompt Adapter. These responses consist
of actions that participants intend to take in this turn.

Gameplay Configurations

A2.1
Games Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe6 is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in
a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming
optimal play from both players.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “opponent moves” and “self moves”. “Opponent
moves” contains all the current opponent agent’s historical actions. “Self moves” contains all the
current agent’s history actions.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <CxRy>, in which C and R mean columns
and rows respectively, while x and y mean the index of column and row. Each player may make
their own action in turn.

Prisoner’s Dilemma7 is a game theory thought experiment that involves two rational agents, each of
whom can cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner ("defect") for individual reward.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “opponent moves” and “self moves”. “Opponent
moves” contains all the current opponent agent’s historical actions. “Self moves” contains all the
current agent’s history actions.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <Silent> or <Testify>. All players must
take their action simultaneously.

Breakthrough8 Breakthrough is an abstract strategy board game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000
and made available as a Zillions of Games file (ZRF). It won the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition.
The first player to reach the opponent’s home row — the one farthest from the player — is the winner.
In our work, we scale the size of the board to 3*8 while maintaining its competitiveness.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “opponent moves”, “self moves”, and “board
preview”. “Opponent moves” contains all the current opponent agent’s historical actions. “Self
moves” contains all the current agent’s history actions. The “board preview” feature maintains the
status of each grid on the board through a list of strings, denoting whether it contains a black piece,
a white piece, or is empty.

• Actions: We define our action in the following format: Ax->By, in which A and B mean the
current column index and destination column index respectively, while x and y mean the index of
current row and destination row. Each player may make their own action in turn.

Connect Four9 is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored
tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first
to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own tokens.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “opponent moves” and “self moves”. “Opponent
moves” contains all the current opponent agent’s historical actions. “Self moves” contains all the
current agent’s history actions.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <Cx> in which C means column, while x
means the index of column. Each player may make their action in turn.

Blind Auction10 is a common type of auction. In this type of auction, all bidders simultaneously
submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays
the price that was submitted. All players must take their action simultaneously.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “valuation”.“Valuation” contains each of the values
of all the items for the current player.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <x>, in which x represents the amount
that a certain player would like to bid for.

Kuhn Poker11 is a simplified form of poker. Kuhn is a simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-
information game, amenable to a complete game-theoretic analysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes
only three playing cards, for example, a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player,
which may place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, the player
with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains “card” , and “moves”. Among these, “card”
denotes the current player’s hand card in this match, while “moves” represents the history of all
characters’ moves together with the index of the rounds.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <Pass> or <Bet>. Each player may make
their own action in turn.

Liar’s Dice12 is a class of dice games for two or more players requiring the ability to deceive and
detect an opponent’s deception.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains: “Self dice face value” and “last move”. “Self
dice face value” describes all the face values of dices the current player has, while “last move”
represents the previous player’s action.
• Actions: We define our action in the following format: < x dices, y value> or <Liar>. Among
these, x means the quantity of dice, and y means the face values of the dice. The option “Liar”
denotes the current player wants to stop and challenge the previous players. Each player may make
their own action in turn.

Pig13 is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish,
adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains: “self current score”, “opponent current score”, and
“turn total score”. “Self current score” and “opponent current score” represent the game culminated
score of the current player and opponent player respectively. While “turn total score” denotes the
sum of the score of the current turn.

Nim14 is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from
distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object and may remove any
number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile.

• Observation (input): Our observation contains: “piles”. “Piles” denotes the number of matches
different piles have.

• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <pile:x, take:y>. Among these, x
represents the index of the pile that the current player takes, and y represents the number of matches
the current player takes. Each player may make their own action in turn.

Negotiation15

• Observation (input): Our observation contains: “turn type”, “item pool”, “most recent proposal”,
“most recent utterance”, and “self value vector”. “turn type” is an enum variable, it has two options:
proposal and utterance. The “Proposal” is the turn that the current player could think about the
desired quantities of the items, and the “Utterance” is the turn that the current player states the
values to its opponent. “item pool” represents the quantities of all the items.“most recent proposal”
and “most recent utterance” represent the opponent’s latest proposal and utterance. “self value
vector” represents how much the value of the items to the current player.

• Actions: We define our action in the following format: <Agree> or < x, y, z >. Among these,
<Agree> represents the current player agreeing on the opponent’s utterance. x, y, and z represent
the quantities of different items that the current player wants to get.

A2.2
Gaming-Theoretic Taxonomy

Complete and Incomplete Information One fundamental dimension along which games are classi-
fied is the level of information available to players. In complete information games, players possess
perfect knowledge regarding the game’s structure, including the available strategies, payoffs, and the
actions taken by other players. Examples of complete information games include canonical examples
like chess and Tic-Tac-Toe, where all relevant information is transparent to all players throughout
the game. Conversely, incomplete information games involve situations where players must make
decisions without having full knowledge of the game’s parameters or the actions of other players.
Classic examples of incomplete information games include strategic interactions in economics, such
as auctions or negotiations, where players have limited knowledge about the valuations or preferences
of other participants.

Dynamic and Static Another crucial dimension for classifying games is the timing of players’
decisions. In static games, players make decisions simultaneously, without the opportunity to observe
or react to other players’ moves. Examples of static games include simultaneous-move games like the
Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. In contrast, dynamic games involve sequential decision-making,
where players observe previous moves before choosing their actions. Dynamic games encompass a
wide range of strategic environments, from turn-based board games like chess to dynamic settings
like Kuhn Poker, where players strategically make their actions based on the unfolding dynamics of
the game.

Probabilistic and Deterministic Games can also be differentiated based on the role of uncertainty in
decision-making. In deterministic games, the outcomes of players’ actions are fully determined by
the game’s rules and the strategies chosen by players. Deterministic games include classic examples
like chess or Tic-Tac-Toe, where each move leads to a predictable outcome based on the game’s
rules and the players’ strategies. Conversely, probabilistic games involve randomness or uncertainty
in determining outcomes. This uncertainty can stem from elements such as dice rolls, card draws.
Examples of probabilistic games include games of chance like Kuhn Poker, Liar’s Dice, or Pig,
where players must contend with the inherent uncertainty of probabilistic outcomes.

Participants

A3.1
Conventional Agent

MCTS Chaslot et al. (2008) is a heuristic search algorithm that has gained prominence in recent years,
particularly in the domain of board games and decision-making under uncertainty. It is characterized
by its ability to efficiently explore large search spaces by sampling potential future outcomes through
Monte Carlo simulations. The algorithm iteratively builds a search tree by simulating random
sequences of moves from the current game state and evaluating their outcomes through repeated
simulations. By focusing computational resources on promising branches of the search tree, MCTS
aims to guide the search towards regions of the game space that are more likely to lead to favorable
outcomes. MCTS has demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, including games like Go,
where traditional search algorithms struggle due to the game’s immense complexity and branching
factor.

Tit-for-Tat Axelrod (1981) is a simple but powerful strategy in the realm of repeated games and social
dilemmas. The strategy is based on the principle of reciprocity, where an agent initially cooperates and
then mimics the opponent’s previous action in subsequent rounds. Specifically, Tit-for-Tat starts by
cooperating in the first round and then replicates the opponent’s last move in each subsequent round.
Despite its simplicity, Tit-for-Tat has been shown to be remarkably effective in promoting cooperation
and achieving favorable outcomes in various scenarios, including Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma
and evolutionary simulations. Its success stems from its ability to balance cooperation and retaliation,
fostering reciprocal behavior and encouraging cooperation among interacting agents.

Prompt and Protocol

A5.1
Modular Prompt Structure

When prompting LLMs to generate the next action during the course of a game, the prompt is com-
posed of four individual components, to make sure all the participants access the same observations
and information from environments:

System Prompt provides general guidance on how the LLMs should perform.

Head Prompt provides the general background and rules of the game.

Observation Prompt is formatted by a fixed game-wise template, providing sufficient observations
from the environment regarding the current gaming state, to make LLMs capable of making decisions.
The following provides the template used in the Blind Auction environment:

Your budget is <VALUATION>. Your bid must be strictly lower than or equal to <VALUATION>. Your
opponent also has an expected valuation and you do not know it.
The legal actions are: <LEGAL_MOVES>.

Here <VALUATION> and <LEGAL_MOVES> are variables and are obtained from a unified
<observation> object. In this way, all the participants are guaranteed to assess the same infor-
mation.

Reasoning Prompt guides the LLM’s generation process, e.g., “Let’s think step by step” for the CoT
Agent.

A5.2
System Prompt

The system prompt is the initial text or context provided by the user to prompt the model to generate
a response. This prompt serves as the starting point for the model to understand the user’s query or
input and generate a relevant and coherent response based on the provided context. We use the same
system prompt for different tasks in our work. Our system prompt is presented as follows:

System Prompt: You are a powerful gaming agent who can make proper decisions to beat the
user in gaming tasks. You are a helpful assistant that strictly follows the user’s instructions. You
must answer your questions by choosing one of the legal moves given by the user!

A5.3
Head Prompt

The head prompt is the text that explains the rules of the games to the LLMs. In our work, we
designed different prompts for each of the games.

• Tic-Tac-Toe

Head Prompt: Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a grid. Players take turns marking
a space with their respective symbols. The goal is to get 3 of one’s own symbols in a row,
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does. If all nine squares are
filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw. The Tic Tac Toe game is played on
a 3 by 3 grid, with the winning length as 3. Each move is represented by a string consisting
of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For instance, C1R2 means the
movement at the position of the first column and the second row of the grid. You are playing
this game with the user (opponent).

• Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma

Head Prompt: You and your partner are in the Prisoner’s Dilemma situation. Specifically,
if you <Testify> against your partner and your partner remains <Silent>, you will go free
while your partner will get 3 years in prison on the main charge. If you remain <Silent> but
your partner <Testify> against you, you will serve 3 years in prison and your partner will be
set free. If you and your partner <Testify> against each other, you and your partner will each

A19


---Page Break---
serve 2 years. If both you and your partner remain <Silent>, you and your partner will each
serve 1 year.

• Breakthrough

Head Prompt: Breakthrough is a two-player game played on a rectangular board. Players
take turns moving their pieces, which can move one space straight or diagonally forward if
the target square is empty. A piece can also move diagonally forward to capture an opponent’s
piece. Capturing is optional, and a player can only capture one piece per turn. The goal
is to be the first to reach the opponent’s home row, the farthest row from the player. If all
of a player’s pieces are captured, they lose. The game does not allow draws, as pieces can
only move forward or be captured. The Breakthrough board is identified by columns labeled
starting from A (from left to right) and rows numbered 1 to 8 (from bottom to top). The
intersection of a column and a row specifies a unique square on the board.

• Connect Four

Head Prompt: Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, where the players choose a
color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces
fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the
game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own discs.
You are a gaming agent who aims to beat me in Connect 4 games. Each move is represented
by a string consisting of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For instance,
C1 means the first column.

• First-price sealed-bid auction

Head Prompt: A first-price sealed-bid auction (FPSBA) is a common type of auction. It is
also known as the blind auction. In this type of auction, all bidders simultaneously submit
sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. The highest bidder pays
the price that was submitted.
Each action is represented by <x> where x refers to the bid.

• Kuhn Poker

Head Prompt: Kuhn poker is a simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-information
game, amenable to a complete game-theoretic analysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only
three playing cards: a King (K), a Queen (Q), and a Jack (J). One card is dealt to each player,
and the third is put aside unseen. The players take turns either <Bet> to match the bet raised
by the opponent or <Pass> to concede the game.
If a player bets, the other player must either call the bet by matching it or fold by conceding
the game. If both players pass, the game is over, and the player with the higher-ranking card
wins. The card rankings are as follows: King (K) > Queen (Q) > Jack (J).
You are playing Kuhn poker with the opponent. The actions are denoted by <Bet> and
<Pass>.

• Liar’s Dice

Head Prompt: Liar’s Dice is a game of bluffing and probability, played with two players
and each player has 1 dice. During each turn, a player can either bid a higher quantity of any
particular face value or the same quantity of a higher face value than the previous bid. Each
player tries to outbid their opponent without being caught in a lie. The move in this game is
denoted in <x dices, y value>, meaning there are at least x dices with face values as y.

• Pig

Head Prompt: Pig is a fast-paced dice game where players risk accumulating points with
each roll but risk losing them all if they roll a 1. Each player must decide when to stop rolling
and bank their points, aiming to be the first to reach 100 points. You are playing Pig with the
other.

• Nim

A20


---Page Break---
Head Prompt: In Nim, a strategic game with a set of four piles containing 1, 3, 5, and 7
matches respectively, players aim to avoid taking the last match. During each turn, a player
may take any number of matches from a single pile, but must take at least one and cannot
exceed the number remaining in that pile. The objective is to force the opponent to pick up
the final match, thereby winning the game.
The action is presented in <pile:x, take:y>, which means take y match(es) from the x-th pile.

• Negotiation

Head Prompt: You are negotiating the division of Peppers, Strawberries, and Cherries with
the opponent. Different values these items hold for both you and your opponent. The process
is structured into two stages per round: the proposal stage and the utterance stage.

A5.4
Observations

Our research team has developed a range of observation prompts tailored to different types of games.
The list of these prompts is presented below.

• Tic-Tac-Toe

Observation Prompt: Your opponent has finished actions: <OPPONENT_MOVES>. You
have finished actions: <SELF_MOVES>.

• Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma

Observation Prompt: You have been through this situation in the past and here are the
decisions you and your partner made: (In the idx + 1 th round, you decided to <MOVE> and
your opponent decided to <OPPONENT_MOVE>) * n round

• Breakthrough

Observation Prompt: The board now looks like : <BOARD_PREVIEW>. Among which,
the letter ‘b’ represents a black piece, while the letter ‘w’ represents a white piece. And
the character “.” represents vacant space. The numbers in the board are the indexes of the
rows. Your opponent has finished actions: <OPPONENT_MOVES>.You have finished actions:
<SELF_MOVES>.

• Connect Four

Observation Prompt: Your opponent has finished actions: <OPPONENT_MOVES>. You
have finished actions: <SELF_MOVES>.

• First-price sealed-bid auction

Observation Prompt: Now, you are in an auction with an opponent. You want to win the
object and at the same time, your budget is <VALUATION>. Your bid must be strictly lower
than or equal to <VALUATION>. You shall bid wisely against your opponent. Your opponent
also has an expected valuation and you do not know it.

• Kuhn Poker

Observation Prompt: In this match, your card is <CARD>. Here are the past moves in this
match: <SELF_MOVES>, <OPPONENT_MOVES>.

• Liar’s Dice

Observation Prompt: Currently, the face value of your dice is <FACE_VALUE>. Last time,
the opponent called <OPPONENT_LAST_ACTION>. You are playing the Liar’s Dice with
another opponent. Therefore, there are only two dice in total.

• Pig

Observation Prompt: Right now, your current score is <AGENT_CURRENT_SCORE> and
your opponent’s current score is <OPPONENT_CURRENT_SCORE>. In this turn, you have
earned <TURN_TOTAL_SCORE> score.

• Nim

Observation Prompt: Currently, the 1st pile has <PILES[0]> match(es), the 2nd pile has
<PILES[1]> match(es), the 3rd pile has <PILES[2]> match(es), 4th pile has <PILES[3]>
match(es).

• Negotiation We proposed two different prompts for the “proposal” turn and “utterance” turn
respectively.
For the “proposal” turn, we have:

Observation
Prompt:
Now,
the
opponent
propose
to
take
<OPPONENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[0]>
peppers,
<OPPONENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[1]>
strawberries,
and
<OPPONENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[2]>
cherries

the
utterance
of
the
opponent
was
to
take
<OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[0]> peppers, <OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[1]>
strawberries, and <OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[2]> cherries from the item pool.
Now, it is your decision. If you find the proposal raised by the opponent is acceptable, you
should output Agree. Otherwise, you should output your proposal in the format <Proposal:
[a, b, c]>.

For the “utterance” turn, we have:

Observation Prompt: Last time, you propose to take <AGENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[0]> pep-
pers, <AGENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[1]> strawberries, and <AGENT_PROPOSAL_TAKE[2]>
cherries from the item pool.
Last time, the utterance of the opponent was to take
<OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[0]> peppers, <OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[1]>
strawberries, and <OPPONENT_UTTERANCE_TAKE[2]> cherries from the item pool.
Now, it is your turn to provide your utterance regarding the division of items. The utterance is
what you want to tell your opponent and does not mean your real intent. You should output
your utterance in the format <Utterance: [a, b, c]>.

A5.5
Reasoning Prompt

• Prompt agent: Prompt agent does not necessitate the use of LLMs to apply any predetermined
strategy prior to decision-making. Rather, it simply requests LLMs for inference and subsequently
provides the outcome.

You must choose a legal action to set up advantages. Your output must be in the following
format:
Action: Your action wrapped with <>, i.e., <format>
Please return your answer without explanation!

• CoT agent: CoT agent makes LLMs consider the given observation first, then give out the action
according to its thinking.

First think about your current situation, then you must choose one action from legal actions to
set up advantages.
Your output must be in the following format strictly:
Thought: Your thought.
Action: Your action wrapped by <>, i.e., <format>
Remember, you can only choose one move from the legal actions.

• SC-CoT agent: SC-CoT agent is an advanced version of the CoT agent. It obtains actions from
multiple CoT trajectories. It employs the same prompt templates as in the CoT agent.

set up advantages.
Your output must be in the following format strictly:
Thought: Your thought.
Action: Your action wrapped by <>, i.e., <format>
Remember, you can only choose one move from the legal actions.

• ToT agent: we follow the text generation task implementation in the official codebase of ToT 16.
Specifically, the ToT is factorized into 1). candidate thought generation, 2). thought voting, 3).
candidate action generation, 4). action voting:
Here we provide the basic prompt template used in ToT.

Step Prompt: First think about your current situation, then choose one move from legal
positions to set up advantages.
Your output should be of the following format:
Thought:
Your thought.
Move:
Your action wrapped with <>, e.g., <format>

After executing step prompts in a breath-first search manner, we utilize the original ToT vote
prompt:

Vote Prompt: Given an instruction and several choices, decide which choice is most promis-
ing. Analyze each choice in detail, then conclude in the last line "The best choice is s", where
s the integer id of the choice.

A5.6
Sanity Check

To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform a sanity check by calculating the
completion rates of each game. The completion rates are calculated as 50

N where N is the number of
matches that will take to achieve 50 valid matches. Here, a valid match means all the participants
will always generate legal moves at each turn of the match. Results are summarized in Table A7. We
show that all the LLM agents achieve ≥90% completion rate, showing that the prompts are properly
configured and LLMs are capable of following instructions to finish the game.

How Temperature Affects LLM Performance

To study how the temperature used in generating LLMs’ responses affects performances, we conduct
experiments by making LLMs with 0.2 temperature (the default setting as in our paper) play against
LLMs with 0.4/0.6/0.8 temperature, over CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo-1106. For
each experiment, we run 20 matches. The reasoning method is the PromptAgent. The results are
summarized as in Table A8. We show that a larger temperature will result in worse performance for
deterministic games, while it has a model-specific effect for probabilistic games.

Elo Rating System

The Elo rating system Elo (1960) is a popular method for calculating the relative skill levels of players
in two-player games such as Chess. It was used by various organizations to rank players. Assume
there are two players: A and B, and each player has a rating, RA, RB, which is a numerical value
representing their skill level. The expected score for a player is the probability that the player will
win against another player:

EA =
1
1 + 10(RB−RA)/400

EB =
1
1 + 10(RA−RB)/400 .

After a match between A and B, the real values, SA and SB, are defined as

• If Player A wins, SA = 1 and SB = 0

• If Player B wins, SA = 0 and SB = 1

• If the game is a draw, SA = SB = 0.5

Then, the updated rating R
′
A and R
′
B are calculated as:

R
′
A = RA + K ∗(SA −EA))

R
′
B = RB + K ∗(SB −EB)),

where K is a constant that determines how much the rating changes after a game. A higher K results
in a larger change. In our paper, the initial rating is set to 1500, i.e., RA = RB = 1500, and K = 20.

Breakthrough

Thought: I can see that my opponent has advanced their pieces quite far,
and I need to make strategic moves to gain an advantage.
I should prioritize moving my pieces forward while also considering potential capture opportunities.
Action: <c4->b5>

1
Breakthrough

Thought: Considering the current board position and the opponent’s recent moves,
it seems that the best move would be to advance the white piece at b3 to c4,
capturing the black piece at c4.
This move would help in gaining control of the board and putting pressure on the opponent.
Action: <c3->c4*>

2
Breakthrough

Thought: I see that the opponent’s pieces are advancing towards my home row,
and they have already captured one of my pieces.
I need to start advancing my pieces and try to create opportunities for capturing the opponent’s pieces
to gain an advantage.
Action: <b2->b3>

3
Nim

Thought:In this state, the total number of matches is 4, which is a losing position in Nim.
To win, I need to force the total number of matches to be a multiple of 4 after my turn.
This means I should aim to leave 3, 7, 11, or 15 matches for my opponent after my move.
Action: <pile:4, take:3>

Nim

Thought: The current state of the game is such that the total number of matches remaining is 3,
which is a losing position for the current player.

Game
Category
Demonstrations

Breakthrough
Factual Error
LLM Generation: “Considering the current situation,
moving the piece at b6 to either a5, b5, or c5 would al-
low me to advance further into the opponent’s territory.
However, this could potentially expose my piece to be-
ing captured. On the other hand, moving a piece from
the back row (a8, b8, or c8) to b7 could potentially
block the opponent’s advance and provide a defensive
line. Action:<b8->b7>”.
Explanation: In the third round of this match, moving
the back row renders it impossible to hinder the oppo-
nent’s forward movement.

Nim
Calculation Error
State: 3 matches in Pile 2, 5 matches in Pile 3, and 7
matches in Pile 4.
LLM Generation: “The current state of the game is
such that the 2nd pile has 3 matches, the 3rd pile has
5 matches, and the 4th pile has 7 matches. The goal
is to avoid being the one to pick up the last match. To
achieve this, I need to consider the binary representa-
tions of the pile sizes and aim to make the XOR of
all pile sizes equal to zero. This will put me in a win-
ning position. Currently, the XOR of all pile sizes is 4
(011 in binary). To make this zero, I need to remove
4 matches from the 3rd or 4th pile. Action:<pile:3,
take:4>”.
Explanation: The XOR of the binary representations
of 3, 5, 7 is 1, not 4.

Iterated
Prisoner’s Dilemma
Over-confidence
LLM Generation: “Given the history of the previous
round, where both my partner and I chose to remain
silent, it seems that we are both inclined towards coop-
eration. This is a positive sign, as it indicates a level
of trust and mutual understanding. Considering the
potential outcomes, the safest option is to remain silent.
If my partner also remains silent, we both serve the
least possible time. Action: <Silent>"
Explanation: The player is overconfident that the part-
ner will cooperate and keep silent.

Connect-4
Misinterpretation
LLM Generation: “I have analyzed the current sit-
uation and identified that my opponent has taken the
center column, which gives them a significant advan-
tage. To counter this, I will take the corner column to
create a potential winning line. Action: <C1>.”
Explanation: Currently, the center column is unoccu-
pied.

Tic-Tac-Toe
Endgame Misdetection
State: The opponent finished actions <C2R1> and
<C2R2>, the agent finished moves <C1R1> and
<C3R1>.
LLM Generation: I have one mark in the first column,
and one in the third. I could potentially win if I get the
chance to mark the third row of the first column in the
next turn. Action: <C1R3>
Explanation: This is an immediate loss situation be-
cause the opponent has two pieces connected in a row
and <C2R3> is unoccupied. The agent missed that
they should take action <C2R3> to avoid lose

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We summarize our main empirical observations and conclusions in the abstract
and introduction.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made
in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA
answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much
the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section Limitation
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model
well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should
reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications
would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only
tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on
implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is
low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used
reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical
jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and
how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important
role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be
specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

A30


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they
appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof
sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide details about models and generative hyper-parameters in Section 4,
and all the prompts utilized in Appendix A5.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well
by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the
code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be
necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset,
or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good
way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions
for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large
language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to
the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the
dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors
are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the
case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some
way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have
some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

A31


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide access to the data and code.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to
access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized ver-
sions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 3, Section 4, Appendix A5, A6, A7.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 4.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run
with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call
to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of
the mean.

A32


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality
of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error
rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The results are obtained from endpoint API providers, e.g., OpenAI (Section
4).

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or
cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than
the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t
make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration
due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer:[Yes]

Justification: Section Impact Statements

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact
or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g.,
deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups),
privacy considerations, and security considerations.

A33


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to
particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any
negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point
out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate
deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a
generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that
generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being
used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional
or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mecha-
nisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback
over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section Impact Statements
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not
require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith
effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Section 4
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service
of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated
licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a
dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the
derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the
asset’s creators.

A34

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset
is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution
of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included
in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
