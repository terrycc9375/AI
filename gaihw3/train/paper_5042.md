Abstract

Event cameras, offering high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have
brought a new perspective to addressing 3D reconstruction challenges in fast-
motion and low-light scenarios. Most methods use the Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) for event-based photorealistic 3D reconstruction. However, these NeRF
methods suffer from time-consuming training and inference, as well as limited
scene-editing capabilities of implicit representations. To address these problems,
we propose Event-3DGS, the first event-based reconstruction using 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) for synthesizing novel views freely from event streams. Tech-
nically, we first propose an event-based 3DGS framework that directly processes
event data and reconstructs 3D scenes by simultaneously optimizing scenario and
sensor parameters. Then, we present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage estima-
tion module, which effectively reduces noise in event data to improve the robustness
of our method in real-world scenarios. Finally, we design an event-based 3D recon-
struction loss to optimize the parameters of our method for better reconstruction
quality. The results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction quality on both simulated and real-world datasets. We also
verify that our method can perform robust 3D reconstruction even in real-world
scenarios with extreme noise, fast motion, and low-light conditions. Our code is
available in https://github.com/lanpokn/Event-3DGS.

Introduction

3D reconstruction [8] plays a crucial role in various cutting-edge fields, such as robot vision, virtual
reality, and augmented reality systems. It usually enables the creation of accurate 3D models from
ideal frame sequences. Nevertheless, with conventional cameras, 3D reconstruction performance has
suffered from a significant drop in some challenging conditions [13, 36] (e.g., fast motion blur and
low light). Thus, how to use a new visual sensing paradigm for 3D reconstruction to overcome the
shortcomings of conventional cameras remains a partially unsolved issue.

Event cameras [9, 21, 30], namely bio-inspired dynamic vision sensors, fundamentally differ from
conventional cameras that capture frames at fixed intervals. Event cameras operate asynchronously,
recording light changes with dynamic events at the microsecond level. This unique property endows
event cameras with high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption, and low
latency. These advantages have driven their application in various challenging vision tasks [12, 20,
23, 41, 43, 50], including recent efforts in 3D reconstruction [32].

Despite efforts [3, 17, 42, 51] to use event cameras for 3D reconstruction, real-world performance
in terms of quality, robustness, and real-time capabilities still needs improvement. Traditional
non-learning optimization-based methods [3, 17, 32, 51] serve as the foundation for event-based
3D reconstruction, but they often struggle with robustness and rendering quality. Recently, Neural

Radiance Fields (NeRF) [10, 28, 40] have gained popularity for scene representation and novel view
synthesis from event data, utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and differentiable rendering.
Although these NeRF-based methods [1, 2, 6, 14, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 31, 35, 52] achieve impressive
results in photorealistic 3D reconstruction from neuromorphic cameras, they suffer from time-
consuming training and inference processes. Additionally, their implicit representations limit scene
editing capabilities. Moreover, NeRF have primarily been investigated using simulated data and
high-quality real-world images captured under ideal conditions (e.g., optimal lighting and minimal
noise), posing limitations on real-world 3D reconstruction. In contrast, the emergence of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) [5, 11, 15, 46, 47] presents a compelling alternative, boasting high reconstruction
accuracy and swift inference speed. However, 3DGS has predominantly been utilized with image or
video data for 3D reconstruction, with limited exploration in event streams.

To address this gap, we propose Event-3DGS, the first event-based reconstruction framework utilizing
3DGS for synthesizing novel views from event streams. More specifically, we introduce an event-
based 3DGS framework, enabling direct processing of event data and reconstruction of 3D scenes
while simultaneously optimizing scenario and sensor parameters. Then, we present a high-pass
filter-based photovoltage estimation module, effectively reducing noise in event data to enhance
the robustness of our method in real-world scenarios. Finally, we propose an event-based 3D
reconstruction loss to optimize the parameters of our method for better reconstruction quality.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction
quality on simulated and real-world datasets. This pioneering work in event-based 3D reconstruction
with 3DGS sets a new benchmark, opening new avenues for high-quality, efficient, and robust 3D
reconstruction in challenging real-world scenarios, such as extreme noise, fast motion, and low light.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We introduce Event-3DGS, the first framework that combines event cameras with 3DGS technol-
ogy, enabling 3D reconstruction in challenging real-world scenarios.

• We present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast estimation module, which effectively
estimates photovoltage contrast by reducing noise in event streams for robust 3D reconstruction.

• We design a novel event-based 3D reconstruction loss to optimize the parameters of our method
for better reconstruction quality.

Event-based 3D Reconstruction. Early attempts [3, 16, 17, 32, 51] at using event cameras for
3D reconstruction typically relied on geometric models and handcrafted features. However, these
non-learning, optimization-based methods often struggle to achieve robust and high reconstruction
quality. A growing trend is the use of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for scene representation and
novel view synthesis. For instance, Ev-NeRF [14] and E-NeRF [18] are some of the earliest works
to apply NeRF for event-based 3D reconstruction. These methods render images at different times,
generate events through differencing, and compare them with actual events. Further advancements
include DeNeRF [25] and EvDNeRF[1], which introduce Deformable NeRF for dynamic scene
reconstruction. EventNeRF [35] extends this by enabling colored rendering through the incorporation
of three-channel events into NeRF. Some methods like E2NeRF [31] and Ev-DeblurNeRF [2] perform
hybrid reconstruction to mitigate motion blur by combining blurred images with events. However,
these NeRF-based approaches face significant challenges, including the time-consuming generation
of novel views and limited scene editing capabilities due to implicit representations. Additionally,
NeRF have primarily been explored using simulated data and high-quality images captured under
ideal conditions, leaving a considerable gap between the models and real-world scenarios. Therefore,
our goal is to design a novel event-based 3D reconstruction framework that ensures high-quality,
efficient, and robust performance in real-world scenarios.

3D Gaussian Splatting for 3D Reconstruction. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [15] has significantly
advanced in 3D scene representation, offering notable advantages over NeRF by capturing complex
geometries and lighting effects more accurately and efficiently. These advantages make 3DGS
highly suitable for real-time and real-world applications. Extended works like 4DGS [46, 47]
and D-3DGS [48] further enhance dynamic scene rendering. Besides, some works integrate with
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) [39] and text-to-3D models [4] to expand 3DGS
capabilities. However, these methods have primarily been applied to image and video data, leaving

Method

3.1
Event-3DGS Architecture

To achieve high-quality, efficient, and robust 3D reconstruction in challenging real-world scenarios,
we propose a novel event-based 3D reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting (Event-
3DGS). As shown in Fig. 1, our framework mainly consists of three modules: high-pass filter-
based photovoltage contrast estimation, photovoltage contrast rendering, and event-based 3D
reconstruction loss. More precisely, we first present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast
estimation module that reduces noise in event data to enhance the robustness of our method in
real-world scenes (see Sec. 3.2). Then, we design a photovoltage contrast rendering module that
obtains the photovoltage contrast image by calculating the difference in light intensity in 3DGS. After
obtaining two contrast estimations, we propose a novel event-based 3D reconstruction loss to measure
the differences (see Sec.3.3). Finally, our method optimizes the 3D scene and camera parameters by
propagating gradients through backpropagation.

3DGS [15] demonstrates superior 3D reconstruction capabilities by rapidly converting input images
into highly detailed 3D point clouds, accurately representing the scene. For a specific 3D scene
represented by 3D Gaussian functions, the forward process of 3DGS can be regarded as a mapping
function G(T), which gets the rendered image by alpha blending in the corresponding camera pose
T in time t. For a single pixel on a single channel, alpha blending can be described as follows:

L =

N
X

i=1
liαi

i−1
Y

j=1
(1 −αj),
(1)

where L denotes the pixel value result, which can be intensity or one of the three channels. li and αi
are the color and opacity of each point mapped to this pixel, respectively.

Event cameras operate on a fundamentally distinct imaging principle, generating event data in the
form of sparse points (see Sec. 3.2). This disparity prevents the direct integration of asynchronous
events into the original 3DGS formulation. To bridge this gap, we integrate event data seamlessly
with the output of 3DGS by leveraging photovoltage contrast (i.e., intensity changes). Considering
two close-in-time instances t1 and t2, the camera poses corresponding to these two moments are T1
and T2. We can obtain its photovoltage contrast between two moments using the proposed high-pass

filter-based photovoltage contrast estimation module, and it can be formulated as:

Dgt(·)t2
t1 = 1

θ((V (·, t2) −V (·, t1)),
(2)

where V (p, t) refers to the photovoltage in pixel p and time t.

Correspondingly, we need to use 3DGS to render the photovoltage contrast and light intensity, and
then compare these with the ground truth obtained from the event data for subsequent reconstruction.
The photovoltage contrast image can be obtained by the proposed photovoltage contrast rendering
module. The rendering process can be mathematically described as follows:

Dr(·)t2
t1 = 1

ˆθ
(log(G(T2) + ϵ) −log(G(T1) + ϵ)),
(3)

where G(T) denotes the intensity result in 3DGS. Dr(p) is the normalized contrast value in the pixel
p, and ϵ is a small number that avoids log(0). ˆθ is a learnable parameter, which is an estimate of the
threshold in the event sensor. For the sake of convenience in writing, we do not strictly distinguish
between time t and the corresponding pose T.

Given the intrinsic characteristics of event data, it’s essential to highlight that intensity estimation
methods [37, 45] are unlikely to outperform photovoltage contrast estimation techniques. Even
data-driven learning-based models [7, 34] may only yield visually appealing results without ensuring
physical accuracy and generality. To address this challenge, we proposed a dynamic adjustment
strategy for intensity to use high-quality photovoltage while ensuring robustness and stability.

3.2
High-pass Filter-based Photovoltage Contrast Estimation

To gain a deeper understanding of the high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast estimation module,
it’s essential to begin with a fundamental understanding of the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) [9]. The
DVS is designed to capture changes in light intensity pixel-wise and asynchronously. It accomplishes
this by converting the light spectrum into photocurrent as follows:

I(p, t) =
Z
λ · QE(λ) · L(p, t, λ) · dλ,
(4)

where L(p, t, λ) denotes the spectrum, t is time, p refers to the pixel coordinate {x, y}, and λ is the
wavelength of light. I(p, t) is the photocurrent or intensity in pixel p and time t. QE is quantum
efficiency, which represents the weighting of different wavelength light converted into photocurrent.

Subsequently, the photocurrent will be converted into photovoltage through a logarithmic function.
When the voltage change surpasses a predefined threshold θ, an event will be triggered [30] as:

V (p, t2) −V (p, t1) = σp
i θ,
(5)

where V (p, t) refers to the logarithmic operation of the photocurrent I(p, t). σp
i is either +1 or -1 by
comparing V (p, t2) and V (p, t1).

In general, the threshold θ is an inherent attribute of the DVS. It can be defined as follows:

θ = CdiffVth

UT Av
,
(6)

where Cdiff is determined by the capacitance in the ,Vth is a fixed constant, UT is thermal voltage,
and Av is voltage gain factor. This formula illustrates that θ often varies with sensor settings and
environmental changes, making it generally difficult to obtain its true value. In this work, we will
optimize the threshold θ together with the 3D scene.

Intuitively, asynchronous events appear as sparse points [19] in the spatiotemporal domain:

E(p, t) =

N
X

i=1
σp
i θδ(t −tp
i ),
(7)

where δ (·) refers to the Dirac delta function, with
R
δ (t) dt = 1 and δ (t) = 0, ∀t ̸= 0.

In this work, we implement the reverse process of dynamic event generation by extracting photovolt-
age contrast and intensity from the event stream E(p, t). The photovoltage is given as:

V (p, t) −V (p, ti) = E(p, tj) + w(p, t),
(8)

where ti and tj are the times corresponding to two adjacent events around t. w(p, t) denotes an
uncertainty term, which is determined by the mathematical principles of the event camera and is
unrelated to noise. This formula indicates that the event camera cannot accurately reconstruct the
intensity of light outside the triggering event’s timing. Moreover, since V (p, ti) is unknown, it is
also impossible to accurately obtain the intensity of light at each event’s timing. In short, only the
intensity difference between each event’s triggering times can be accurately obtained.

For the photovoltage between two events, we can simply assume:

w(p, t) = −E(p, tj), t < tj.
(9)

The above assumption will not interfere with the voltage at the time of event triggering. If E(p, t) is
ideal, V can be directly obtained from E through pure integration, that is:

ˆVd(p, t) = V (p, t) −V (p, t0) =
Z t

0
E(p, t)dt,
(10)

where ˆVd(p, t) is the photocurrent contrast to be estimate. Ideally, this method can accurately provide
the photovoltage contrast between the triggering moments of each event.

However, when event cameras are applied in real-world 3D reconstruction, they often encounter
various types of noise, making it challenging to accurately estimate the photovoltage contrast through
pure integration [37]. To address this issue, we use high-pass filtering to process the event data. The
high-pass filtering can be depicted as follows:

Vout(s)

Vin(s) =
sτ
1 + sτ ,
(11)

where Vout(s) and Vin(s) are the input-output signals after the Laplace transformation. τ is the time
constant related to the cutoff frequency. We treat
R t
0 E(p, t)dt as a noisy input Vin and ˆVd(p, t) as the
output Vout. When substituted into Eq. 11 and transformed back into the time domain, we obtain that:

ˆVd(p, t) = E(p, t) −1

τ
˙ˆVd(p, t),
(12)

where ˙ˆVd(p, t) is the differential with respect to the timestamp.

By simultaneously solving with Eq. 7, we can estimate the photovoltage contrast between any two
corresponding moments. Once the photovoltage is obtained, the intensity can be computed as:

I(p, t) = e
ˆVd(p,t)+ ˆVd(p,0).
(13)

V (p, t0) does not affect photovoltage contrast estimation. Therefore, our high-pass filter-based
method typically provides more accurate results than restoring pure photovoltage or intensity.

3.3
Event-based 3D Reconstruction Loss

For better reconstruction quality, we use a loss function with two key components: intensity estimation
and photovoltage estimation. The light intensity is evaluated as follows:

lt1
i = l1(I(·, t1), G(T1)),
(14)

where l1 is a loss function that computes the average of the absolute values between each pixel.

For the evaluation of photovoltage contrast, it’s important to consider that 3DGS uses a rasterization
method to generate the entire image at once. This means the rendering sampling time often does
not match the event triggering time for most pixels. According to Eq. 8, the ground truth of the
photovoltage contrast inherently contains some errors. Additionally, despite applying filtering
methods, event data still has significant noise that cannot be entirely eliminated. Consequently, if we
directly use the L1 loss to compare the rendered photovoltage contrast with the photovoltage contrast
calculated from event data, these errors will be strictly considered during the reconstruction process,

which can actually degrade the reconstruction quality. Thus, if a new loss can be designed that allows
for a certain tolerance in the estimation of photovoltage contrast, it would enable better completion
of the reconstruction task. For simplification, we denote Lp
g = Dgt(p)t2
t1, Lp
r = Dr(p)t2
t1. The loss
function of photovoltage contrast can be formulated as:

lp,t1,t2
e
(Lp
g, Lp
r) =
R(|Lp
r −Lp
g −β| −β)
if Lp
g > 0
R(|Lp
g −Lp
r −β| −β)
if Lp
g < 0 ,
(15)

where R(x) = max(0, x), and β is a measure of the tolerance in the estimated photovoltage contrast
obtained from rendering. When β is infinitely large, the loss becomes a trivial constant zero, imposing
no constraints. Conversely, if β is zero, the loss degenerates into a very strict L1 loss. Theoretical
analysis shows that setting β to 0.5 yields excellent results in the real-world dataset. When β is set to
0.5, it best aligns with the characteristics described in Eq. 8.

Finally, the total loss function for event-based 3D reconstruction can be described as follows:

lall(t1, t2) = α
X

p∈R2

lp,t1,t2
e
(Lp
g, Lp
r)
W ∗H
+ (1 −α)lt1
i ,
(16)

where W and H are the width and height of the image, respectively. α is a parameter that controls
the weight of the intensity. For the first 8000 epoch, α is set to 0 to give an initialization of the
reconstruction. Then, α is generally set near 1 to improve the quality of 3D reconstruction.

Experiments

4.1
Experimental Setting

Datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of our Event-3DGS, we conduct experiments on the DeepVox-
els synthetic dataset [38] and the real-world Event-Camera dataset[29]. For the synthetic dataset, we
use seven sequences with continuous 180-degree image rotations on a gray background as the ground
truth for reconstruction. These sequences are processed by the VOLT simulator [22] to generate event
data, offering a more realistic simulation than ESIM [33] with higher noise levels. For the real-world
dataset, we select five typical sequences that provide aligned image and event data under fast motion
and low-light conditions. For longer sequences, we typically utilize the initial 100 images for training
and evaluate performance on separate data not employed during reconstruction.

Implementation Details. We set τ to 0.05 for the high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast
estimation module. In the loss function, we set α to 0.9. For synthetic experiments with low noise,
β is set to 0, while for real data with higher noise, β is set to 0.5. We utilize E2VID [34] for
initial intensity estimation. We use E2VID+3DGS as a baseline for event-based 3D reconstruction,
comparing it with our full method to validate its efficacy. All experiments are conducted on an
AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32-Core CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. The
evaluation metrics use the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structural Similarity (SSIM) [44],
and the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [49].

Effective Test

Evaluation on Synthetic Data. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we select two state-of-the-
art methods (i.e., E2VID [34] and reconstructed images for 3DGS [15]) and our baseline using Pure
Integration without filtering for 3DGS (PI-3DGS) as three comparison methods. As shown in Table 1,
our method and our baseline outperform the representative reconstruction method (i.e., E2VID [34])
on the DeepVoxels synthetic dataset [38]. More precisely, our method has improved by 0.017 and
2.227 respectively compared to the competitor (i.e., E2VID [34]+3DGS [15]) in SSIM and PSNR,
while decreasing by 0.013 in LPIPS. Furthermore, we present some representative visualization results
on the DeepVoxels synthetic dataset [38] in Fig. 2. Note that, our method produces visually pleasing
images with fine details and fewer artifacts. For clarification, the visualization is for comparative
analysis, our method is capable of synthesizing novel views.

Evaluation on Real-world Data. To evaluate the performance of our method in real-world scenarios,
we present the comparative results of the real-world Event-Camera dataset[29] in Table 2. We select
three representative comparison methods to highlight the performance of Event-3DGS. Our baseline
(i.e., PI-3DGS) performs worse because the pure integration method for estimating light intensity
is sensitive to noise. Our method, with its high-pass filter-based photovoltage contrast estimation
module, effectively filters out noise in real scenes and improves reconstruction quality (see Fig. 3).
To demonstrate its robustness in extreme scenarios such as high-speed motion or low lighting, we
selected two typical scenarios in Fig. 4. We can find that conventional cameras struggle in low-light
conditions and produce significant motion blur in high-speed scenarios. These examples show that our
method can reconstruct 3D scenes from the event stream to overcome the limitations of conventional
cameras in challenging conditions.

Contribution of Each Component. To ex-
plore the impact of each component on the
final reconstruction performance, we chose
the pure integration image without the adap-
tive threshold and event loss as the base-
line. As illustrated in Table 3, We use three
different strategies (e.g., adaptive threshold-
ing, high-pass filtering, and loss function)
to enhance our baseline. As a result, our
method achieves the best performance among
all competitors. In other words, our method
employs these effective components to pro-
cess event streams for 3D reconstruction.

Influence of the Parameter α. To analyze
the hyperparameter α of the loss function, we
set the hyperparameter α with various values
(e.g., 0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, and 1). As
shown in Table 4, large values of α pose a
risk of the training deviating to suboptimal
points. Small values render the main phase
ineffective, resulting in degraded outcomes
similar to the initial phase.

Event-3DGS for Motion Deblurring. Our Event-3DGS can be further expanded to motion deblur-
ring. By integrating event data with RGB frames, our method can achieve deblurring effects using the
hybrid reconstruction manner. As shown in Fig. 6, We test the hybrid framework on some simulated
sequences [15] using VOLT [22]. Note that, a blurred image is generated through integration to serve
as the RGB input. Our Event-3DGS leverages event data to achieve deblurred color reconstruction.

Event-3DGS for Color Reconstruction. In general,
adding color information to 3D reconstructed im-
ages is crucial for visual appeal and downstream ap-
plications. To achieve this, we extend Event-3DGS
from a single channel to three channels to enable
color reconstruction. As illustrated in Fig 5, we se-
lected a video sequence [15] and utilized the VOLT
simulator [22] to convert the RGB channels into
events. Using our method framework, we jointly
reconstructed these three channels. The results in
Fig. 5 demonstrate that our method can achieve high-
quality color reconstruction.

Limitation. our method rendering module’s adap-
tive threshold learns a threshold for each scene but
doesn’t account for variations within the same scene
over time. Additionally, our current 3DGS lacks
support for dynamic scenarios, where 4DGS may be a solution. Future research will address these
limitations to enhance Event-3DGS practicality.

This paper introduces Event-3DGS, a pioneering
event-based 3D reconstruction framework that uti-
lizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to directly pro-
cess event streams for synthesizing novel views. We
present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage esti-
mation module to effectively reduce noise in event
data, enhancing the robustness of our method in real-
world scenarios. Additionally, we design an event-
based 3D reconstruction loss to optimize the parameters of our method. Our results demonstrate
that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational
speed on simulated and real-world datasets. We also verify that our method can perform robust 3D
reconstruction even in real-world cases with extreme noise, fast motion, and low-light conditions. We
believe that our method establishes a new benchmark for using 3DGS with event data, paving the
way for high-quality, efficient, and robust 3D reconstruction in challenging real-world scenarios.

Appendix / Efficiency Advantages over NeRF-based Method

To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach over existing NeRF-based event-based 3D reconstruc-
tion methods, we focus on three key aspects: the speed of rasterization compared to ray tracing, the
superior parallel support for rasterization in current GPU hardware, and the efficiency of manually
derived gradients over neural network backpropagation.

Firstly, the core algorithm of Event-3DGS relies on rendering the 3D Gaussian point cloud using
rasterization. Rasterization is inherently faster than ray tracing, which is the method used in NeRF.
This speed advantage is crucial for achieving efficient 3D reconstruction.

Secondly, modern GPU hardware is optimized for parallel processing in rasterization. This means
that rasterization can be executed with greater efficiency and speed compared to ray tracing, which
requires more computational resources and time to process each ray individually. The ability to
leverage the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs allows Event-3DGS to perform more efficiently.

Lastly, Event-3DGS utilizes manually derived gradients for optimization, bypassing the complex and
time-consuming process of neural network backpropagation used in NeRF. This not only reduces
computational overhead but also speeds up the overall process, enabling faster and more efficient 3D
reconstruction.

In summary, due to the faster nature of rasterization, better parallel support on GPUs, and the
efficiency of manual gradient derivation, Event-3DGS is significantly more efficient than existing
NeRF-based methods. This allows for high-quality reconstruction results to be achieved in less time.

B
Appendix / The Principle of Event-Based Deblurring based on Event-3DGS

To achieve Event-Based Deblurring using Event-3DGS (E-Deblur-3DGS), the key is to associate
blurred frames with event data. For a blurry frame camera, its imaging principle can be described as:

Y (p, t, C) =
Z t+te

t−te

Z
λ · QEC(λ) · L(p, ti, λ) · dλdti,
(17)

where C represents an additional color channel, typically red, green, and blue. QEC denotes the
response magnitude of this channel to different wavelengths of light, while te stands for the camera’s
exposure time, which is the primary cause of motion blur.

Comparing Equation 17 with Equation 4, we see that RGB cameras, while prone to blurring due to
their exposure time, offer rich color information. Conversely, event cameras, with their extremely
fast response times, capture almost no motion blur but only single-channel spectral information. By
combining these strengths through a loss function, motion deblurring can be achieved.

For the event data, we directly apply the loss described in the main text. For the blurry camera,
neglecting unit influence, we can sample the output of 3DGS, perform numerical integration, and
compare it with the blurry camera’s result, expressed as:

lt1
blur =
X

p

|Y (p, t1, ·) −(
R t1+te
t1−te G(T(t))dt)|

W ∗H
,
(18)

where W and H are the image’s width and height, T(t) is the camera pose at time t, and G(T(t)) is
the 3DGS render result. If the exposure time is not too long and the motion speed is not too fast, the
integral can be approximated using numerical integration with a single sample.

Finally, combining the above formulas, the resulting loss is:

lE−Deblur(t1, t2) = (1 −αblur) · lall(t1, t2) + αblur · lblur,
(19)

where αblur is a hyperparameter controlling the weight of lblur. By calculating the gradient with this
loss and jointly optimizing the scene and sensor parameters, a clear color image can be successfully
reconstructed.

Appendix / The Principle of Event-3DGS for Color Reconstruction

Since conventional DVS cameras lack color information capture capability, a new sensor type capable
of acquiring three-channel events is imperative. Its operational principle is defined as:

Ic(p, t, C) =
Z
λ · QEC(λ) · L(p, t, λ) · dλ,
(20)

where C signifies an additional color channel, typically denoted as red, green, and blue. QEC denotes
the magnitude of this channel’s response to various light frequencies.

Expanding our method algorithm to C-Event-3DGS merely requires extending the loss function. The
approach involves computing the loss for each channel’s event using the Event-3DGS method and
then aggregating these losses to derive the final loss:

lC−all(t1, t2) = αR · lall(t1, t2)R + αG · lall(t1, t2)G + αB · lall(t1, t2)B,
(21)

where lall(t1, t2)R, lall(t1, t2)G, and lall(t1, t2)B represent the loss calculated for each channel’s
event data using the original Event-3DGS algorithm. The parameters αR, αG, and αB are hyper-
parameters adjusting the weights of each channel. With this loss formulation, C-Event-3DGS can
reconstruct a color scene solely based on three-channel event data input. Note that in actual color
event cameras, the Bayer pattern is often used to achieve the color effect. Therefore, additional
post-processing is required during use, specifically interpolation to obtain the three-channel intensity
differences

Appendix / Additional Experiment Result

Visualization Results on Real Data. To further showcase the reconstruction prowess of Event-3DGS,
we present the reconstruction outcomes from various camera poses within the same scene, denoted
as "slider_depth". In Fig. 7, the results illustrate the real Event data reconstruction capabilities of
Event-3DGS. Each row in the figure corresponds to the camera positioned in the same pose. As we
progress from top to bottom, the camera gradually moves from left to right. Remarkably, Event-3DGS
consistently upholds high-quality image reconstruction across a spectrum of poses, underscoring its
robust 3D reconstruction capabilities.

Comparison with Ev-NeRF[14]. To highlight the accuracy superiority of our method over existing
approaches, we conducted a comparative analysis with the Ev-NeRF method using a real dataset.
Table 6 presents the performance evaluation of our method and Ev-NeRF in three typical real-world
scenarios. Observing the results, it’s evident that our method consistently outperforms Ev-NeRF
across all metrics in the real dataset. This substantial improvement across various scenarios strongly
attests to the superiority of our approach.

Impact of Training Iterations on Performance and Time. To empirically demonstrate the time
complexity of our proposed Event-3DGS, we investigate the impact of training iterations on its
performance and time requirements. Table 7 presents the performance and time metrics of Event-
3DGS using synthetic data. The "initial" stage in the table indicates the phase when the parameter
α is set to zero. Following this stage, α is adjusted to 0.99, and training proceeds consistently until
7999 iterations. The table illustrates that Event-3DGS achieves high-quality reconstruction results in
approximately five minutes. This indicates its potential for real-time applications.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We claim the contributions of this work at the end of the Introduction, and
elaborate on how we achieve them in the Methodology.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss about the limitations in the 9th page.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

16


---Page Break---
Justification: We make the assumption and proof in the method section.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the detailed experimental settings and the code in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided the code on the supplementary material.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have present the detailed experimental settings.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use the statistical significance in the evaluation metrics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

18


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have described the computer resource in the experimental settings.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: There is no concern about ethics involved in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no concern about broader impacts involved in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

19


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: There is no concern about safeguards involved in this work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We credit all works cited including dataset, code and model in the references.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide new asserts in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
