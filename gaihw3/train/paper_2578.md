Abstract

Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various
downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the speci-
ficity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering.
Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gra-
dient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However,
these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training
and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper
introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce
a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective
prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich
in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model
(LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which
enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for
the creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance,
while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets
reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based
prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the
generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that
the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency
and oversight for vision-language models.

Introduction

Vision-language models, trained on a diverse array of image-text pairs encapsulating a broad vo-
cabulary of real-world concepts [1, 2, 3], have demonstrated notable adaptability across various
downstream tasks [4, 5, 6, 7]. These models perform zero-shot image classification by filling in
a predefined prompt template (e.g., “a photo of a [CLASS]”) with specific class names for the
text encoder. Despite their effective generalization to new tasks, the performance can be influenced
by minor changes in the wording of prompt templates [8]. Instead of manually creating hand-
crafted prompts, recent developments in natural language processing [9, 10] and computer vision
[8, 11, 12, 13] have proposed methods to learn a set of soft prompts with minimal labeled data.
Despite the strides made in learning prompts, the current state of the art remains limited by its lack of
interpretability and the overfitting problems on the base classes, which can be prohibitive in diverse
and dynamic application environments. These limitations underscore the need for a more adaptable
and user-friendly approach to prompt optimization in vision-language models.

Drawing from recent advancements in using large language models (LLMs) as optimization tools [14],
our paper, for the first time, incorporates these capabilities into vision-language modeling. Unlike
gradient descent-based methods [8, 11, 13], which often fail to provide explanations for the generated

Prompt Optimization Prompt

Figure 1: Comparison between traditional gradient-based prompt optimization (a) and our interpretable prompt
optimization (b) for vision-language models. Traditional gradient descent-based prompt learning methods [8, 11]
treat the text prompt as learnable parameters V . By minimizing the loss through gradient descent on the training
set, an optimized prompt ˆV is obtained after I iterations, which is not interpretable by humans. In contrast, our
interpretable prompt optimization leverages an LLM as optimizer to optimize the loss and accuracy. After I
iterations, the resulting optimized top prompt is effective and human-readable.

prompts and tend to overfit on base classes, natural language-based methods enable LLMs to develop
and refine solutions through continuous feedback iteratively. This approach improves interpretability
in complex tasks like prompt optimization for vision-language models, making it easier for humans
to understand the generated prompts. However, existing research on these methods [14, 15, 16]
primarily addresses language tasks and has not yet explored their potential for integrating prompt
optimization with an LLM in vision-language models.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO) for vision-
language models that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to generate and refine text prompts dy-
namically. First, we design a Prompt Optimization Prompt to prompt LLMs to generate more
effective prompts that improve the accuracy of CLIP and reduce the loss in base classes. Our
Prompt Optimization Prompt also stores past prompts along with their corresponding accuracy
and loss as episodic memory, thereby providing richer in-context information to enable LLMs to
generate more effective prompts. Second, to incorporate image information within the Prompt
Optimization Prompt, we propose using a large multimodal model (LMM) to generate descrip-
tions of images in base classes that can be added to the Prompt Optimization Prompt. This in-
tegration facilitates a more intuitive interaction between the textual and visual modalities, which
allows the Prompt Optimization Prompt to utilize image information, thereby generating dataset-
specific prompts to enhance the generalization performance of CLIP. The framework of our IPO,
illustrated in Figure 1, showcases the comparison between traditional gradient-based prompt opti-
mization and the proposed interpretable prompt optimization. Third, the prompts generated by
our optimizer are human-interpretable. For example, on the Food101 dataset [17], the initial
prompt evolves from [“a photo of a [CLASS]”] to [“Categorize the image depicting a
delicious and appetizing <CLASS> with remarkable visual qualities.”]. Our gen-
erated prompts perform 10.29% better in novel classes than the gradient-based method CoOP [8],
reducing overfitting while maintaining interpretability.

We validated our IPO across 11 different datasets, demonstrating that it surpasses traditional gradient-
based state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and excels in interpretability. Our approach generates
human-comprehensible prompts that can be seamlessly integrated into existing vision-language
models to enhance performance. We conducted rigorous comparative experiments to quantify the
interpretability between gradient-based prompt learning and our method. We demonstrated the
importance of specific keywords in our generated prompts and revealed that not all tokens learned
through traditional prompt learning methods are essential.

Prompt learning in vision-language models. Prompt learning, originally introduced in the natural
language processing community [18, 19, 20], involves applying a fixed function to input tokens
to provide task instructions to the model. In the computer vision community, prompt learning has
been explored in various forms, including textual prompt tuning [8, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24], and prefix
tuning [13, 12, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. 1) Prompt tuning mainly involves treating text prompts as learnable
parameters, using a small amount of data to fine-tune these parameters. As pioneered by CoOp [8]

2


---Page Break---
and CoCoOp [11], which both fine-tune a CLIP vision-language model [30] for few-shot transfer
by optimizing a continuous set of prompt vectors within its language branch. Bayesian prompt
learning [21] formulated prompt learning as a variational inference problem and demonstrated its
ability for unseen class generalization. 2) Prefix tuning primarily involves adding learnable tokens to
the text encoder [31], vision encoder [12, 25], or both encoders [13, 27, 28, 32]. These tokens are
fine-tuned using a small amount of data. Note that these methods do not optimize the initial text
prompts. Instead, they focus on enhancing the model’s understanding capabilities by integrating these
additional, trainable tokens. Our method belongs to prompt tuning, but unlike previous approaches
that use gradient descent to optimize prompts, we propose using LLMs to optimize prompts. Our
method leverages the natural language capabilities of LLMs to iteratively refine feedback-based
prompts, aiming to enhance both the effectiveness and the explainability of the prompts.

LLMs as prompt optimizers. Several recent works explore the role of LLMs as prompt optimizers
for NLP tasks. Some use LLMs to directly optimize the task instruction for in-context learning [33,
34, 14]. Other studies use LLMs to mutate prompts for evolutionary algorithms [35, 36]. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no existing studies have investigated how LLMs could be used to optimize
text prompts within vision-language models. This approach could potentially open up new avenues
for integrating and enhancing the capabilities of vision-language models through more effective and
contextually appropriate text prompts.

Meta-prompting. Suzgun and Kalai [37] introduce meta-prompting to transform a single LLM into
a versatile “conductor” capable of managing and integrating multiple independent LLM queries.
By using high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LLM in decomposing complex tasks
into smaller subtasks. The core of OPRO [14] involves designing a meta-prompt for LLMs to
optimize prompts for each task. This meta-prompt includes two key pieces of information: previously
generated prompts with their corresponding training accuracies and a description of the optimization
problem. Self-select [38] leverages meta-prompting to optimize instruction selection. It considers
a set of provided templates and chooses the most suitable template. Meta-prompting is related to
instruction tuning [39] as both techniques provide high-level guidance to improve the performance
and adaptability of LLMs. However, while instruction tuning focuses on fine-tuning models with
a variety of tasks to improve generalization, meta-prompting offers the advantage of dynamically
guiding the model to decompose and manage complex tasks in real-time. Liu et al. [40] proposes a
method that utilizes LLMs as black-box optimizers for vision-language models, iteratively refining
prompts based on in-context examples. Their approach focuses on leveraging ChatGPT to improve
prompt templates for visual classification tasks. Mirza et al. [41] explores a different aspect of prompt
optimization by focusing on zero-shot vision-language models. Our Prompt Optimization Prompt
is akin to meta-prompting, it stores past prompts along with their corresponding accuracy and loss,
thereby providing richer in-context information to enable LLMs to generate more effective prompts.
Different from prior meta-prompting, our Prompt Optimization Prompt generates prompts beyond
LLMs for vision-language models.

Preliminaries

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). The goal of CLIP [30] is to develop an image
encoder fI and a text encoder gT via contrastive pre-training with a large collection of paired images
and captions. This process aims to map image-text pairs to a common semantic space. After the
pre-training phase, CLIP is able to perform zero-shot visual recognition by treating classification
as a task of matching images to text. Specifically, the placeholder term “[CLASS]” is used within a
prompt template (e.g., “a photo of a [CLASS]”) for the text encoder gT . Here, gT (Ti) denotes
the text features adapted for class i, and the probability of classifying class i from an image I is:

p(y=i|I)=
exp(⟨gT (Ti), fI(I)⟩/τ)
PK
j=1 exp(⟨gT (Tj), fI(I)⟩/τ)
,
(1)

where ⟨gT (Ti), fI(I)⟩represents the cosine similarity between the image feature fI(I) and the text
feature gT (Ti) specific to the i-th class, K is the total number of classes, and τ is the temperature
parameter that is tuned during training.

Prompt learning improves the adaptability of the CLIP model by eliminating the need for man-
ual prompt engineering. It facilitates the automatic generation of prompts using a limited number
of examples from a downstream task. CoOp [8] presents a method where a set of M continu-

3


---Page Break---
ous context vectors V ={v1, v2, . . . , vM} serve as the learnable prompt. The constructed prompt
Ti={v1, v2, . . . , vM, ci} merges these learnable context vectors V with the class-specific token
embedding ci, which is then processed by the text encoder gT (·). In CoOp, the optimization of these
static context vectors V aims to minimize the negative log-likelihood for the correct class token:

LCE(V )= −
X

i
yi log p(Ti|I),
(2)

here, yi represents the one-hot encoded ground-truth label for class i. In downstream applications,
the pre-trained model parameters are kept unchanged, which allows the learnable prompt vectors V
to be optimized efficiently using only a small number of samples through the minimization of the
cross-entropy loss.

Methods

Figure 1 depicts the comprehensive structure of our interpretable prompt optimizer. At each step of
the optimization, the LLM generates candidate prompts for the vision-language task by considering
both the description of the optimization problem and the feedback from previously evaluated prompts
stored in the Prompt Optimization Prompt. These new prompts are then assessed and incorporated
into the Prompt Optimization Prompt for future optimization cycles. The optimization process
concludes either when the LLM can no longer generate prompts that improve the optimization scores,
or when a predefined maximum number of optimization steps is reached. Next, we will detail the
design of the Prompt Optimization Prompt and explain how image information is integrated into the
Prompt Optimization Prompt.

Prompt Optimization Prompt design
At the core of our optimizer is the design of the Prompt
Optimization Prompt, which enhances the performance of the vision-language model by optimizing
the prompts through the prompt LLM. Figure 2 shows an example of our Prompt Optimization Prompt.
Our Prompt Optimization Prompt consists of the following components: (1) Instructions: These
guide the LLM by clearly defining its task to optimize the prompt for achieving better performance
in classification tasks. (2) Textual descriptions of training images: These descriptions provide the
LLM with detailed information about the images, enabling it to generate dataset-specific prompts.
(3) Previously generated prompts and corresponding scores: This component supplies in-context
information, including past prompts and their performance metrics, allowing the LLM to refine its
prompt generation more accurately. By incorporating these elements, our approach leverages the
iterative refinement capabilities of LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize text prompts. The
instructions ensure that the LLM understands the optimization goal, the textual descriptions offer rich
image-related context, and the historical data aids in producing more effective and precise prompts.

Textual descriptions of training images
For the textual descriptions of training images, we utilize
a large multimodal model (LMM) to generate text descriptions for each training image. Specifically,
we employ MiniCPM-V-2.0 [43] to generate descriptions of the content of images from base classes.
In the appendix, we provide content descriptions for some images from each dataset generated using
MiniCPM-V-2.0. We denote the extracted image textual features as fM(·).

Additionally, we have attempted to directly optimize prompts using the LMM with the Prompt Opti-
mization Prompt. Specifically, we input images from the base classes and the Prompt Optimization
Prompt into the LMM, aiming for the LMM to generate better prompts. We experimented with six
different LMMs: BLIP-2 [44], Qwen-VL-Chat-9.6B [45], FUYU-8B [46], MiniCPM-V-2.0 [43], and
llava-llama3-8B [47]. Unfortunately, all six models failed to understand our Prompt Optimization
Prompt and generated new prompts that were merely descriptions of the images, not the universal
prompts we desired. This failure might be due to the fact that the training of these LMMs did not
consider such a task. Note that image descriptions are not mandatory. In our 16-shot experiments,
we omitted the image descriptions in the Prompt Optimization Prompt due to the limited text input
length that the LLM can handle.

Episodic memory retrieval
We utilize an episodic memory mechanism to retrieve past prompts
and their corresponding scores, which include metrics such as loss and accuracy. Here, we denote
the memory as M. During each iteration, we retrieve the top-20 prompts R(M), based on their
accuracy from M and use them as the current memory, denoted as m. Moreover, we consistently
include the prompt “a photo of <CLASS>” in our history at every step, as this is a frequently used

Experiments

5.1
Experimental setup

We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the base-to-new generalization benchmark for
evaluating prompt learning in vision-language models [8, 11]. Across all experiments, we benchmark
the models’ performance in a 1-shot and commonly used 16-shot setting. To ensure consistency, all
results from learning-based methods are averaged over three random seeds. We use the harmonic
mean (H) as the average metric, which is a common approach in prompt learning for vision-language
models.

Eleven Datasets. We follow CLIP [30] and CoOp [8] to use 11 image classification datasets, i.e.,
ImageNet [48] and Caltech101 [49] for generic object classification, OxfordPets [50], Stanford-
Cars [51], Flowers102 [52], Food101 [17] and FGVCAircraft [53] for fine-grained image recognition,
EuroSAT [54] for satellite image classification, UCF101 [55] for action classification, DTD [42] for
texture classification, and SUN397 [56] for scene recognition.

Six Baselines. To conduct a comparative evaluation, we utilize a number of established baselines
including CLIP [30], Coop [8], CoCoOp [11], MaPLe [13], PromptSRC [28], and CoPrompt [32].
Note that all methods do not present 1-shot results in their publications, so we perform 1-shot
experiments using their available code.

Training details. We use GPT-3.5 Turbo as our default optimizer, iterating 100 steps for each dataset
to derive the final prompt. At each step, we generate five prompts and compare their accuracy with past
prompts, storing the top-20 prompts in our history. Ultimately, we select the prompt with the highest
accuracy as the final prompt. For generating image descriptions, we employ MiniCPM-V-2.0 [43]
as the default LMM, using the prompt: “[Please generate the description in detail,
do not provide the class name in the description.]”. We added image descriptions
to the 1-shot Prompt Optimization Prompt but not to the 16-shot version due to the character
input limitations of GPT-3.5 Turbo, which prevent adding detailed information for each class’s
images. All experiments were conducted on a GeForce RTX 3090. Our code is available at https:
//github.com/lmsdss/IPO.

5.2
Results

Interpretable prompt analysis. To analyze the importance of specific words or phrases in text
prompts, we display a comparative experiment on the Flower102 dataset. Specifically, in Table 1a,
we use “a photo of a <CLASS>” as the prompt, which is the most commonly utilized format. By
employing occlusion sensitivity analysis, we individually remove each word to test the importance of
the remaining words. We find that using just “<CLASS>” as the prompt performs only 0.89% lower
on the novel classes than “a photo of a <CLASS>”, indicating that the CLIP model can generate
more discriminative features using just the category name. Additionally, the prompt “a photo
<CLASS>.” achieves the best performance. By comparing “<CLASS>” with “photo <CLASS>”, we
determine that the word photo is particularly significant on the novel classes.

In Table 1b, we present the results of the CoOP and CoCoOP models when some learned prompt
tokens are removed to analyze which token is most crucial. Surprisingly, for both models, performance
improves in novel classes when some or all tokens are removed. This indicates severe overfitting in
base classes by these models, where the learned tokens are only applicable to base classes. Removing
all tokens allows the models to retain some of the original performance of CLIP on novel classes.
Additionally, these methods, which only learn tokens, make it challenging for humans to understand
the specific meanings of each token, complicating interpretation.

In Table 1c, we also demonstrate the final prompt produced by our model: “Identify the unique visual
features of the <CLASS> flower accurately,” which achieves a performance of 79.6%, surpassing the
original CLIP by 2.9% on novel classes. When comparing this optimal prompt with others, removing
any words from it results in worse performance than the original prompt. Specifically, comparing
“Identify <CLASS>” with “<CLASS>” reveals that including "Identify" boosts performance by
1.7% on novel classes. This highlights the importance of the word “Identify” in datasets like
Flower102. We have included additional analyses on various datasets in the appendix.

Overall, the comparative experiments demonstrate that our prompt can be more easily interpreted
and understood by humans, while also providing insights into the significance of certain key words

in the prompt. This understanding can guide us in identifying crucial words that enhance prompt
effectiveness.

Effect of LLM and LMM choice. In Table 2, we analyze the effect of the choice of the LLM
optimizer and LMM for generating image descriptions as Prompt Optimization Prompt inputs. We
evaluate various models and report their average performance across 11 datasets. Using GPT-3.5-
turbo as the optimizer results in better prompt generation, especially improving performance on novel
classes. The training speed of our IPO is heavily influenced by the computational efficiency of LLMs
used. Since PaLM and GPT-3.5 are not open-source, we rely on their respective APIs to generate
prompts. Consequently, our training speed depends on the API call latency and the computational
complexity of these models. Alternatively, Phi2 and Phi3 are open-source, allowing us to generate
prompts directly using their weights. Therefore, for researchers and practitioners seeking faster and
more cost-effective training, we recommend utilizing open-source large models for prompt generation.
When comparing different LMMs, we found that LLaVA-Llama-3-8B and MiniCPM-V-2.0 perform

almost identically on average. However, MiniCPM-V-2.0 shows better performance on novel classes.
Before using LLMs, we first use LMMs to generate image descriptions, which are then used as
inputs for the LLMs. In terms of computation cost, MiniCPM-V-2.0, with its smaller parameter size,
generates descriptions more quickly. Therefore, we recommend this lightweight LMM as the image
description generator for more efficient processing. In summary, the text comprehension capabilities
of LLMs are crucial for determining the quality of the optimized prompts.

Interpretable prompts generated per dataset. Table 3 showcases the diverse prompts generated by
our optimizer for each dataset. Our method enhances model accuracy by concentrating on the most
relevant attributes, such as those in Flowers102 [52] and Food101 [17]. Consequently, it delivers
high-quality text prompts that improve vision-language models. We encourage future researchers to
leverage these interpretable prompts in their own downstream tasks.

into the Prompt Optimization Prompt on the performance of the optimizer. The inclusion of image

descriptions enhances the model’s performance. This improve-
ment suggests that IPO, when generating new prompts, can ef-
fectively integrate information from the images themselves. As
a result, the optimizer is able to produce prompts that are more
specific to the data, thereby increasing the relevance and accu-
racy of the generated content. This highlights the importance
of multimodal inputs in optimizing the prompting abilities of
vision-language models.

Comparison with knowledge bank-based prompt learning methods. Our IPO leverages LLMs to
optimize prompts, which conceptually aligns with previous bank-based prompt learning approaches.
To assess its relative effectiveness, we compared IPO to traditional bank-based methods, specifically
using L2P [57], which learns to dynamically prompt (L2P) a pre-trained model to learn tasks
sequentially under different task transitions. We apply L2P within the visual prompt tuning (VPT) [12]
framework, which also learns prompts in the visual space and applies them to few-shot vision-

learning. Except for CLIP, the results for other methods are based on our reimplementation of their official code.
Our proposed IPO exhibits robust generalization capability and achieves significant improvements on novel
classes across 11 datasets.

L2P’s efficacy in the VLM domain, our IPO method still demonstrates superior results compared to
VPT + L2P. This comparison, which we will include in the revised manuscript, reinforces that IPO
’s effectiveness is not merely due to a memory retrieval mechanism but also benefits from prompt
optimization through LLMs.

ods do not perform as well as CLIP in novel classes, indicat-
ing overfitting to base classes. For instance, CoCoOP [11]
performs better in base classes but falls behind the origi-
nal CLIP by 2.05% in novel classes. In particular, on the
most challenging FGVCAircraft [53], and EuroSAT [54]
dataset, the current state-of-the-art model, CoPrompt [32],
performs poorly. This is because methods based on prefix-
tuning, like CoPrompt [32], PromptSRC [28], require
substantial amounts of data for training to achieve ade-
quate generalization. Consequently, on more challenging

second-best by 1.78% in harmonic mean. Additionally, in Table 7, we compared our method’s
performance with other traditional gradient-based prompt learning methods on a 16-shot setting
across all datasets, where our approach consistently performs well in novel classes. Demonstrating
that our approach can mitigate overfitting and generalize better to novel classes.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to prompt optimization for vision-language models,
addressing the limitations of existing gradient-descent-based methods. By integrating large language
models for dynamic text prompt generation and optimization, we introduced the IPO system. This
system guides LLMs in crafting effective prompts while maintaining a record of past prompts and
their performance metrics, offering valuable in-context information. Additionally, we incorporated
large multimodal models to generate image descriptions, enhancing the synergy between textual and
visual modalities. Our comprehensive evaluation across 11 datasets demonstrated that our method
improves the initial accuracy of vision-language models compared to traditional gradient-descent-
based prompt learning methods. Most notably, our approach significantly enhances the interpretability
of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, IPO ensures that the prompts remain
human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language
models. This improvement in interpretability is crucial, as it allows for more effective and trustworthy
human-AI collaboration, making vision-language systems more reliable and accessible.

Limitation. Our IPO method is primarily designed for few-shot scenarios. However, when dealing
with large domain-specific datasets, the need to generate extensive image descriptions, which can
lead to substantial computational costs due to the large text inputs required for LLMs. Currently, our
model uses an input length of approximately 5,000 tokens. When scaled to larger datasets, the input
length may increase to around 50,000 tokens. Using GPT-4 with an 8k context length, the cost for
our current input size (5,000 tokens) is approximately 0.15 dollars per input (0.03 dollars per 1,000
tokens). For the expanded input size of 50,000 tokens, the cost would rise to approximately 3.00
dollars per input. If we were to use GPT-4 with a 32k context length, the cost for the 50,000-token
input would be approximately 3.00 dollars for the first 32,000 tokens and an additional 1.08 dollars
for the remaining 18,000 tokens, totaling approximately 4.08 dollars per input. Since our IPO method
requires 100 iterations during training, the costs would multiply accordingly when scaled to large
inputs. In future work, we aim to investigate methods for LMM fine-tuning to enable the direct input
of both images and text, thereby generating even more sample-specific prompts.

Broader Impact. This paper explores the use of an LLM as an optimizer for refining text prompts
in vision-language models. We introduce a straightforward yet interpretable approach to prompt
optimization, which holds potential for societal impact, particularly in vision-language tasks.

C
Impact of LLM

As demonstrated in Table 10, upgrading the LLM capacity yielded a similarly positive impact on
performance. To explore how a more advanced LLM, like GPT-4, could generate more effective
prompts for our model, we conducted additional experiments with both GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Specifi-
cally, when we enhanced the LLM to GPT-4o and paired it with the GPT-4o LMM, we observed a
significant overall increase in the H-score by 1.77% compared to the initial setup using GPT-3.5-turbo
alongside MiniCPM-V-2. This improvement underscores the advantages of employing larger, more
capable models, as they facilitate greater task generalization and more robust performance. The
findings suggest that scaling up model capacity in both the LMM and LLM components can lead
to substantial gains in prompt quality and adaptability across various tasks, indicating a promising
direction for further enhancing our model’s versatility and effectiveness.

D
Experiments on Segmentation Task with IPO

In prompt-based vision tasks like segmentation and detection, the design of the text prompt plays
a pivotal role. Our task-agnostic method, IPO, can be seamlessly integrated into various vision
tasks to optimize text prompts. For example, as shown in Table 13, we applied IPO to pre-trained
semantic segmentation models [58, 59], where the original prompt used was ’a photo of a [CLASS].’
By utilizing GPT-4o as both the LLM and LMM, we generated more effective, context-specific
text prompts tailored to the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation task, leading to significant
performance improvements. These results highlight the potential of IPO to enhance text prompt
design in segmentation tasks, showcasing its adaptability and value. We plan to extend our exploration
of IPO to other vision tasks in future studies, aiming to further validate its effectiveness in optimizing
prompt construction across a broader range of applications.

IPO with GPT-3.5 Turbo, indeed, does not show an improvement on the large-scale ImageNet. This
is because ImageNet has a large number of classes and samples, which results in longer LLM input
when generating descriptions for each sample. GPT-3.5 Turbo has limited performance in handling
long-text inputs. The table 12 shows the results on ImageNet when IPO uses GPT-4o, which has
superior long-text understanding compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo. We found that IPO using GPT-4o leads
to better performance improvements over other methods as well as a considerable improvement over
IPO with GPT-3.5 Turbo.

E
Experiments on segmentation task with IPO

In other prompt-based vision tasks, such as segmentation and detection, the design of the text prompt
is crucial. Our method, being task-agnostic, can be easily embedded into any vision task to optimize

the text prompt. For instance, as shown in Table 13, we incorporated IPO into pre-trained semantic
segmentation models [58, 59], where the original text prompt was "a photo of a [CLASS]." Using
GPT-4o as the LLM and LMM, we crafted more effective text prompts specifically suited to the
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation task, leading to enhanced performance and demonstrating
the value of IPO in optimizing text prompts for this application. We intend to further investigate the
use of IPO in other vision tasks in future work.

F
Effect of batch size

The Table 14 compares the performance of GPT-3.5 turbo and GPT-4o across different batch sizes. We
observed that as the batch size increases to 128, GPT-3.5 turbo’s performance begins to decline due to
its limited capacity for handling longer input texts effectively. In contrast, GPT-4o maintains strong
performance even at larger batch sizes. However, using extremely large batch sizes with GPT-4o
becomes cost-prohibitive. Therefore, we selected a batch size of 128 for our experiments. Although

even larger batch sizes could potentially improve performance further, the cost considerations become
a critical factor.

G
Impact of prompt history length

We evaluated the effect of varying prompt history lengths on model performance, as shown in
Table 15. Our findings indicate that without prompt history, performance declines due to the absence
of contextual information, making it challenging for the LLM to converge. As the history length
increases, performance progressively improves, with convergence observed at n=20. Although using
n=100 yields the highest average performance, the extended input length significantly raises API
costs. As a result, we selected n=20 for our IPO, balancing performance gains with cost efficiency.

we present the optimization process’s loss and accuracy on ImageNet in Figure 9. As the training
steps increase, the loss consistently decreases, and the accuracy gradually improves, proving the
optimization capability of IPO. Additionally, IPO not only allows for interpretable prompt generation
but also reduces the risk of overfitting during training.

Prompt Optimization Prompt design

Our Prompt Optimization Prompt is a crucial component of our optimizer, serving to enhance the
performance of the vision-language model by optimizing the prompts through the prompt LLM.
Figure 2 displays an example of our Prompt Optimization Prompt. Initially, the instruction in the
first segment of the Prompt Optimization Prompt defines the role of the LLM. It introduces two
essential tokens, <INS> and <CLASS>, which represent the prompt and category, respectively.
The primary function of this instruction is to inform the LLM of its role and the contents of the
Prompt Optimization Prompt, enabling a more effective understanding of the Prompt Optimization
Prompt. Note that in this section, our model does not involve image information, hence the Prompt
Optimization Prompt here lacks statements like “Here is a description of some features of the flowers

to integrate image information into the Prompt Optimization Prompt.

The subsequent instruction concerns the history of the prompts and their associated scores, which
include metrics such as loss and accuracy. Our task follows CoOP [8], focusing on base classes
with few samples. We calculate the loss and accuracy for these base classes using the generated
prompts. Initially, we inform the LLM that the following details are past prompts along with their
scores, and we clarify the range of values for loss and accuracy. What follows are the historical
prompts and scores. This history functions similarly to episodic memory, to prevent the generation
of suboptimal prompts while providing in-context information that enhances the creation of better
prompts. Additionally, as the history of past prompts grows, we only retain the top 20 prompts based
on accuracy to avoid information overload. The selection of these top 20 prompts is determined by
their accuracy scores. Moreover, we consistently include the prompt “a photo of <CLASS>” in our
history at every step, as this is a frequently used and effective prompt within the CLIP framework [30].

The final paragraph of the instruction specifies the ultimate goal of the task: to generate improved
prompts based on the aforementioned instructions and the history of past prompts. The aim is to
achieve lower loss and higher accuracy in this vision-language task, and it also outlines the format
for the final generated prompt. These three components constitute the entire content of the Prompt
Optimization Prompt, each playing a critical role for the LLM. It is important to note that in this
Prompt Optimization Prompt, we do not consider the specific content of the images; we merely use
images to calculate scores, and the details of the images are overlooked. In the following section,
we will utilize a LMM to generate content from images and then incorporate it into the Prompt
Optimization Prompt.

More occlusion sensitivity analysis

In Tables 19-29, we present various prompts analyzed using occlusion sensitivity analysis across
different models and datasets. We found that CLIP is particularly sensitive to photos. However,
CoOP and CoCoOP exhibit severe overfitting on base classes, leading to poor performance on base
classes when some tokens are removed, but improved performance on novel classes. In contrast, our
optimized prompts show performance degradation to varying degrees when certain words or phrases
are removed, indicating that the key words or phrases in our generated prompts are essential.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The contributions and scope of this paper are claimed in the abstract. Detailed
information can be found in the fourth paragraph of the introduction section 1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide a "limitation" subsection in the conclusion section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

37


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all experimental details in the experiment section. The detailed
input and output of Prompt Optimization Prompt of our method can be found in Appendix
and supplemental materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

38


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide all experimental details in the experiment section. The detailed
Prompt Optimization Prompt and Python codes of our method can be found in Appendix
and supplemental materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We follow the standard experimental setup in IPO, where the data splits, is set
as the same as previous works CoOP [8] and CoCoOP [11]. Detailed information can be
found in Sec. 5
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Following the standard experimental setup, we repeat each experiment over 3
random seeds and report the mean of the results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

39


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the computing resources in experiments 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We reviewed and followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the potential broader impacts in the conclusion section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

40


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The data and models pose no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original papers that produced the code package and datasets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

41


---Page Break---
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Details of the datasets/code/model are provided in the supplemental materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
