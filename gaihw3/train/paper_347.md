Abstract

Video diffusion models have made substantial progress in various video generation
applications. However, training models for long video generation tasks require
significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long
video diffusion models. This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free
approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g., pre-trained on
16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g., 128 frames). Our
preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion
model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further
investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of
high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial
high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency compo-
nents. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance
the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process.
FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which
encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of
local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach
maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spa-
tiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity
of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion
models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports
coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless
transitions between scenes. Our project page is at: https://yulu.net.cn/freelong.

Introduction

Video diffusion models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] trained on vast video-text datasets [8, 9] have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos. Inspired by Sora [10], multiple studies [11,
12, 13] have concentrated on training these models to create longer videos using extensive, long
video-text datasets [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, these methods demand significant computational
resources and data annotations.

A more practical approach involves adapting pre-trained short video models to generate consistent
longer video sequences without retraining. Recent research [19, 20] has explored sliding window
temporal attention to ensure smooth transitions between video clips in the generation of long videos.
Nonetheless, these techniques often struggle to maintain global temporal consistency across extended
sequences and require multiple passes of temporal attention.

In this study, we propose a simple, training-free method to adapt existing short video diffusion models
(e.g., pretrained on 16 frames) for generating consistent long videos (e.g., 128 frames). Initially,

Figure 1: Results of Short and Long Videos. The first row of each case shows 16-frame videos
generated using short video diffusion models (LaVie [1] and VideoCrafter2 [2]). Directly extending
these models to longer videos, like those with 128 frames, preserves temporal consistency but lacks
fine spatial-temporal details. In contrast, our proposed FreeLong adapts short video diffusion models
to create consistent long videos with high fidelity.

we examine the direct application of short video diffusion models for long video generation. As
depicted in Figure 1, straightforwardly using a 16-frame video diffusion model to produce 128-frame
sequences yields globally consistent yet low-quality results.

To delve further into these issues, we conducted a frequency analysis of the generated long videos.
As shown in Figure 2 (a), the low-frequency components remain stable as the video length increases,
while the high-frequency components exhibit a noticeable decline, leading to a drop in video quality.
The findings indicate that although the overall temporal structure is preserved, fine-grained details
suffer notably in longer sequences. Specifically, there is a decrease in high-frequency spatial
components (Figure 2 (b)) and an increase in high-frequency temporal components (Figure 2 (c)).
This high-frequency distortion poses a challenge in maintaining high fidelity over extended sequences.
As illustrated in the middle row of each case in Figure 1, intricate textures like forest paths or sunrises
become blurred and less defined, while temporal flickering and sudden changes disrupt the video’s
narrative flow.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce FreeLong, a novel framework that employs SpectralBlend
Temporal Attention (SpectralBlend-TA) to balance the frequency distribution of long video features
in the denoising process. SpectralBlend-TA integrates global and local features via two parallel
streams, enhancing the fidelity and consistency of long video generation. The global stream deals
with the entire video sequence, capturing extensive dependencies and themes for narrative continu-
ity. Meanwhile, the local stream focuses on shorter frame subsequences to retain fine details and
smooth transitions, preserving high-frequency spatial and temporal information. SpectralBlend-TA
combines global and local video features in the frequency domain, improving both consistency and
fidelity by blending low-frequency global components with high-frequency local components. Our
method is entirely training-free and allows for the easy integration of FreeLong into existing video
diffusion models by adjusting the original temporal attention of video diffusion models. Comparative

applying our method to generate long video sequences.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) We conduct a frequency analysis on the
direct application of short video models for longer video generation and identify high-frequency
distortions in the longer videos. 2) We devise a SpectralBlend Temporal Attention mechanism
to merge the consistent low-frequency components of global videos with the high-fidelity high-
frequency components of local videos. 3) Our training-free approach, FreeLong, outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models in both temporal consistency and video fidelity.

Related Work

Text-to-Video Diffusion Models: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has progressed significantly from
early variational autoencoders [21, 22] and GANs [23] to advanced diffusion-based techniques [3,
4, 24, 25, 26], marking a major leap in synthesis methods. Modern video diffusion models build
on pre-trained image-to-text diffusion models [27, 28, 29], incorporating temporal transformers
in the diffusion UNet to capture temporal relationships. These models achieve impressive video
generation results through post-training on video-text data [14, 9, 8, 1], enhancing coherence and
fidelity. However, due to computational constraints and limited dataset availability, current video
diffusion models are typically trained on fixed-length short videos (e.g., 16 frames), limiting their
ability to produce longer videos. In this paper, we propose extending these short video diffusion
models to generate long and consistent videos without requiring any additional training videos.

Long-video Generation: Generating long videos is challenging due to temporal complexity, resource
constraints, and the need for content consistency. Recent advancements focus on improving temporal
coherence and visual quality using GAN-based [30, 31] and diffusion-based techniques [32, 33, 34,
35, 36]. For instance, Nuwa-XL [36] employs a parallel diffusion process, while StreamingT2V [11]
uses an autoregressive approach with a short-long memory block to improve the consistency of
long video sequences. Despite their effectiveness, these methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale datasets. Recent research has explored training-free adaptations using short
video diffusion models for long video generation. Gen-L-Video [37] extends videos by merging
overlapping sub-segments with a sliding-window method during denoising. FreeNoise [19] employs
sliding-window temporal attention and a noise initialization strategy to maintain temporal consistency.
However, these approaches focus on smooth transitions between video clips and fail to capture global
consistency across long video sequences. This paper proposes FreeLong, a novel approach that
blends global and local video features during the denoising process to enhance both global temporal
consistency and visual quality in long video generation.

Observation and Analysis

When attempting to adapt short video diffusion models to generate long videos, a straightforward
approach is to input a longer noise sequence into the short video models. The temporal transformer
layers in the video diffusion model are not constrained by input length, making this method seemingly
viable. However, our empirical study reveals significant challenges, as demonstrated in Figure 1.
Generated long videos often exhibit fewer detailed textures, such as blurred forests in the background,
and more irregular variations, like abrupt changes in motion. We attribute these issues to two main
factors: the limitations of the temporal attention mechanism and the distortion of high-frequency
components.

Attention Mechanism Analysis: The temporal attention mechanism in video diffusion models is
pre-trained on fixed-length videos, which complicates its ability to generate longer videos. As shown
in Figure 3 , increasing video length hinders the temporal attention’s ability to accurately capture
frame-to-frame relationships. For 16-frame videos, the attention maps show a diagonal pattern,
indicating high correlations with adjacent frames that preserve spatial-temporal details and motion
patterns. In contrast, for 128-frame videos, the less structured attention maps suggest difficulty in
focusing on relevant information across distant frames, leading to missed subtle motion patterns and
over-smoothed or blurred generations.

Frequency Analysis: To better understand the generation process of long videos, we analyzed the
frequency components in videos of varying lengths using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as a

length increases. (b) In the spatial frequency domain, the SNR of high-frequency components
decreases even more substantially, resulting in the over-smoothing of each frame. (c) Conversely,
in the temporal frequency domain, the SNR of high-frequency components increases significantly,
introducing temporal flickering.

Figure 3: Temporal Attention Visualization. We visualize the temporal attention by average across
all layers and time steps from LaVie [1] and VideoCrafter [2]. The attention maps for 16-frame
videos exhibit a diagonal-like pattern, indicating a high correlation with adjacent frames, which
helps preserve high-frequency details and motion patterns when generating new frames. In contrast,
attention maps for longer videos are less structured, such as 128 frames, making the model struggle
to identify and attend to the relevant information across distant frames. This lack of structure in the
attention maps results in the distortion of high-frequency components of long videos, which results in
the degradation of fine spatial-temporal details.

metric. Ideally, short video diffusion models generate 16-frame videos with high quality, and robust
longer videos derived from such models should exhibit consistent SNR values across all frequency
components. However, Figure 2 reveals significant differences in the SNR of high/low frequency
components2 between generated short and long videos. The SNR of low-frequency components
remains relatively consistent for long videos (1.0 for 16 frames to 0.93 for 128 frames), suggesting
that the model maintains overall structure and low-frequency details in extended sequences. However,
the SNR of high-frequency components drops significantly for longer videos (1.0 for 16 frames to
0.73 for 128 frames), indicating a loss of fine details and increased distortion, leading to suboptimal
visual fidelity.

Further investigation into the spatial and temporal frequency domains revealed two key findings: (1)
In the spatial domain, the high-frequency components of long videos degrade significantly (0.68 for
128 frames), causing substantial degradation of spatial details in each frame and resulting in blurred
frames. (2) In the temporal domain, the high-frequency components increase with video length (1.5
for 128-frame videos), resulting in temporal flickering and incoherent video outputs.

2We split the frequency components into high-frequency (ϕ ∼(0.25π −1.00π)) and low-frequency
(ϕ ∼(0.00π −0.25π)) and compared the SNR of each component in long videos to the corresponding SNR in
16-frame videos.

Figure 4: Overview of FreeLong. FreeLong facilitates consistent and high-fidelity video generation
using SpectralBlend Temporal Attention (SpectralBlend-TA). SpectralBlend-TA effectively blends
low-frequency global video features with high-frequency local video features through a two-step
process: local-global attention decoupling and spectral blending. Local video features are obtained
by masking temporal attention to concentrate on fixed-length adjacent frames, while global temporal
attention encompasses all frames. During spectral blending, 3D FFT projects features into the
frequency domain, where high-frequency local components and low-frequency global components
are merged. The resulting blended feature, transformed back to the time domain via IFFT, is then
utilized in the subsequent block for refined video generation.

FreeLong: Training-free Long Video Generation

Motivated by the above analysis, we propose FreeLong, a method designed to generate high-fidelity
and consistent long videos using the inherent power of the diffusion model. As illustrated in Figure 4,
our FreeLong uses a diffusion UNet from pre-trained short video diffusion models and introduces
a SpectralBlend Temporal Attention (SpectralBlend-TA) to facilitate long video generation. The
SpectralBlend-TA consists of two steps: local-global attention decoupling and spectral blending.

Local-global Attention Decoupling:

The temporal attention in short video models is optimized to model short frame sequences accurately,
maintaining high-fidelity visual information. Conversely, the long-range temporal attention from short
video models tends to maintain overall layout and and object consistency. Given these properties, we
first decouple the local and global attention. The local attention matrix can be obtained as:

Alocal(i, j) =





Softmax

QiK⊤
j
√

d


if |i −j| ≤α

otherwise,
(1)

where Q and K are the query and key matrices derived from the input video feature Zin. The local
attention Alocal leads to each frame i only attending to frames within a window of 2α frames. Given
the local attention matrix Alocal, the local video features Zlocal can be obtained by: Zlocal = AlocalV ,
where V is the value matrix derived from the input video feature Zin. By restricting the temporal
attention to adjacent local frames, we preserve the capabilities of short video models, thereby retaining
high-fidelity visual details in local video features.

We then define the global attention matrix where each frame attends to all other frames. The global
attention matrix can be computed as follows:

Aglobal(i, j) = Softmax

 
QiK⊤

(2)

Given the global attention matrix Aglobal, the global video features Zglobal can be obtained by:
Zglobal = AglobalV . The global video features process the entire video sequence, ensuring narrative
continuity and coherence, while capturing long-range dependencies and overarching themes.

Spectral Blending: After obtaining the global and local video features, a frequency filter is used
to blend the low-frequency components of the global video latent Zglobal with the high-frequency
components of the local video latent Zlocal, resulting in a new video latent Z′. This fused latent
retains the global coherence and structure provided by Zglobal, while benefiting from the enhanced
high-frequency details introduced by Zlocal. The process is described by:

FL
zglobal = FFT3D(Zglobal) ⊙P,
(3)

FH
zlocal = FFT3D(Zlocal) ⊙(1 −P),
(4)

Z′ = IFFT3D(FL
zglobal + FH
zlocal)
(5)

where FFT3D is the Fast Fourier Transformation operated on both spatial and temporal dimensions,
IFFT3D is the Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation that maps back the blended representation Z′ from
the frequency domain, and P ∈R4×N×h×w is the spatial-temporal Low Pass Filter (LPF), which is
a tensor of the same shape as the latent. The final fused video feature Z′ serves as the input to our
subsequent video generation module.

The rationale behind using low-frequency components from the global video features and high-
frequency components from the local video features stems from our analysis. The global features
provide a stable, coherent structure, preserving the overall layout and object consistency throughout
the video. This is crucial for maintaining temporal consistency in long videos. On the other hand, local
features retain high-fidelity details, which are essential for capturing fine textures and intricate motion
patterns that tend to degrade in long sequences. By blending these components in the frequency
domain, we harness the strengths of both global consistency and local detail preservation, addressing
the issues of blurred frames and temporal flickering observed in our analysis.

Recent studies [38, 39] indicate that latent diffusion models [27] generate varying levels of visual
content at different stages of the denoising process: scene layout and object shapes in the early steps,
and fine details in the later steps. We propose fusing global and local video features in the early τ
steps of the denoising process and using local video features in the remaining steps. This fusion
ensures that the overall layout and object appearance of the generated long video follow the global
features, thereby maintaining temporal consistency in the generated videos.

Implementation Details

Baseline Models: To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method, we
apply FreeLong on two publicly available diffusion-based text-to-video models, LaVie [1] and
VideoCrafter [2]. These models are trained on short videos with fixed length (i.e., 16 frames), we
extend them to produce long videos (i.e., 128 frames [40]). We set α = 8 for the local attention
setting and set τ to 25. During inference, the parameters of the frequency filter for each model are
kept the same for a fair comparison. Specifically, we use a Gaussian Low Pass Filter (GLPF) PG
with a normalized spatiotemporal stop frequency of D0 = 0.25. Multi-prompt videos are generated
with random noise, and FreeNoise [19] is used for single-prompt long video generation.

Test Prompts: We chose 200 prompts from VBench [41] to validate the effectiveness of our method.

Evaluation Metrics: For text-to-video generation, we employed several metrics from VBench [41]
to evaluate two aspects: video consistency and video fidelity. For video consistency measurement,
we use two metrics: 1). Subject consistency, computed by the DINO [42] feature similarity across
frames to assess whether object appearance remains consistent throughout the whole video. 2).
Background consistency, calculated by CLIP [43] feature similarity across frames. For video fidelity
measurement, we use three metrics: 1). Motion smoothness, which utilizes the motion priors in the
video frame interpolation model AMT [44] to evaluate the smoothness of generated motions. 2).
Temporal flickering, which takes static frames and computes the mean absolute difference across
frames. 3). Imaging quality, calculated using the MUSIQ [45] image quality predictor trained on the
SPAQ [46] dataset.

5.2
Quantitative Comparison

We compare our FreeLong method with other training-free approaches for long video generation
using diffusion models. Our comparison includes three methods: (1) Direct sampling. It directly
samples 128 frames from the short video models. (2) Sliding window. It adopts temporal sliding
windows [20] to process a fixed number of frames at a time. (3) FreeNoise [19]. FreeNoise introduces
repeat input noise to maintain temporal coherence across long sequences.

Table 1 presents the quantitative results. Direct generation of long videos suffers from high-frequency
distortion, leading to significant quality degradation. This method results in low fidelity scores,
including imaging quality, temporal flickering, and motion smoothness. The sliding-window method
and FreeNoise show improved video quality thanks to the fixed effective temporal attention window

but still face challenges in maintaining consistency across long videos. Our FreeLong method
achieves the highest scores across all metrics, producing consistent long videos with high fidelity.
Moreover, we also examine the inference time of these methods on the NVIDIA A100. As delineated
in Table 1, our approach achieves a faster speed compared to preceding methods by employing
single-pass temporal attentions.

5.3
Qualitative Comparison

The synthesis results of each method are shown in Figure 5. In the first row, directly sampling 128
frames through a model trained on 16 frames will bring poor quality results due to the high-frequency
distortion. For example, the yacht (left) and the girl (right) have blurred and the background is
not clear. As shown in second row in Figure 5, using temporal sliding windows helps generate
more vivid videos, but this approach ignores long-range visual consistency, causing the subject and
background to appear significantly different across frames. FreeNoise attempts to promote global
consistency by repeating and shuffling the initial noise for each frame; however, it fails to maintain
long-range visual consistency and suffers from content mutations. In contrast, our method, FreeLong,
explicitly enforces global constraints during the denoising process, achieving temporal consistency
while preserving high fidelity across frames. Results shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that FreeLong
successfully renders temporal consistent longer videos, outperforming all other methods.

Ablation Studies

To validate the effectiveness of each module in our FreeLong method—global video feature, local
video feature, and our combined approach—we present the generated results by ablating each
component.

As shown in the top part of Figure 6, videos generated solely from global video features maintain
consistent content but suffer from severe fidelity degradation. Conversely, videos generated using
only local video features preserve fidelity due to the fixed effective temporal attention window but fail
to maintain temporal consistency, as evidenced by the changing color of the cow. Simply combining
global and local video features results in fidelity degradation because the high-frequency components
of the global video features degrade significantly.

In the bottom part of Figure 6, we show the videos generated by combining the low-frequency
components from global video features with the high-frequency components from local video
features. Our approach effectively combines the consistency of global videos with the high fidelity of
local videos, achieving both high fidelity and temporal consistency.

5.5
Multi-Prompt Video Generation

Our method can be seamlessly extended to multi-prompt video generation by providing different
prompts for each video segment. As illustrated in Figure 7, our approach ensures coherent visual
continuity and motion consistency. For instance, Ironman is shown running on the road, then standing,
and finally flying into the sky, all within a consistent scene and with smooth action transitions. In
the second row, we demonstrate a more complex prompt sequence describing weather and scene
transitions. Our method effectively models the transition from “sunrise" to “storm with heavy rain
and thunder" to the final “rainbow," maintaining consistency and capturing the fine-grained details of
each prompt transition.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced FreeLong, a training-free method to adapt short video diffusion models
for long video generation. Our research reveals that directly generating long videos from short video
diffusion models results in poor quality, primarily due to high-frequency distortion. To resolve this
issue, we employ the SpectralBlend Temporal Attention (SpectralBlend-TA) mechanism, which
blends low-frequency global features with high-frequency local features to enhance consistency
and fidelity in long videos. Our experiments demonstrate that FreeLong significantly outperforms
existing models, achieving superior temporal consistency and video fidelity. Our experiments show
that FreeLong significantly outperforms existing models, achieving better temporal consistency and
video fidelity. FreeLong also supports coherent multi-prompt generation, offering a practical solution
for high-quality long video creation without extensive retraining.

Appendix

A.1
Social Impacts

It is important to consider the potential ethical implications of our approach, which is typical in
generative models. By incorporating Video Diffusion Model [1, 2] into our methodology, there is a
chance that our system may also inherit the biases present in these models. Additionally, we need
to be aware of the potential risks, including the generation of deceptive, harmful, or discriminatory
content.

A.2
Limitation

Despite its significant advancements, FreeLong has several limitations. Temporal flickering can still
occur in extended sequences, affecting the visual consistency over prolonged videos. Additionally,
handling dynamic scene changes where context and content vary significantly remains challenging,
as the current model may struggle to adapt to rapidly changing scenarios. Nonetheless, FreeLong rep-
resents a promising approach to training-free long-form text-to-video generation, offering significant
improvements in consistency and fidelity despite these challenges.

video diffusion frameworks by replacing the temporal attention with SpectralBlend-TA, enabling
these models to generate consistent long videos with high fidelity.

A.5
Generalization to Other Base Models

Our FreeLong method is designed to be model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various
pre-trained short video diffusion models. To validate this, we apply FreeLong to other state-of-the-art
video diffusion frameworks beyond LaVie [1] and VideoCrafter [2]. Specifically, we incorporate
FreeLong into models like ModelScope [5], Animatediff [4] and OpenSora [48], replacing their
original temporal attention mechanisms with our proposed SpectralBlend Temporal Attention. As
illustrated in Figure 10, FreeLong successfully enhances these models’ capabilities to generate
consistent long videos with high fidelity. The generated videos maintain temporal coherence across
extended sequences while preserving fine-grained spatial-temporal details. The successful integration
and performance improvement across different models highlight the generalizability of our approach.
This flexibility allows researchers and practitioners to extend the capabilities of various short video
diffusion models without additional training.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We carefully described our contributions in the abstract and introduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the appendix, we discussed our limitations, societal impact, and directions
for future work.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

17


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper is not about theory.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provided details about the methodology and implementation in the main
paper and appendix. We also upload the main code as supplementary materials.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

18


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have released our code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We present the experimental setup and details in the main paper and appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: We do not report error bars.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

19


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We introduce the used computer resources in the main paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We carefully reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In the appendix, we discussed our limitations, societal impact, and directions
for future work.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cited related papers.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
