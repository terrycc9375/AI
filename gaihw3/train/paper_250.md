Abstract

Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance
in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-
scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models
often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction
Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By
processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as inde-
pendent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training
scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For
DRACO’s pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a
high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over
270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves
as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various
cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denois-
ing, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Introduction

Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in zero-shot and
few-shot tasks. These models learn to extract multi-purpose visual features from large-scale, diverse
datasets through text-guided [1, 2, 3] or self-supervised [4, 5] pre-training methods such as masked
image modeling (MIM) [6]. The features can then be applied to various downstream tasks. For
instance, DINOv2 [5] is trained on a large-scale curated dataset and shows significant performance
improvements in classification, retrieval, segmentation, etc. The success of vision foundation models
has stimulated advances across various scientific disciplines. Due to the diverse modalities of
scientific imaging, training domain-specific foundation models [7, 8, 9, 10] is essential to meet
specific demands. For example, the UNI [7] foundation model for tissue imaging is pre-trained on
100 million images for 34 representative clinical downstream tasks.

In structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) stands as a pivotal bio-imaging
technique [11]. Unlike optical imaging methods, cryo-EM possesses several distinctive characteristics:
first, cryo-EM utilizes high-energy electron beams as its illumination source [12] and direct detector

Figure 1: Overview of DRACO. For pre-training, we construct a large-scale curated dataset con-
taining 529 types of protein data with over 270,000 cryo-EM movies or micrographs. Based on this,
we present DRACO, a denoising-reconstruction autoencoder for cryo-EM. A pre-trained DRACO
naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation for various downstream
model adaptions such as micrograph curation and particle picking.

device (DDD) captures a continuous multi-frame sequence, often called a movie [13]. To mitigate
specimen damage during exposure, the electron dose per frame is restricted, leading to extremely low
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in the captured images. Second, cryo-EM employs motion correction
to counteract blurring induced by specimen drift during exposure to ultimately obtain a sharper
single micrograph [13]. Last, the acquired images comprise hundreds of thousands of target protein
particles with diverse poses. To resolve 3D structures, researchers utilize a pipeline composed of
multiple downstream tasks including micrograph curation, micrograph denoising, particle picking,
pose estimation, and ultimately high-resolution reconstruction.

In line with denoising autoencoders [14], which consider “robustness to partial destruction of the
input” a good representation criterion, existing self-supervised learning methods, such as masked au-
toencoders (MAE) [6], have been successful in learning expressive representations by reconstructing
the missing patches from a partially masked image. However, in cryo-EM, these methods overlook
the severe corruption caused by pixel-level random noise, leading to degraded performance. To be
more robust to noises, DMAE [15] reconstructs the clean image from the masked one that is further
corrupted by synthetic Gaussian noise. Nevertheless, cryo-EM clean reference images are impossible
to obtain due to the fragile biological specimens, posing a significant challenge.

In this paper, we present DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, as
shown in Figure 1. Inspired by Noise2Noise (N2N) [16], which learns to denoise images using
only paired noisy images, we divide the original movie into two sub-movies based on odd and even
frame numbers, processing them into odd and even images. We treat them as two independent,
noisy observations of the underlying true signal, thus the idea of N2N can apply. During training,
we partially mask both images, creating masked regions and unmasked regions corresponding to
denoising and reconstruction tasks: in the unmasked region, the odd noisy patch learns to recover the
even noisy patch, and vice versa. In the masked region, we introduce relatively low-noise images
from the complete movie to supervise the reconstructed results. This denoising-reconstruction hybrid
training scheme achieves the robust feature extraction of noisy cryo-EM images.

The quality of training samples is crucial for the general-purpose feature extraction of cryo-EM
images. Direct access to the public database leads to varying data quality, inconsistent data formats,
or missing annotations. Therefore, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse single-particle
cryo-EM image dataset by curating and manually processing 529 sets of data from EMPIAR [17],
obtaining over 270,000 cryo-EM movies or micrographs in total. After pre-training, DRACO naturally
serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation for various downstream model
adaptions. We hence explore the performance of DRACO on three downstream tasks: micrograph
curation, denoising, and particle picking. Extensive experiments show that DRACO outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines in all downstream tasks. We will release code, pre-trained/fine-tuned
models, and the large-scale curated dataset.

Related Work

Our work aims to extend the vision foundation model to the field of cryo-EM. We therefore only
discuss the most relevant works in respective fields.

Vision foundation models in computer vision. Vision foundation models are pre-trained on large-
scale image datasets [18, 19] using self-supervised learning methods [20], aimed at extracting general
visual signals rapidly adaptable to various downstream visual tasks [21, 22, 23, 24]. Techniques for
pre-training vision foundation models, such as contrastive learning [25, 26, 1, 27] and self-distillation
[28, 5], focus on aligning features across different models or modalities, while another method,
masked image modeling [6, 29, 30, 4], reconstructs features from masked images to capture high-
level visual semantics. However, these existing vision foundation models are not directly applicable
to cryo-EM imaging. In particular, their application to cryo-EM imaging is limited by the high
noise levels in micrographs, which degrade signal capture. Therefore, we propose a denoising-
reconstruction pre-training framework that is robust to highly noisy cryo-EM micrographs, making it
suitable for specific downstream tasks in cryo-EM.

Vision foundation models in life science. The remarkable success of foundation models has
extended to various life science imaging domains, including applications in retinal [10], fluorescence
microscopy [9], histopathology [7, 8], and radiology imaging [31]. These models have shown
considerable effectiveness in tasks such as disease diagnosis, lesion detection, and image restoration
within these fields. In contrast to these domains, which benefit from extensive and well-curated
datasets supporting model training, the cryo-EM field lacks such resources. To fill this gap, we have
developed a well-curated, large-scale dataset specifically designed to support the training of cryo-EM
foundation models, ensuring that they can be effectively applied in this specialized field.

Cryo-EM image denoising. To tackle the issues of low SNR and complex noise patterns in cryo-EM
images, traditional denoising techniques often employ noise models like the Poisson-Gaussian model
[12, 32] and rely on filtering methods [33, 34, 35] to denoise. However, these methods oversimplify
the noise patterns, which can lead to the loss of high-frequency signal details. Recently, NT2C
[36] uses Generative Adversarial Network to learn the noise patterns for denoising, but it requires
simulated datasets as the clean references. Another series of learning-based methods [37, 38] make
full use of multi-frame data by generating odd and even images for denoising based on Noise2Noise
(N2N) [16, 39] framework. These methods do not require clean images for denoising, but they still
suffer from small-scale datasets and network architectures, which limit their generalizability. In this
paper, we propose DRACO, pre-trained on a large-scale curated dataset, that can naturally serve as a
generalizable denoiser for cryo-EM micrographs.

Downstream tasks in single particle analysis. An effective foundational model can benefit down-
stream tasks in cryo-EM, including micrograph curation and particle picking. Micrograph curation
aims to ensure that only high-quality images are selected for further analysis, yet current methods
rely heavily on manual inspection [40, 41]. Particle picking involves identifying and extracting
representative particles from micrographs, which is a critical task in the cryo-EM single particle
analysis (SPA) reconstruction pipeline. Traditional methods [42, 43, 44], such as template matching
[45, 46] and difference of Gaussians (DoG) method [47], heavily rely on prior information and require
substantial ad hoc post-processing. Learning-based models [48, 49, 50], such as Topaz-Picking [51],
crYOLO [52], and CryoTransformer [53], offer more streamlined processes but still face challenges in
generalizability due to the limited data scale. Our DRACO, pre-trained on large-scale cryo-EM image
datasets, can effectively adapt to these tasks and demonstrate strong generalization capabilities.

Preliminary: Imaging Formation Model

Cryo-EM uses a Direct Detector Device (DDD) camera [32] for their notably higher detective
quantum efficiency (DQE) compared to traditional cameras. This allows recording the micrograph
as a multi-frame movie rather than a single integrated exposure. In this setup, a movie is a series of
continuous multi-frame images, denoted as M = {ˆIi}M
i=1, where each frame ˆIi is an independent
observation of the true signal I.

Ideally, the imaging process in cryo-EM involves two main steps: 1) projecting the 3D density volume
of the region of interest V (x, y, z) : R3 →R along the z-axis via weak-phase object approximation
[54], and 2) modulating the projection image with the Point Spread Function (PSF) g of the cryo-EM

optical lens, expressed as:

I = g ∗
Z
V (x, y, z) dz.
(1)

where I is considered as the true signal.

However, in practice, the captured frames suffer from extremely low SNR due to the limited electron
dosage and the high sensitivity of DDD. The main noise source is Poisson (shot) noise from the
detector, denoted as Poisson(I), arising from the inherent uncertainty of the electron measurement
[12]. We assume that the additional noise types like heat, readout, and dark current noise are
collectively modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian noise G with an unknown variance σ2 [42]:

ˆI = Poisson(I) + G.
(2)

As the number of observations increases, the average of these movie frames converges to the true
signal:

E[ˆI] = I ≈1

M

M
X

i=1
ˆIi.
(3)

We define the image noise ϵ as the difference between the captured and clean images for each frame.
Thus, the expectation (mean value) of noise distribution is:

E[ϵ] = E[ˆIi −I] = 0.
(4)

Thus, we derive that the cryo-EM image noise is zero-mean. This conclusion is also aligned with
existing cryo-EM reconstruction methods [42, 41], which directly assume that the noise distribution
is an additive zero-mean Gaussian yet can still achieve high-resolution reconstruction. We are well
aware that this derivation is relatively trivial compared to an actual theoretical analysis [12], but this
gives us intuitive guidance to integrate the N2N [16] idea: learning to denoise images from solely
noisy image pairs, into our pre-training framework.

Movie to micrograph triplets. Given an M-frame movie M, we divide it into odd frames Mo =
{I2i−1}⌈M/2⌉
i=1
and even frames Me = {I2i}⌊M/2⌋
i=1
. An off-the-shelf motion correction method [13]
is then applied to correct cross-frame drifts in M, Mo, and Me. By summing up the frames within
each subset, we generate three micrographs with the same shape: the original micrograph ˆI, odd
micrograph ˆIo, and even micrograph ˆIe, As aforementioned, all these micrographs are expected to
reflect the true signal I but corrupted by noises.

Denoising-reconstruction Autoencoder

We introduce DRACO, a denoising-reconstruction autoencoder for cryo-EM, as illustrated in Figure
2. Different from existing masked imaging modeling methods, our model uses paired odd-even
micrographs as inputs for the denoising target on visible patches. Further, we utilize the original
micrographs as the additional supervision signal for reconstruction on masked patches.

Masking. Following the standard scheme in Vision Transformer (ViT) [55], each micrograph in a
triplet, consisting of one original, one odd, and one even micrograph from the same movie, is divided
into regular non-overlapping patches. We create patch sets {xo
i}N
i=1 for the odd, {xe
i}N
i=1 for the even,
and {xi}N
i=1 for the original micrograph, where N represents the number of patches. For the odd and
the even micrographs used as inputs in our model, we generate two sets of binary masks, {mo
i}N
i=1
and {me
i}N
i=1, with a mask ratio γ. Here, mi = 1 means the i-th patch is masked, and 0 means
unmasked. Additionally, we ensure that a patch can be 1) only visible in one of them, or 2) masked in
both. This strategy ensures that each visible patch has no information sharing of its corresponding
patch on the other micrograph. Notably, this requires γ ≥0.5 for each input micrograph.

Network architecture. For DRACO’s pre-training, we employ a ViT-based encoder-decoder archi-
tecture following the MAE framework [6]. Positional embeddings are first added to the input patches,
which are then masked to select only visible patches, denoted as {vi}γN
i=1. The encoder, Genc, is a
ViT that transforms these visible patches from either odd or even micrographs into latent features. To

Figure 2: The pipeline of DRACO. Given a pair of partially masked odd and even micrographs, the
encoder takes odd-visible patches and even-visible patches as inputs. The unmasked latent patches
are combined with masked latent patches together to generate the latent representation zi. Then
the latent representation passes through the decoder to generate predicted patches. The N2N loss is
applied to odd-visible predicted patches with corresponding even input patches, and vice versa. The
reconstruction loss is applied to both invisible predicted patches with higher SNR input patches.

(5)

Each of the latent features from odd and even micrographs retain part of the original micrograph’s
information. To reconstruct the micrograph, we generate the latent representation {zi}N
i=1 for further
processing by the decoder:

zi = (1 −mo
i) · zo
i + (1 −me
i) · ze
i + mo
i · me
i · [MASK],
(6)

where the [MASK] token is a shared learnable embedding representing the masked patch to be
predicted. Finally, the decoder Gdec takes the latent representation {zi}N
i=1 with another positional
embedding added as input and predicts all masked and visible patches to reconstruct the complete
micrograph:
{yi}N
i=1 = Gdec({zi}N
i=1; θdec).
(7)

Denoising target. Inspired by N2N and Topaz-Denoise [37], which predict denoised images only
from paired noisy images, we introduce an image-denoising target on visible patches. For any patch
xi visible in only the odd micrographs, the model predicts its counterpart in the even micrographs,
and vice versa, as illustrated in Figure 2. As mentioned earlier, the expectation (mean) values of the
odd and even micrographs are the true signal. Therefore, following Topaz-Denoise, we employ a
patch-wise L2 loss function for each visible patch, aiming for regressing the true signal:

LN2N(xo
i, xe
i, yi) =
∥xe
i −yi∥2
2,
if mo
i = 0,
∥xo
i −yi∥2
2,
if me
i = 0.
(8)

Reconstruction target. For masked patches, we let the decoder predict the pixel value of patches
from the original micrograph with higher SNR compared to odd and even micrographs for better
reconstruction quality. Thus, the reconstruction loss is:

Lrecon(xi, yi) = ∥xi −yi∥2
2,
if mo
i · me
i = 1.
(9)

Training objective. During training, we combine the N2N loss with the reconstruction loss:

L = LN2N + λLrecon,
(10)

where λ is a hyper-parameter set to 1.0 in all our experiments.

Experiments

Large-scale curated dataset for pre-training. The effectiveness and robustness of DRACO depend
heavily on the quality and scale of the cryo-EM pre-training dataset. However, direct access to
public databases like the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR) [17] results in
variations in data quality, inconsistent data formats, and inaccurate or even missing annotations. To
overcome these challenges, we have developed a data generation workflow. First, we select datasets
with reported resolutions better than 10 Å, ensuring high-quality data acquisition. Next, we collect
the raw data, including metadata, movies, and micrographs, from pre-defined high-quality datasets
available on EMPIAR. Finally, we re-process the raw data using cryoSPARC [41] through a custom
processing pipeline designed to exclude low-quality micrographs and movies, generate annotations for
downstream tasks, and verify the resolutions of the reconstructed results. This workflow has allowed
us to compile a large-scale, curated cryo-EM dataset containing over 270,000 raw micrographs
and more than 50,000 raw movies from 529 verified single-particle cryo-EM datasets, occupying
approximately 25 TB of disk storage in total. Details of the cryoSPARC processing pipeline are
provided in Appendix C.1.

Data augmentation. Each micrograph in a triplet goes through the same data augmentation process:
randomly cropping to between 1/16 and 1/4 of the original size (typically 4096 × 4096), resizing to
256 × 256, applying random horizontal and vertical flips, and finally normalizing based on the mean
and standard deviation computed from the original micrograph. We randomly crop each micrograph
16 times within a single epoch for fully utilization.

Pre-training details. We explore the performance of DRACO using two ViT architectures for
the encoder, ViT-B and ViT-L, denoted as DRACO-B and DRACO-L, respectively. The decoder
of DRACO uses 8 Transformer blocks with embedding dimension 512, followed by a three-layer
convolution neck and a linear projection layer with an output dimension 16 × 16, which is also the
patch size of the input. The mask ratio for the one input micrograph is 0.75 by default. To fully utilize
our large-scale curated dataset, we warm up DRACO on the original 270,000 micrographs based
on the MAE training scheme for 200 epochs. Then we adopt our novel denoising-reconstruction
pre-training for 400 epochs. The warm-up stage takes 6 hours, and the pre-training stage takes 16
hours on a GPU cluster with 64 NVIDIA A800 GPUs, requiring approximately 80 GB of memory
for a batch size of 4096.

5.1
Particle Picking

Particle picking aims to accurately locate particles in highly noisy micrographs, which is directly
related to the resolution of the final reconstructed result. For adaption, we conduct supervised fine-
tuning based on the ViT-based object detection framework Detectron2 [21] on our curated dataset.
The results show that DRACO is capable of accurately detecting particles of various shapes and sizes
across three challenging datasets.

Dataset. To create the annotated dataset for adaptation, we employ the standard workflow of
cryoSPARC to generate a high-quality annotated dataset containing over 80,000 full micrographs and
approximately 8 million particles across 46 types of protein. Detailed descriptions of the annotation
workflow can be found in Appendix C.2. The test dataset includes three full micrograph sets with
EMPIAR ID 1) 10081: Human HCN1 channel protein [56], the protein structure has a similar shape
to ice, which could lead to false positive picking, 2) 10350: LetB transport protein [57], this kind of
protein tends to aggregate together, posing challenges in accurate picking in crowded area, and 3)
10407: 70S ribosome [58], the micrographs are in the extremely low SNR.

Baseline and metrics. We compare DRACO with existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods
for generalized particle picking, including Topaz [51], crYOLO [52], and CryoTransformer [53].
For ViT-based baselines, including MAE, DRACO-B and DRACO-L as aforementioned. We
integrate them into Detectron2 framework by loading pre-trained weights of DRACO’s encoder into
Detectron2’s encoder. Additionally, to show the effectiveness of pre-trained encoder, we compare
with Detectron2 trained from scratch. More configuration details can be found in Appendix D.1. We
evaluate baselines in terms of conventional metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score, and the
resolution of the resolved 3D structure from the picked particles, which is also a crucial metric. We
process the particles selected by each method with the standard cryoSPARC workflow and finally

C.3.

Results. As illustrated in Figure 3, both Topaz and CryoTransformer tend to pick a larger number
of particles, but this often results in many false positives. In contrast, crYOLO achieves higher
precision in picking, yet exhibits a higher number of false negatives. Detectron2 trained from
scratch and pre-trained MAE both have difficulties in distiguishing signal and noise, leading to a
lack of generalizability. In contrast, DRACO effectively identifies correct particles, surpassing the
performance of all baselines, as demonstrated in Table 1.

5.2
Micrograph Denoising

Once pre-trained, our model can naturally serve as a generalizable denoiser by directly predicting
every patch of input noisy micrograph without any further fine-tuning.

Baseline and metrics. To evaluate the effectiveness of DRACO on the denoising task, we first
compare DRACO with the standard MAE trained on the 270,000 micrographs from our large-scale
curated dataset with ViT-B as the backbone, denoted as MAE. We further compare with a popular
denoising method Topaz-Denoise [37] in cryo-EM. For a fair comparison, we train Topaz-Denoise
on our odd-even micrograph dataset for 100 epochs with default settings. Last, we compare with
the traditional method Low-pass filtering that has already been integrated into commercial software
cryoSPARC [41]. We utilize the same protocol used in cryoSPARC and set the low-pass cutoff
resolution to 20 Å. As cryo-EM micrographs lack clean ground truth, following Topaz-Denoise, we
employ an SNR calculation method that involves 20 manually annotated signal-background region
pairs as references. For each i-th pair, we calculate the mean and variance for both the signal region

Dataset. To evaluate the denoising capabilities of the baseline models, we select four original
micrograph datasets as test datasets, which are excluded from the training set. These sets are Human
Apoferritin (EMPIAR-10421) [59], HA Trimer (EMPIAR-10096) [60], Phage MS2 (EMPIAR-10075)
[61], and RNA polymerase (EMPIAR-11521) [62]. For each dataset, 5 micrographs are selected and
20 signal-background pair regions are labeled in total. Specifically, these signal and background
regions are chosen close together to ensure similar background signals across both regions.

Results. The quantitative experiments show that DRACO achieves significant performance improve-
ments in terms of SNR after denoising compared with state-of-the-art methods, as shown in Table
2. In Figure 4, the standard MAE can only recover smooth contours of the particle with severe
artifacts. Low-pass filtering smooths both signal and background noise, but the background noise is
still relatively high and the structure information of particles is corrupted. Topaz sometimes fails to
effectively denoise micrographs but over-smooth them instead, which affects the generalizability. In
contrast, DRACO outperforms all baselines in retaining the original particle signals with the lowest
background noises, showing the best generalizability. We additionally reconstruct 3D density map
and corresponding resolution using the denoised particles generated by each method. To ensure

that comparisons reflect only the impact of denoising quality, we fix the locations and poses of the
picked particles, which were determined using the cryoSPARC workflow. The results are shown
in Table 3. DRACO consistently achieves the highest resolution in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness in preserving more high-frequency signals while effectively reducing background noise.
We demonstrate additional denoising results in Figure 5.

Micrograph Curation

A modern cryo-EM can capture thousands of micrographs in a day. However, the quality of captured
micrographs is unverified. Low-quality micrographs may arise from artifacts such as empty sample,
ice crystals, ethane contamination, severe drifting, etc. [40]. Low-quality micrographs can negatively
contribute to the final reconstruction results. A reliable automated micrograph curation method can
significantly improve the efficiency of the data processing pipeline, resulting in shorter processing time
and improved final resolution. We show that DRACO can easily adapt to this 2-class classification
task by linear probing, and achieving the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art method.
Similar to [6], we freeze the encoder backbone and train an extra linear classification head.

Dataset. We manually annotate 1,194 micrographs from original micrograph datasets, assigning a
binary label (accept or reject) to each to indicate quality. The dataset comprises 617 high-quality and
577 low-quality micrographs. We divided these micrographs into training and evaluation datasets
using an 80%/20% split ratio.

Baseline and metric. We compare DRACO-B and DRACO-L with linear probing against several
baselines: a small ResNet18 [63]; an existing supervised method Miffi [40], which has been trained
on 45,000 annotated data; and the standard MAE with linear probing both pre-trained and adapted
on our datasets. The ResNet18 is trained from scratch to show the effectiveness of our pre-training
strategy. More configuration details is provided in Appendix D.2. We report the widely used metrics
for classification including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy on our test dataset. As Miffi
predicts multi-labels on low-quality micrographs, we consider them all as rejections for our metric
calculations.

Results. As shown in Table 4, Miffi, limited by insufficient training data, lacks generalizability on
the test dataset. Both ResNet and MAE face difficulties in effectively separating noise from signal
for classification for accurate classification. In contrast, DRACO extracts global information from
noisy images more effectively, resulting in higher classification accuracy and demonstrating better
generalizability compared to other methods.

can effectively scale up. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different mask ratios on denoising
and micrograph curation performance, as shown in Table 5. DRACO achieves the highest SNR and
curation metric at a 0.75 mask ratio, thus we choose 0.75 as our default mask ratio. We have also
conducted an additional ablation study of loss design. Specifically, we remove either the N2N loss
(w/o N2N) or the reconstruction loss (w/o recon) from the training and evaluate the resulting models
on particle picking and denoising tasks, as shown in Table 6. The result shows that both N2N and
reconstruction losses improve performance. Without the N2N loss, DRACO struggles to distinguish
between signal and noise in micrographs. Without the reconstruction loss, DRACO loses its ability to
extract general features. We show additional visualization of their denoising results (Figure 6) in the
Appendix A.

Discussion

Limitations. As the first attempt to achieve robust feature extraction for cryo-EM via a novel
denoising-reconstruction autoencoder, our work presents opportunities for future enhancements. First,
our method relies heavily on the performance of motion correction algorithms. This can be improved
by designing a more comprehensive denoising task for raw noisy movies. Second, although we
have collected what we believe to be the largest curated dataset for cryo-EM, it focuses primarily on
mainstream single-particle datasets. To enhance dataset diversity, other types of cryo-EM datasets,
such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET)[64] datasets, should also be included. Finally, our
current approach only supports various micrograph-level downstream tasks. For particle-level tasks,
such as pose estimation, a more fine-grained yet robust feature extraction is required. This can be
achieved by developing a particle-level version of DRACO.

Conclusion. We have introduced DRACO, a foundation model designed specifically for cryo-EM
image processing, supported by a unique denoising-reconstruction pre-training framework to enable
robust feature extraction for cryo-EM micrographs. We have constructed a diverse and high-quality
cryo-EM image dataset from the uncurated public database, comprising over 270,000 movies and
micrographs. After pre-training, our model’s versatility is evidenced by its superior adaptation
performance across multiple downstream tasks, including denoising, micrograph curation, and
particle picking. All code, pre-trained model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available
for further research and model development.

Additional Results of DRACO

We demonstrate that DRACO achieves the highest visual denoising quality in terms of both signal
preservation and noise removal, as shown in Figure 5. This figure serves as an extension to Figure
4 in our main paper. Furthermore, we visualize the denoising results from our ablation study on
different mask ratios in Figure 6. We observe that at a 0.75 mask ratio, DRACO achieves the best
denoising results, as supported by Table 2 in our main paper. Lastly, we visualize the reconstruction
ability at a 0.75 mask ratio in Figure 7. DRACO demonstrates comparable reconstruction capability
to MAE, while significantly better denoising results on visible patches.

Zero-shot Capability on Cryo-ET

Though DRACO has not been pre-trained on cryo-ET datasets, we found that DRACO can be
directly applied on cryo-ET tilt series. Here, we demonstrate that DRACO is capable of denoising
the unseen HIV tilt series [65], as shown in Figure 8. Specifically, we evaluate DRACO on both
the tilt series and the volume slices, showing that DRACO effectively removes background noise
and achieves higher contrast in the volume. Furthermore, we assess DRACO’s performance in the
context of reconstruction. We compare the slices from both tomograms reconstructed using original
and denoised tilt series. Additionally, we compare these with the denoised slice from the original
tomogram. The result shows that DRACO can improve the contrast of slices before or after the
reconstruction.

Workflow of CryoSPARC

C.1
Pre-training Dataset Details

EMPIAR [17] is a public archive for storing raw cryo-EM images and 3D reconstructions from vEM
and XT experiments. It currently contains over 2,000 entries, totaling more than 2 PB of data. The
EMDB [66] is an archive of 3D reconstructions derived from cryo-EM experiments, many of which
supplement the experimental information of the EMDB-related EMPIAR entries, such as sample
preparation and reconstruction processes.

In the field of 3D electron microscopy, cryo-EM micrographs undergo complex image processing to
achieve 3D reconstructions with specified resolutions. Experts can model protein molecules accurately
on 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 Å. We define the quality of datasets from the
perspective of structural biology; hence, high-quality datasets should produce high-resolution 3D
reconstructions suitable for detailed analysis.

When constructing the pre-training dataset, we utilize the REST API provided by EMPIAR to
obtain metadata for each dataset, such as experiment type, EMDB ID, and image classification. We
specifically filter for EMPIAR entries that are experimentally linked to EMDB, prioritizing those with
reconstruction resolutions better than 10 Å. Subsequently, we collect as many datasets as possible
that contain single-frame micrographs. For datasets that include multiple frames, we further process
them by separating the frames into odd and even micrographs.

Cryo-EM raw data consists of multi-frame recordings known as movies, which capture the number of
electrons. After motion correction [13], these movies yield single frames referred to as micrographs.
We download as many single-frame micrographs as possible, categorized by image type. Additionally,

17


---Page Break---
we process multi-frame movies into single-frame micrographs using cryoSPARC’s Patch Motion
Correction. For each multi-frame movie, we separately process the complete frames, odd frames, and
even frames to generate three types of single-frame micrographs for DRACO learning.

C.2
Particle Picking Dataset Details.

We filter and generate a dataset comprising approximately 80,000 single-frame micrographs annotated
with about 8 million particles, following a process based on the cryo-EM single particle analysis
reconstruction pipeline software, cryoSPARC [41]. Each EMPIAR public dataset [17] comes with a
solved 3D density map, available on EMDB [66]. Using the “create template” step in cryoSPARC,
we project this map into 50 diverse poses to generate high-quality templates for template picking.
Subsequent rounds of the “2D classification” step are employed to eliminate potential false positives.
Finally, using these particles, we reconstruct results whose resolution did not differ by more than
20% from the reported resolution. This method allowed us to collect a high-quality annotated particle
dataset.

C.3
3D Reconstruction Pipeline

The reconstruction process is also based on cryoSPARC. After picking the particles, the standard
reconstruction workflow consists of 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction and homogeneous
refinement. 2D classification aims to remove any false positives in picked particles. Ab initio
reconstruction can create an initial 3D model from a certain set of particles. Based on this initial model,
homogeneous refinement can achieve a high-resolution result. The final resolution is determined by
the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curve. The specific method involves dividing the particles into
two random halves, each undergoing homogeneous reconstruction. After reconstruction, we perform
a cross-correlation on each Fourier shell in the frequency domain of two reconstructed 3D density
maps. The final resolution is determined using the standard threshold of 0.143 on the FSC curve.

Downstream tasks settings

D.1
Particle Picking Settings

Particle picking baselines.
We use the Topaz [51] general model with its “resnet16u64” backbone
for our baseline, picking particles that score higher than 0.0 as the final results. We use the crYOLO
[52] general model for our baseline from its official website. Similarly, we use CryoTransformer’s
[53] open-source general model on Github, choosing particles with scores ranging from the 25th to
the 100th percentile.

Detectron2 configurations.
For particle picking, we employ the Faster R-CNN framework within
Detectron2, to fit the particle picking task with our curated dataset. The configurations for both
ViT-B and ViT-L include the standard feature pyramid and window attention [67]. We also set the
non-maximum suppression threshold of the region proposal network to 0.6 and adjust the pooling
size of the box pooler in the region of interest network to 14. Given that the particles are mostly
square, the aspect ratio of the anchors is fixed to 1.0. All other settings remain at their default values.
The data augmentation goes the same process as described in the pre-training stage. We fine-tune
Detectron2-based particle picking model on 64 NVIDIA A800 GPUs for 100 epochs with a batch size
of 256, requiring approximately 9 hours and consuming around 100GB of memory. After fine-tuning,
we process the test dataset and pick particles with scores higher than 0.1 as the final results.

D.2
Micrograph Curation Settings

For micrograph curation, each ViT-based model undergoes a linear probing phase, while a ResNet18
[63] is trained from scratch. We employ the miffi_v1 [40] general model of Miffi to inference on test
datasets. All the model trains 50 epochs with a batch size of 128 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090
GPU, taking about 10 minutes and utilizing around 8GB of memory.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .
• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.
• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",
• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.
• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We believe that the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the development
of our model, its training methodology, its effectiveness on various downstream tasks, and
the creation of a curated dataset to support this model.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: We have listed out the limitations of our work in Discussion.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided the image and the noise model use in Section 3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have clearly described the data curation pipeline, data preprocessing,
network architecture, and adaptions to downstream tasks in Experiments and Appendix A.

Guidelines:

20


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We do not provide code and data in submission. However, the code and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

21


---Page Break---
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have stated the pre-training details in Section 5 and the adaptation details
in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We do not provide error bars or other appropriate information about the
statistical significance of the experiments.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have stated the pre-training computer resources in Experiments and the
adaptation computer resources in Appendix B.

22


---Page Break---
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our research are all conducted in line with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the positive and negative societal impacts in Introduction
and Discussion.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

23


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not describle safeguards in our paper, but we will consider to prevent
our model and data from misuse when we release our code and dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All of our code and datasets we built upon are in public with proper licenses.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All of code and datasets we built upon are in public with proper licenses.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

24


---Page Break---
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have crowdsourcing experiments in our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not have crowdsourcing experiments in our paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
