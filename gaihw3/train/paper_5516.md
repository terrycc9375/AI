Abstract

Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuo-
motor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands
of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key
reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly
either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior
cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-
supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert
demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward
dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame
in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground
truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such
as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

Introduction

Learning visuo-motor policies from human demonstrations is an exciting approach for training
difficult control tasks in the real world [1–5]. However, a key challenge in such a learning paradigm
is to efficiently learn a policy with fewer expert demonstrations. To address this, prior works have
focused on learning better visual representations, often by pretraining on large Internet-scale video
datasets [6–11]. However, as shown in Dasari et al. [12], these out-of-domain representations may not
transfer to downstream tasks with very different embodiments and viewpoints from the pretraining
dataset.

An alternative to using Internet-pretrained models is to train the visual representations ‘in-domain’
on the demonstration data collected to solve the task [13, 4]. However, in-domain datasets are much
smaller than Internet-scale data. This has resulted in the use of domain-specific augmentations [13]
to induce representational invariances with self-supervision or to collect larger amounts of demon-
strations [2, 14]. The reliance of existing methods on large datasets might suggest that in-domain
self-supervised pretraining is ineffective for visuo-motor control, and we might be better with simply
training end-to-end. In this work, we argue the contrary – in-domain self-supervision can be effective
with a better training objective that extracts more information from small datasets.

(b) Policy on pretrained representations

Figure 1: (a) We present DynaMo, a new self-supervised method for learning visual representations for
visuomotor control. DynaMo exploits the causal structure in demonstrations by jointly learning the encoder with
inverse and forward dynamics models. DynaMo requires no augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to
ground truth actions. This enables downstream policy learning using limited in-domain data across simulated and
real-world robotics tasks. For each environment, we pretrain the visual representation in-domain with DynaMo
and learn a policy on the pretrained embeddings. (b) We provide real-world rollouts of policies learned with
DynaMo representation on our multi-task xArm Kitchen and Allegro Manipulation environments.

Prevalent approaches for using self-supervision in downstream control often make a bag-of-frames
assumption, using contrastive methods [15, 16] or masked autoencoding [11, 8] on individual frames
for self-supervision. Most of these approaches ignore a rich supervision signal: action-based causality.
Future observations are dependent on past observations, and unobserved latent actions. Can we
obtain a good visual representation for control by simply learning the dynamics? In fact, this idea
is well-established in neuroscience: animals are thought to possess internal models of the motor
apparatus and the environment that facilitate motor control and planning [17–24].

In this work, we present Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control (DynaMo), a new self-
supervised method for pretraining visual representations for visuomotor control from limited in-
domain data. DynaMo jointly learns the encoder with inverse and forward dynamics models, without
access to ground truth actions [25, 26].

To demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaMo, we evaluate our representation on four simulation suites
- Franka Kitchen [27], Block Pushing [28], Push-T [3], and LIBERO [29], as well as eight robotic
manipulation tasks on two real-world environments. Our main findings are summarized below:

1. DynaMo exhibits an overall 39% improvement in downstream policy performance over prior
state-of-the-art pretrained and self-supervised representations, especially on the harder closed-loop
control tasks in Block Pushing and Push-T (Table 1), and on real robot experiments (Table 2).

2. DynaMo is compatible with various policy classes, can be used to fine-tune pretrained weights,
and works in the low-data regime with limited demonstrations on a real-world Allegro hand
(Tables 4, 5, and 2 respectively).

3. Through an ablation analysis, we study the impact of each component in DynaMo on downstream
policy performance (§4.6).

Background

2.1
Visual imitation learning

Our work follows the general framework for visual imitation learning. Given demonstration data
D = {(ot, at)}t, where ot are raw visual observations and at are the corresponding ground-truth
actions, we first employ a visual encoder fθ : ot →st to map the raw visual inputs to lower-
dimensional embeddings st. We then learn a policy π(at|st) to predict the appropriate actions. For
rollouts, we model the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each subsequent
observation ot+1 depends on the previous observation-action pair (ot, at). We assume the action-
conditioned transition distribution p(ot+1|ot, at) to be unimodal for our manipulation tasks.

2.2
Visual pretraining for policy learning

Our goal is to pretrain the visual encoder fθ using a dataset of sequential raw visual observations
D = {ot}t to support downstream policy learning. During pretraining, we do not assume access to
the ground-truth actions {at}t.

Prior work has shown that pretraining encoders on large out-of-domain datasets can improve down-
stream policy performance [6–11]. However, such pretraining may not transfer well to tasks with
different robot embodiments [12].

Alternatively, we can directly pretrain the encoder in-domain using self-supervised methods. One
approach is contrastive learning with data augmentation priors, randomly augmenting an image twice
and pushing their embeddings closer. Another approach is denoising methods, predicting the original
image from a noise-degraded sample (e.g. by masking [11, 8, 30]). A third approach is contrastive
learning with temporal proximity as supervision, pushing temporally close frames to have similar
embeddings [31, 32].

DynaMo

Limitations of prior self-supervised techniques:
Prior self-supervised techniques can learn to
fixate on visually salient features and ignore fine-grained features important for control. We illustrate
this limitation using the Block Pushing environment from Florence et al. [28]. In this task, the goal is
to push a block into a target square. While the robot arm occupies much of the raw pixel space, the
blocks are central to the task despite being smaller in the visual field. Figure 2 visualizes a random
frame from the demonstration data and its 20 nearest neighbors in the embedding space learned by
several self-supervised techniques.

We observe that prior self-supervised methods (details in §4.2) focus on the visually dominant robot,
matching the whole robot arm extremely accurately. However, they fail to capture the block positions,
which are important to the task despite being much less salient visually.

Can we learn a visual encoder that extracts task-specific features better? We know that the demon-
strations are sequential: each observation is dependent on the previous observation, and an action
(unobserved in this setting). Prior self-supervised methods ignore this sequential structure. Con-
trastive augmentations [16, 33] and autoencoding objectives [30, 8, 11] assume that the demonstration
video is a bag of frames, discarding temporal information altogether. Temporal contrast [32, 31]
uses temporal proximity but discards the sequential information in the observations: the contrastive
objectives are usually symmetric in time, disregarding past/future order.

Instead of a contrastive or denoising objective, we propose a dynamics prediction objective that
explicitly exploits the sequential structure of demonstration observations.

Overview of DynaMo:
The key insight of our method is that we can learn a good visual repre-
sentation for control by modeling the dynamics on demonstration observations, without requiring
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to the ground truth actions. Given a sequence of raw

visual observations (o1, . . . , oT ), we jointly train the encoder fθ : ot →st, a latent inverse dynamics
model q(zt:t+h−1|st:t+h), and a forward dynamics model p(ˆst+1:t+h|st:t+h−1, zt:t+h−1). We model
the actions as unobserved latents, and train all models end-to-end with a consistency loss on the
forward dynamics prediction. For our experiments, we use a ResNet18 [34] encoder, and causally
masked transformer encoders [35] for the inverse and forward dynamics models. The architecture is
illustrated in Figure 3.

3.1
Dynamics as a visual self-supervised learning objective

First, we sample an observation sequence ot:t+h of length h and compute its representation st:t+h =
fθ(ot:t+h). For convenience, we will write st:t+h as s:h, and st+1:t+h as s1:h below. At any given
step, the distribution of possible actions can be multimodal [5]. Therefore, the forward dynamics
transition p(s1:h|s:h−1) can also have multiple modes. To address this, we first model the inverse
dynamics q(z:h−1|s:h), where zt is the latent transition between frames. We assume zt to be well-
determined and unimodal given consecutive frames {st, st+1}. We have z ∈Rm, s ∈Rd, m ≪d
such that the latent cannot trivially memorize the next frame embedding. Finally, we concatenate
(st, zt) and predict the one-step forward dynamics p(ˆs1:h|s:h−1, z:h−1).

For environments with multiple views, we compute a loss over each view separately and take the
mean. We choose λ = 0.04 following Bardes et al. [36] for the total loss L. We find that covariance
regularization slightly improves downstream task performance.

Naively, this objective admits a constant embedding solution. To prevent representation collapse,
for Ldyn(ˆs, s∗), we follow SimSiam [37] and set the target embedding s∗
t := sg(st), where sg is the
stop gradient operator. Alternatively, our objective is also compatible with a target from a momentum
encoder f¯θ [33, 16], s∗
t := ¯st = f¯θ(ot), where ¯θ is an exponential moving average of θ.

We train all three models end-to-end with the objective in Eq. 1, and use the encoder for downstream
control tasks.

Experiments

We evaluate our dynamics-pretrained visual representation on a suite of simulated and real bench-
marks. We compare DynaMo representations with pretrained representations for vision and control, as
well as other self-supervised learning methods. Our experiments are designed to answer the following
questions: (a) Does DynaMo improve downstream policy performance? (b) Do representations
trained with DynaMo work on real robotic tasks? (c) Is DynaMo compatible with different policy
classes? (d) Can pretrained weights be fine-tuned in domain with DynaMo? (e) How important is
each component in DynaMo?

4.1
Environments and datasets

We evaluate DynaMo on four simulated benchmarks and two real robot environments (depicted in
Figure 4). We provide a brief description below with more details included in Appendix A.

(a) Franka Kitchen [27]: The Franka Kitchen environment consists of seven simulated kitchen
appliance manipulation tasks with a 9-dimensional action space Franka arm and gripper.
The dataset has 566 demonstration trajectories, each completing three or four tasks. The
observation space is RGB images of size (224, 224) from a fixed viewpoint. We evaluate
for 100 rollouts and report the mean number of completed tasks (maximum 4).

(b) Block Pushing [28]: The simulated Block Pushing environment has two blocks, two target
areas, and a robot pusher with 2-dimensional action space (end-effector translation). Both
the blocks and targets are colored red and green. The task is to push the blocks into either
same- or opposite-colored targets. The dataset has 1 000 demonstration trajectories. The
observation is RGB images of size (224, 224) from two fixed viewpoints. We evaluate for
100 rollouts and report the mean number of blocks in targets (maximum 2).

(c) Push-T [3]: The environment consists of a pusher with 2-dimensional action space, a
T-shaped rigid block, and a target area in green. The task is to push the block to cover
the target area. The dataset has 206 demonstration trajectories. The observation space is a
top-down view of the environment, rendered as RGB images of size (224, 224). We evaluate
for 100 rollouts and report the final coverage of the target area (maximum 1).

(d) LIBERO Goal [29]: The environment consists of 10 manipulation tasks with a 7-
dimensional action space simulated Franka arm and gripper. The dataset has 500 demon-
stration trajectories in total, 50 per task goal. The observation space is RGB images of
size (224, 224) from a fixed external camera, and a wrist-mounted camera. We evaluate a

(e) Allegro Manipulation: A real-world environment with an Allegro Hand attached to a
Franka arm. We evaluate on three tasks: picking up a sponge (6 demonstrations), picking up
a teabag (7 demonstrations), and opening a microwave (6 demonstrations). The observation
space is RGB images of size (224, 224) from a fixed external camera. The action space is
23-dimensional, consisting of the Franka pose (7), and Allegro hand joint positions (16).

(f) xArm Kitchen: A real-world multi-task kitchen environment with an xArm robot arm
and gripper. The environment consists of five manipulation tasks. The dataset includes 65
demonstrations across five tasks. The observation space is RGB images of size (128, 128)
from three fixed external cameras, and an egocentric camera attached to the gripper. The
action space is 7-dimensional with the robot end effector pose and the gripper state.

4.2
Does DynaMo improve downstream policy performance?

We evaluate each representation by training an imitation policy head on the frozen embeddings,
and reporting the downstream task performance on the simulated environments. We use Vector-
Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT) [1] for the policy head. For xArm Kitchen, we use a
goal-conditioned BAKU [38] with a VQ-BeT action head. MAE-style baselines (VC-1, MVP, MAE)
use a ViT-B backbone. All other baselines and DynaMo use a ResNet18 backbone.

For environments with multiple views, we concatenate the embeddings from all views for the
downstream policy. Further training details are in Appendix B. Table 1 provides comparisons of
DynaMo pretrained representations with other self-supervised learning methods, and pretrained
weights for vision and robotic manipulation:

• Random, ImageNet, R3M: ResNet18 with random, ImageNet-1K, and R3M [9] weights.

• VC-1: Pretrained weights from Majumdar et al. [11].

• MVP: Pretrained weights from Xiao et al. [8].

• BYOL-T: BYOL + temporal contrast [32]. Adjacent frames ot, ot+1 are sampled as positive

4.3
Do representations trained with DynaMo work on real robotic tasks?

We evaluate the representations pre-trained with DynaMo on two real-world robot environments: the
Allegro Manipulation environment, and the multi-task xArm Kitchen environment. For the Allegro
environment, we use a k-nearest neighbors policy [40] and initialize with ImageNet-1K features for
all pretraining methods, as the dataset is relatively small with around 1 000 frames per task. In the
xArm Kitchen environment, we use the BAKU [38] architecture for goal-conditioned rollouts across
five tasks. For our real-robot evaluations, we compare DynaMo against the strongest performing
baselines from our simulated experiments (see Table 1). The results are reported in Table 2. We
observe that DynaMo outperforms the best baseline by 43% on the single-task Allegro hand and
by 20% on the multi-task xArm Kitchen environment. Additionally, as shown in Table 3, DynaMo
exceeds the performance of pretrained representations by 50% on the Allegro hand. These results
demonstrate that DynaMo is capable of learning effective robot representations in both single-task
and multi-task settings.

4.4
Is DynaMo compatible with different policy classes?

On the Push-T environment [3], we compare all pretrained representations across four policy classes:
VQ-BeT [1], Diffusion Policy [3], MLP (with action chunking [2]), and k-nearest neighbors with
locally weighted regression [40]. We present the results in Table 4. We find that DynaMo representa-

We fine-tune an ImageNet-1K-pretrained ResNet18
with DynaMo for each simulated environment, and
evaluate with downstream policy performance on
the frozen representation as described in §4.2. The
results are shown in Table 5. We find that Dy-
naMo is compatible with ImageNet initialization,
and can be used to fine-tune out-of-domain pre-
trained weights to further improve in-domain task
performance. We also note that our method works
in the low-data regime with ImageNet initialization on the real Allegro hand in Table 2.

4.6
How important is each component in DynaMo?

In Table 6, we ablate each component in DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy
performance on our simulated benchmarks.

Forward dynamics prediction: We replace the one-step forward prediction target s∗
1:h with the
same-step target s∗
:h−1. To prevent the model from trivially predicting s∗
t given st, we replace the
forward dynamics input (s:h−1, z:h−1) with only z:h−1. The ablated objective is essentially a variant
of autoencoding st. We observe that removing forward dynamics prediction degrades performance
across environments.

Inverse dynamics to a transition latent: As described in §3.1, the forward dynamics loss assumes
that the transition is unimodal and requires an inferred transition latent. We observed that removing
the latent from the forward dynamics input results in a significant performance drop.

Bottleneck on the transition latent dimension: For the transition latent z and the observation
embedding s, we find that having dim z ≪dim s stabilizes training. Here we set dim z := dim s,
and find that our model can still learn a reasonable representation in some environments, but training
can destabilize, leading to a high variance in downstream performance.

Covariance regularization: We find that covariance regularization from Bardes et al. [36] im-
proves performance across environments. Training still converges without it, but the downstream
performance is slightly worse.

Stop gradient on target embeddings: We observe that removing techniques like momentum encoder
[33, 16] and stop gradient [37] leads to representation collapse [41, 16, 36].

Observation context: The dynamics objective requires at least 2 frames of observation context. For
Franka Kitchen, we find that a context of 2 frames works best. For the other environments, a longer
observation context (5 frames) improves downstream policy performance. Details of hyperparameters
used for DynaMo visual pretraining can be found in Appendix B.1.

Variants with access to ground truth actions

In Table 7, we compare with two variants of DynaMo where we assume access to ground truth action
labels during visual encoder training.

Only inverse dynamics to ground truth actions: as proposed in Brandfonbrener et al. [26], we train
the visual encoder by learning an inverse dynamics model to ground truth actions, with covariance
regularization, and without forward dynamics.

Full model + inverse dynamics to ground truth actions: we train the full DynaMo model plus
an MLP head to predict the ground truth actions given the transition latents inferred by the inverse
dynamics model.

We observe that in both cases, having access to ground truth actions during visual pretraining does
not seem to improve downstream policy performance. We hypothesize that this is because the
downstream policy already has access to the same actions for imitation learning.

Self-supervised visual representations:
Self-supervised visual representations have been widely
studied since the inception of deep learning. There are several common approaches to self-supervised
visual representation learning. One approach is to recover the ground truth from noise-degraded
samples using techniques like denoising autoencoders [42, 43] and masked modeling [44, 45, 30].
Another approach is contrastive learning, which leverages data augmentation priors [41, 16, 33, 36,
37] or temporal proximity [31, 46] to produce contrastive sample pairs. A third self-supervised
method is generative modeling [47–49], which learns to sequentially generate the ground truth data.
More recently, self-supervision in the latent space rather than the raw pixel space has proven effective,
as seen in methods that predict representations in latent space [50, 51].

Learning from demonstrations:
Learning from human demonstrations is a well-established idea
in robotics [52–55]. With the advances in deep learning, recent works such as [3, 2, 5, 4, 1, 56] show
that imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a viable approach for training robotic
policies in simulated and real-world settings.

Neural basis for learning dynamics:
It is widely believed that animals possess internal dynamics
models that facilitate motor control. These models learn representations that are predictive of sensory
inputs for decision making and motor control [57–60]. Early works such as [17–20] propose that
there exists an internal model of the motor apparatus in the cerebellum for motor control and planning.
[21, 22] propose that the central nervous system uses forward models that predict motor command
outcomes and model the environment. Learning forward and inverse dynamics models also helps
with generalization to diverse task conditions [23, 24].

Predictive models for decision making:
Predictive model learning for decision making is well-
established in machine learning. Learning generative models that can predict sequential inputs has
achieved success across many domains, such as natural language processing [61], reinforcement
learning [62–64], and representation learning [46, 65]. Incorporating the prediction of future states
as an intrinsic reward has also been shown to improve reinforcement learning performance [66–68].
Moreover, recent work demonstrates that world models trained to predict environment dynamics can
enable planning in complex tasks and environments [69–73].

Learning from video for control:
Videos provide rich spatiotemporal information that can be
leveraged for self-supervised representation learning [74–79]. These methods have been extended
to decision-making through effective downstream policy learning [7–11, 6]. Further, recent work
also enables learning robotic policies directly from in-domain human demonstration videos by
incorporating some additional priors [80–84], as well as learning behavioral priors from actionless
demonstration data [85–87].

Visual representation for control:
Visual representation learning for control has been an active
area of research. Prior work has shown that data augmentation improves the robustness of learned
representations and policy performance in reinforcement learning domains [88, 89]. Additionally,
pretraining visual representations on large out-of-domain datasets before fine-tuning for control tasks
has been shown to outperform training policies from scratch [10, 12, 9, 11, 90, 8, 91]. More recent
work has shown that in-domain self-supervised pretraining improves policy performance [92–95] and
enables non-parametric downstream policies [40].

Discussion and Limitations

In this work, we have presented DynaMo, a self-supervised algorithm for robot representation learning
that leverages the sequential nature of demonstration data. DynaMo incorporates predictive dynamics
modeling to learn visual features that capture the sequential structure of demonstration observations.
During pretraining, DynaMo jointly optimizes the visual encoder with dynamics models to extract
task-specific features. These learned representations can then be used for downstream control tasks,
leading to more efficient policy learning compared to prior approaches. We believe that training
DynaMo on larger unlabeled datasets could potentially improve generalization. Additionally, while
promising for control tasks, more research is needed to evaluate DynaMo’s effectiveness on robotic
manipulation outside of lab settings.

A
Environment and dataset details

A.1
Franka Kitchen

The Franka Kitchen environment introdued by Gupta et al. [27] consists of a Franka arm with a
9-dimensional action space. This environment includes seven tasks and a dataset of 566 human-
collected demonstrations. While the original environment is state-based, we created an image-based
variant by rendering the states to 224 × 224 RGB images.

A.2
Block Pushing

In the Block Pushing environment introduced by Florence et al. [28], the objective is for the robot to
push two colored blocks (red and green) into two target squares (also red and green). The training
dataset consists of 1 000 trajectories, evenly distributed among the four possible combinations of
block target and push order. These trajectories were collected by a scripted expert controller.

A.3
Push-T

In the Push-T environment introduced by Chi et al. [3], the goal is to push a T-shaped block to a
designated target position on a table. The dataset for this environment contains 206 demonstrations
collected by human operators. The action space in this environment is a two-dimensional end-effector
position control. Similar to the Franka Kitchen environment, we have created an image-based variant
by rendering demonstrations to 224 × 224 RGB images.

A.4
LIBERO Goal

In the LIBERO Goal environment introduced by Liu et al. [29], there are 10 manipulation tasks, each
with 50 teleoperated demonstrations for goal-conditioned policy benchmarking. The environment has
a 7-dimensional action space and an observation space of 224 × 224 RGB images from two cameras
(fixed external view, and wrist-mounted egocentric view).

A.5
Allegro Manipulation

The environment consists of an Allegro hand attached to a Franka arm, and a fixed camera for image
observations. The observation space is 224 × 224 RGB images. The action space is 23-dimensional,
consisting of Cartesian position and orientation of the Franka robot arm (7 DoF), and 16 joint
positions of the Allegro Robot Hand. The demonstrations are collected at 50Hz for Franka, and 60Hz
for the Allegro hand. The learned policies are rolled out at 4Hz.

We evaluate on three contact-rich dexterous manipulation tasks that require precise multi-finger
control and arm movement, described in detail below.

Sponge picking: This task requires the hand to reach to the position of the sponge, grasp the sponge,
and lift the sponge from the table. We collect 6 demonstrations via OpenTeach [96] for the task,
starting from different positions, with 543 frames in total. The task is considered successful if the
robot hand can grasp the sponge from the table within 120 seconds.

Teabag picking: This task is similar to the previous task, but more difficult with a smaller task object.
We collect 7 demonstrations via OpenTeach with 1 034 frames in total. In this task, the robot needs
reach the teabag, grasp the teabag with two fingers, then pick it up. The task is considered successful
if the robot hand can grasp the teabag from the table within 240 seconds.

Microwave opening: This task requires the hand to reach the microwave door handle, grasp the
handle, and pull down the door. We collect 6 demonstrations via OpenTeach with 735 frames in total.
The task is considered successful if the robot hand can open the door within 240 seconds.

A.6
xArm Kitchen

This is a real-world multi-task kitchen environment comprising a Ufactory xArm 7 robot with an
xArm Gripper. The policies are trained on RGB images of size 128×128 obtained from four different
camera views, including an egocentric camera attached to the robot gripper. The action space

17


---Page Break---
comprises the robot end effector pose and the gripper state. We collect a total of 65 demonstrations
across 5 tasks, depicted in Figure 5. The demonstrations were collected using OpenTeach [96] at
30Hz. The learned policies are deployed at 10Hz. Figure 5 shows real-world task rollouts for the
multitask policy learned for all 5 tasks.

Broader Impacts

In this work, we present DynaMo, a new self-supervised learning method for pretraining in-domain
visual representations for downstream policy learning. Our work takes an important step towards
improves data efficiency by explicitly modeling the dynamics of the demonstration observations,
improving upon prior state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, especially in the low-data regime,
which can be valuable for robotics and visuomotor policy learning research with limited in-domain
data.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We state the claims in the abstract and Section 1, and support them with
experimental results in Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitations in Section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]

24


---Page Break---
Justification: the paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we will release code and data on the website for reproduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

25


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we will release code and data on the website for reproduction.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: details can be found in Section 4, and Appendix A, B.2, and B.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: visual pretraining is compute-intensive, and we have limited compute.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

26


---Page Break---
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: details can be found in Appendix B.2, and B.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we discuss broader impacts in Appendix D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to

27


---Page Break---
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: this work poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: we credit all authors in our paper and respect license and terms of use in our
codebase.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

28


---Page Break---
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: we will be releasing them on the website. All assets have been anonymized.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: this paper does not involve human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: this paper does not involve human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

guidelines for their institution.
