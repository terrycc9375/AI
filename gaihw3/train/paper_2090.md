Abstract

The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on
the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and
high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts.
The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of
rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training
efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this
work, we propose DOGS, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first
decomposes a scene into K blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During
training, our DOGS maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and K
local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped
after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The
training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence
and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians.
Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on
large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

Introduction

Neural 3D scene reconstruction has taken a giant step beyond the limitations of traditional photogram-
metry tools. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [36, 17, 47], which encode scenes implicitly in MLP
or explicitly in voxels, exhibit superior resilience to non-Lambertian effects, appearance changes,
dynamic scenes, etc. However, most NeRF-based methods are inefficient in rendering scenes due to
the need to query massive points for volume rendering to infer scene geometry and color. Recently, 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [21] has shown promising results on real-time applications and inspires
many follow-up works. 3DGS encodes scenes into a set of 3D anisotropic Gaussians, where each
3D Gaussian is represented by a covariance matrix, a center position, opacity, and the latent features
to encode color information. Pixel colors by projecting 3D Gaussians into 2D image space can be
efficiently computed via rasterization, which is highly optimized on modern graphics processors.
However, 3DGS often requires larger memory during training compared to NeRF methods. This is
because 3DGS needs millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a scene to recover high-fidelity scene
details. Consequently, the memory footprint increases drastically for training 3DGS on larger scenes,
e.g. city-scale scenes. Moreover, the training of a huge number of 3D Gaussians on larger scenes leads
to longer training time. Unfortunately, in comparison to NeRF where the rays can be conveniently
distributed into different compute nodes, dispatching 3D Gaussians into different compute nodes is
much more difficult due to the highly customized rasterization procedure of 3DGS. In summary, the
two challenges for reconstructing large-scale scenes with 3DGS are: 1) High GPU memory to hold
the large 3D model during training; 2) Long training time due to the large areas of scenes.

Previous large-scale NeRF methods [49, 51, 35] solve the above-mentioned two issues by embracing a
divide-and-conquer approach, where scenes are split into individual blocks with smaller models fitted
into each block. However, these methods require querying multiple sub-models during inference,
which slows down the rendering efficiency. This leads us to the following question:

“Can we apply a similar methodology to 3DGS during training while querying only a global consistent
model during inference?”

In this work, we propose DOGS to answer the aforementioned question. Following previous large-
scale NeRF methods, our DOGS splits scene structures into blocks for distributed training. Inspired
by previously distributed bundle adjustment methods [15, 62], we apply the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [5] to ensure the consistency of the shared 3D Gaussians between
different blocks. Specifically, we first estimate a tight bounding box for each scene. Subsequently,
we split training views and point clouds into blocks. To guarantee each block has a similar size, we
split scenes into two blocks each time along the longer axis of the bounding box. Scenes are split
recursively in the same way until we obtain the desired number of blocks. Finally, we re-estimate a
bounding box for each block and expand the bounding box to construct shared 3D Gaussians between
blocks. During training, we maintain a global 3D Gaussian model on the master node and dispatch
local 3D Gaussians into other slave nodes. We further guarantee the consistency of the shared 3D
Gaussians and the convergence of the training through 3D Gaussian consensus. Specifically, the
local 3D Gaussians are collected onto the master node and averaged to update the current global
3D Gaussian model at the end of each training iteration, and then the updated global 3D Gaussian
model is shared to all slave nodes to regularize the training of local 3D Gaussians. In this way, our
method guarantees that the local 3D Gaussians converge to the global 3D Gaussian model during
training. By training 3DGS in a distributed way, our DOGS can reduce the training time by 6+
times compared to the original 3DGS. Furthermore, our DOGS guarantees training convergence and
therefore achieves better rendering quality than its counterparts with the 3D Gaussians consensus in
the distributed training. After training, we can drop all local 3D Gaussians and maintain only the
global 3D Gaussians. During inference, we only need to query the global model while maintaining
the rendering performance of 3DGS.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We propose a recursive approach to split scenes into blocks with balanced sizes.

• We introduce a distributed approach to train 3D Gaussians for large-scale scenes. The
training time is reduced by 6+ times compared to the original 3DGS.

• We conduct exhaustive experiments on standard large-scale datasets to validate the effective-
ness of our method.

Related Work

Neural Radiance Fields.
Neural radiance fields [36] enable rendering from novel viewpoints
with encoded frequency features [50]. To improve training and rendering efficiency, follow-up
works [27, 59, 17] either encodes scenes into sparse voxels, or a multi-resolution hash table [37] where
the hash collision is implicitly handled during optimization. TensoRF [6] uses CP-decomposition or
VM-decomposition to encode scenes into three orthogonal axes and planes. While the previously
mentioned work focuses on per-scene reconstruction, other methods also focus on the generalizability
of NeRF [54, 7, 19, 46, 28], bundle-adjusting camera poses and NeRF [25, 34, 8], and leveraging
sparse or dense depth to supervise the training of NeRF [56, 14, 42], etc. To address the aliasing
issue in vanilla NeRF, Mip-NeRF [1] proposed to use Gaussian to approximate the cone sampling,
the integrated positional encodings are therefore scale-aware and can be used to address the aliasing
issue of NeRF. Mip-NeRF360 [2] further uses space contraction to model unbounded scenes. Zip-
NeRF [3] adopted a hexagonal sampling strategy to handle the aliasing issue for Instant-NGP [37].
NeRF2NeRF [18] and DReg-NeRF [9] assumes images are only available during training in each
block, and they propose methods to register NeRF blocks together.

Gaussian Splatting.
Gaussian Splatting [21] initializes 3D Gaussians from a sparse point cloud.
The 3D Gaussians are used as explicit scene representation and dynamically merged and split
during training. Real-time novel view synthesis is enabled by the fast splatting operation through
rasterization. Scaffold-GS [31] initializes a sparse voxel grid from the initial point cloud and encodes
the features of 3D Gaussians into corresponding feature vectors. The introduction of the sparse
voxel reduced the Gaussian densities by avoiding unnecessary densification on the scene surface.
Octree-GS [41] introduces the level-of-details to dynamically select the appropriate level from the set
of multi-resolution anchor points, which ensures consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD
adjustment and maintains high-fidelity rendering results. To reduce the model size, methods [16, 38]
also remove redundant 3D Gaussians through exhaustive quantization. Other methods also focus on
alleviating the aliasing issue of 3D Gaussians [60, 58], or leveraging the efficient rasterizer of point
rendering for real-time indoor reconstruction [20, 33].

Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction.
The classical photogrammetry methods utilized Structure-from-
Motion (SfM) [43] and keypoint extraction with SIFT [30] to reconstruct sparse scene structures.
One of such foundational software is Phototourism [45]. To handle city-scale scenes, the ‘divide-
and-conquer’ strategy is widely adopted for the extensibility and scalability of the 3D reconstruction
system. SfM methods [4, 63, 10, 12, 11] splitting scenes based on the view graph, where images
with strong connections are divided into the same block. By estimating similarity transformations
and merging tracks, all local SfM points and camera poses are fused into a global reference system.
Existing NeRF methods also follow a similar strategy for reconstructing city-scale scenes. When
camera poses are known, the scene can be split into grid cells. Block-NeRF [49] focus on the
day-night or even cross-season street views. It utilizes the appearance encoding in NeRF-W [32]
to fix the appearance inconsistency issue between different blocks, while Mega-NeRF [51] aims
at encouraging the sparsity of the network under aerial scenes. Urban-NeRF [40] leverages lidar
points to supervise the depth of NeRF in outdoor scenes. SUDS [52] further extended Mega-NeRF
into dynamic scenes. Different from previous large-scale NeRF methods, Switch-NeRF [35] uses
a switch transformer that learns to assign rays to different blocks during training. Grid-NeRF [57]
designed a two-branch network architecture, where the NeRF branch can encourage the feature
plane [6] branch recover more scene details under large-scale scenes. However, the two-branch
training scheme is trivial and needs a long time to train. Concurrent works to our method are
VastGaussian [26] and Hierarchy-GS [22], which also utilize 3D Gaussians for large-scale scene
reconstruction. VastGaussian and Hierarchy-GS split scenes into independent chunks and train
independent chunks simultaneously. However, VastGaussian relies on exhaustive searching of the
training views and initial points to guarantee the convergence of training, and each block is trained
without data sharing. Hierarchy-GS consolidates independent chunks into intermediate nodes for
further rendering. However, the hierarchical approach needs to preserve redundant models and it is
specially designed for street view scenes. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on the distributed
training of 3DGS and built upon the consensus of shared 3D Gaussians between different blocks has
a guaranteed convergence rate that achieves better performance.

Preliminary

Gaussian Splatting.
3D Gaussian Splatting represents a scene with a set of anisotropic 3D Gaus-
sians G = {Gi | i ∈N}. Each 3D Gaussian primitive Gi has a center u ∈R3 and a covariance
Σ ∈R3×3 and can be described by:

Gi(p) = exp{−1

2(p −ui)⊤Σ−1
i (p −ui)}.
(1)

During training, the covariance is decomposed into a rotation matrix R ∈R3×3 and a diagonal scaling
matrix S ∈R3×3, i.e. Σi = RSS⊤R⊤to ensure the covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. To
render the color for a pixel p, the 3D Gaussians are projected into the image space for alpha blending:

C =
X

i
ciαi

i−1
Y

j=1
(1 −αj),
(2)

where αi is the rendering opacity and is computed by α = o · Xproj(p).

When training 3D Gaussian Splatting, we minimize the loss function below:
L(x) = Lrgb + λLssim,
(3)
where xi = {ui, qi, si, fi, oi}, q are quaternions corresponds to the rotation matrix R, s are vectors
corresponds to the three diagonal elements of S, and f are coefficients of the spherical harmonics.

Distributed 3D Gaussian Consensus

The ‘divide-and-conquer’ method is a common paradigm for large-scale 3D reconstruction, which
we also adopt in our framework. Different from previous methods such as Block-NeRF [49] and
VastGaussian [26] which are pipeline parallelized, our method is optimization parallelized with
guaranteed convergence. The pipeline of our algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, we split a scene
(training views and point clouds) into K intersected blocks. Secondly, we assign training views and
points into different blocks. By introducing the ADMM into the training process, we also maintain a
globally consistent 3DGS model on a master node. Thirdly, during training, we collect and average
the local 3D Gaussians to update the global 3DGS model in each consensus step. The global 3D
Gaussians are also shared with each block before we distributedly train the local 3D Gaussians in
each block. Finally, we drop all local 3D Gaussians while only using the global 3D Gaussians to
render novel views.

global 3D Gaussians are shared with each block before training all blocks. 4) Finally, we use the final
global 3D Gaussians to synthesize novel views.

In this section, we first introduce the ADMM algorithm. Subsequently, we derive the distributed
3DGS training algorithm. We also present a scene splitting algorithm, which recursively and evenly
splits the scene into two blocks each time.

ADMM.
A general form for consensus ADMM is given by:

minimize

N
X

i=1
fi(xi),
s.t. xi −z = 0, i ∈[1, N].
(4)

By definition, the constraints are applied such that all the local variables xi agree with the global
variable z. By applying the augmented Lagrangian method, we have:

Lρ(x, z, y) =

N
X

i=1

 
fi(xi) + y⊤
i (xi −z) + ρ

(5)

where yi is the dual variable, ρ is the penalty parameter. During optimization, ADMM alternatively
updates the local variables xi, global variable z and the dual variables yi at the t + 1 iteration by:

xt+1
i
:= arg min
 
fi(xi) + yt

Distributed Training.
We apply the ADMM method to distributedly train a large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting model. In our problem, fi(·) in Eq. (4) corresponds to the loss function L(·) in Eq. (3). To
simplify the implementation for Eq. (6a), we adopt a scaled form of ADMM by defining ui = 1

ρyi.
We can then rewrite Eq. (5) into (see supplementary for the derivation):

Lρ(x, z, u) =

N
X

i=1

 
fi(xi) + ρ

2∥xi −z + ui∥2

.
(7)

Compared to Eq. (5), Eq. (7) can be made easier to implement by expressing all terms in the squared
difference errors. Suppose the variables are decomposed into K blocks, we then denote the ith 3D
Gaussians in the kth block as xk
i . Accordingly, we revise the ADMM updating rule by:

(xk
i )t+1 := arg min
 
f(xk
i ) + ρ

2∥(xk
i )t −zt + (uk

(8b)

(uk
i )t+1 := (uk
i )t + (xk
i )t+1 −zt+1.
(8c)

Eq. (8a) is the original loss function in Gaussian Splatting with an additional regularizer term
ρ
2∥(xk
i )t −zt + (uk
i )t∥2
2. Note that Eq. (8b) should be zt+1 :=

K
P

k=1
 
(xk
i )t+1 + (uk
i )t
.
However, the dual variables have an average value of zero after the first iteration. Consequently,
Eq. (8b) can be simplified as the global 3D Gaussians are formed by the average of the local 3D
Gaussians from all blocks. Moreover, Eq. (8b) is called a ‘consensus’ step and it requires collecting
the local 3D Gaussians from all blocks. After updating the global model z, we update the dual
variables ui in Eq. (8c) and share the global 3D Gaussians z to each block for optimizing the local
3D Gaussians in Eq. (8a). Note that each 3D Gaussian xi has different properties {ui, qi, si, fi, oi}.
As a result, the penalty terms and dual variables should be represented separately according to these
properties. The detailed form of Eq. (8) is given in the supplementary.

Scene Splitting.
We decompose the scene into K blocks before applying the updating rule in
Eq. (8). Unlike VastGaussian [26], which focuses mostly on splitting large-scale scenes and needs
exhaustive search on the training views and point clouds to ensure the consistency of 3D Gaussians
in different blocks, our method relies on the consensus step to ensure the consistency of the 3DGS.
However, scene splitting is still important to the convergence of our method. We propose two
constraints for the scene-splitting method to best balance the training efficiency and rendering quality:

1. Individual blocks should have a similar size.

5


---Page Break---
2. Adjacent blocks should have enough overlaps to boost the convergence of training.

The first constraint is proposed to ensure that: 1) Each block can be fed into GPUs with the same
capacity. This is important since a larger block can cause an out-of-memory of the GPU during
training due to the imbalanced splitting results. 2) Each block has a similar training time at each
iteration. After every t iteration, we collect all local 3D Gaussians from each block. Intuitively, larger
blocks require a longer time to train. Consequently, the master node and all other slave nodes have to
wait for the nodes with larger blocks to finish, which increases the training time unnecessarily.

The second constraint is used to boost the convergence of ADMM. From Eq. (8b), the local 3D
Gaussians would converge to the global 3D Gaussians by averaging the shared local 3D Gaussians
during training. Sufficient shared 3D Gaussians encourage reconstruction consistency between
different blocks. Too many shared local 3D Gaussians can bring more communication overhead,
which inevitably slows down the training while a lack of shared 3D Gaussians leads to divergence of
the algorithm. Although there is no theoretical analysis to show the optimal value of overlapping
parts, we empirically use a constant value which we will introduce later in our experiments.

in imbalanced blocks. (b) Our recursive bipartite strategy solves the imbalanced splitting issue. (c)
Points and views with the same grid coordinate are assigned to the same block.

We assume one of the axes of the scene is aligned to physical ground, which can usually be done
under the Manhattan world assumption. VastGaussian [26] adopts a grid-splitting method that first
splits the scene into m cells along the x-axis, and then splits each of the m cells into n sub-cells along
the y-axis. As we show in Fig. 3a, this strategy can result in imbalanced blocks. Our splitting method
is inherited from VastGaussian while adopting a recursive spitting method to resolve the imbalanced
issue. Specifically, we first estimate a tight bounding box for the initial scene. We then split the scene
into two parts along the longer axis of the scene. Splitting the scene along the longer axis can prevent
the blocks from becoming too shallow on one axis. We re-estimate a tighter bounding box for each
of the two cells and split them into smaller blocks. This step is repeated until the number of blocks
reaches our requirement. We present the result of this recursive method in Fig. 3b. Compared to
Fig. 3a, we produce more balanced blocks. To construct overlapping areas, we expand the bounding
box of each block by a scale factor s, any points/views that are covered by the same bounding box
are grouped into the same block. The training views and point clouds are split in the same way as is
shown in Fig. 3c.

3.3
Improving Convergence Rate

ADMM is known to be sensitive to the initialization of penalty parameters. Since improper initial
penalty parameters can slow down the training, we introduce the adaptive penalty parameters and
over-relaxation to improve the convergence rate.

Primal Residual and Dual Residual.
We define the primal residual rt and the dual residual st as

rt = xt
i −zt,
st = ρ(zt −zt−1).
(9)

6


---Page Break---
In ADMM, the primal residual and dual residual are used as the stopping criteria which terminate the
optimization. In our method, we use a hard threshold of training iteration to terminate the algorithm.
The primal residual and dual residual are used to adaptively adjust the penalty parameters.

Adaptive Penalty Parameters.
We adopt a similar scheme from [5] to adaptively adjust the penalty
parameters:

ρt+1 =












τ incρt,
∥rt∥2 > µ∥st∥2,

ρt

τ dec ,
∥st∥2 > µ∥rk∥2,

ρt,
∥st∥2 = µ∥rk∥2,

(10)

where µ > 1, τ inc, τ dec are hyper-parameters. The existing convergence proof of the ADMM
algorithm is based on the fixed penalty parameters [5]. To guarantee the convergence of our algorithm,
we stop adjusting the penalty parameters after 2000 iterations in all of our experiments.

Over Relaxation.
Similar to [5], we replace xt+1 with αtxt+1 −(1 −αt)(−zt) in Eq. (8b) and
Eq. (8c), where αt ∈(0, 2) is the relaxation parameter and experiments show that the over-relaxation
with αt ∈[1.5, 1.8] can improve convergence.

Experiments

Datasets.
We evaluate our method on the two large-scale urban datasets, the Mill19 [51]1 dataset,
the UrbanScene3D [29]2 dataset, and the MatrixCity [24] dataset. Both datasets are captured by
drones and each scene contains thousands of high-resolution images. During training and evaluation,
we adopt the original image splitting in Mega-NeRF [51], and downsample the images by 6+ times
from the original resolution.
Implementation Details.
For Mill19 and UrbanScene3D, we use the camera poses provided by
the official site of Mega-NeRF [51]. The y-axis of the scene is aligned to the horizontal plane by
COLMAP [43] under the Manhattan world assumption. We use the CPU version of SIFT (SIFT-
CPU) in COLMAP [43] to extract keypoints and match each image to its nearest 100 images using
vocabulary trees. With known camera poses and keypoint matches, we further triangulate 3D points
and bundle adjust them. The SIFT-CPU can extract more points than the SIFT-GPU, which can benefit
the initialization of 3D Gaussians. For the original 3D Gaussian Splatting (denoted as ‘3DGS’),
we train it in 500,000 iterations and densify it for every 200 iterations until it reaches 30,000 steps.
We train both VastGaussian and our method in 80,000 iterations. The densification intervals and
termination steps are the same as the 3DGS. We reimplement VastGaussian [26] since its code was
not released during this work. Note that we did not implement the decoupled appearance embedding
in VastGaussian, which can be used to remove floaters caused by inconsistent image appearance. We
argue that we still provided a fair comparison since this module can be applied to all 3DGS-based
methods. For our method, consensus and sharing are enabled every 100 iterations. We leverage the
remote procedure call (RPC) framework of PyTorch [39] to implement our distributed algorithm and
transmit data across different compute nodes.
Results.
We employ PSNR, SSIM [55] and LPIPS [61] as metrics for novel view synthesis. We
compare our method against the state-of-the-art large-scale NeRF-based methods: Mega-NeRF [51],
Switch-NeRF [35]3, and 3DGS-based methods: 3DGS [21]4, Fed3DGS [48], VastGaussian [26],
Hierarchy-GS [22]. For Mega-NeRF and Switch-NeRF, we use the officially provided checkpoints
on 8 blocks for evaluation. The results of Hierarchy-GS are cited from the original paper since its
code has not been released during this work.

We present the quantitative visual quality results in Table 1. The training time and rendering efficiency
are also provided in Table 2. As shown in the tables, methods based on 3D Gaussians achieved better
results than NeRF-based methods. Although NeRF-based methods are comparable to 3DGS methods
in PSNR, the rendered images lack details in such large-scale scenes. This is also validated from

---Page Break---
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Moreover, NeRF-based methods are much slower than 3DGS-based methods and
take longer time to train – even if they are trained distributedly. Notably, our method achieves the best
results in almost all the scenes. The original 3DGS has results comparable to ours. However, it takes
6 ∼8× more training time than our method. We also emphasize that we build a strong baseline of
3DGS for fair comparison: the densification interval is 200 iterations, which is 8 times more frequent
than the 3DGS baseline in VastGaussian; the training iteration is 500K (in comparison, the training
iteration of the 3DGS baseline is 450K in VastGaussian). VastGaussian trains 3DGS faster than
our method. This is because our method requires additional time for data transmission. However,
our method achieves better rendering quality than VastGaussian. Moreover, the data transmission
time does not become the bottleneck of our method due to our balanced scene splitting method.
Particularly, each block has a similar training time and the master node does not need to wait for a
long time for the fat nodes to finish its job.

To further show the applicability of our method to larger-scale scenes, we evaluated our method on
the 2.7km2 Small City scene in the MatrixCity [24] dataset, which contains 5, 620 training views and
741 validation views. We early terminated the training of the original 3DGS since it did not finish

Gaussian primitives due to the imbalanced splitting. From Table 3, our method achieved the best
results in rendering quality. The visual qualitative results are shown in Fig. 6.

the over-relaxation is denoted as w.o. OR. As shown in the table, the performance drastically drops
without the ADMM consensus step. Furthermore, the results without applying the self-adaptation of
penalty parameters is about 1.5 dB lower than the full model in PSNR. The model without applying
over-relaxation is comparable to the full model in SSIM and LPIPS but has lower PSNR. We thus
employ over-relaxation in our method. We also present the qualitative differences in Fig. 7, and it
clearly shows the full model has better quality in the rendered images and geometries. We include
more qualitative results in Fig. 8 to show the importance of the consensus step. We can observe that
the distributed training presents noisy results without the consensus step. From the two bottom-right
figures, we can observe obvious artifacts along the block boundary without the consensus step.

Moreover, we ablate the scale factor in constructing the overlapping areas in Table 5. We can find
that the performance of our method is improved with a larger scale factor. Our method has similar
performance when the scale factor is 1.4 and 1.5. However, we select 1.4 in our experiments since a
larger scale factor brings a longer time and more memory requirement.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed DOGS, a scalable method for training 3DGS distributedly under large-scale
scenes. Our method first splits scenes into multiple intersected blocks recursively and then trains
each block distributedly on different workers. Our method additionally maintains a global 3DGS
model on the master node. The global 3DGS model is shared with each block to encourage each
block to converge to the global model. The local 3DGS of all blocks is collected to update the global
3DGS model. When evaluated on large-scale datasets, our method accelerates the 3DGS training
time by 6× ∼8× while achieving the best rendering quality in novel view synthesis.

We denote the average of a vector with an overline. Then the consensus step for Eq. (8b) can be
rewritten by:

zt+1 = ¯xt+1 + ¯ut.
(13)

Moreover, averaging both sides of Eq. (8c) for the dual variables gives:

¯ut+1 = ¯ut + ¯xt+1 −zt+1.
(14)

Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (14) gives that ¯ut+1 = 0, which shows that the dual variables have
average value zeros after the first iteration. Therefore, we proved zt+1 := 1

We provide the detailed form of Eq. (8) in this section. Note that each 3D Gaussian can be represented
by Xi = {ui, qi, si, fi, oi}, we need to apply different penalty terms to different properties of 3D
GS. Specifically, the dual variables correspond to different properties of 3D GS are denoted as:

ui = {up, uq, us, uf, uo},
(15)

where up, uq, us, uf, uo are respectively denote the dual variable corresponds to the mean p, the
quaternion uq, the scaling matrix us, the feature vectors to encode color information uf, and the

we initialize the dual variables up, uq, us, uf, uo to zeros. For the penalty parameters, we set
ρp, ρq, ρs, ρo to 1e4 and ρf to 1e3 empirically. Though there are other choices of the initial values

that could improve the results of our method, we found this set of values is good enough for all scenes
in our experiments and we did not do more ablations on the initial values. Due to computational
resources limitation, we test our method on only 5 GPU nodes, where one is the master node that
maintains the global model and the others are slave nodes for training local 3D Gaussians. The
performance of our method can be improved further with more GPU nodes.

A.7
More Qualitative Results

We present more qualitative results of our method in Fig. 9 and Fif. 10. We provide qualitative
comparisons with VastGaussian in areas where blocks overlap in Fig. 10. Both methods produce fairly
consistent results. However, our method presents higher fidelity rendering results than VastGaussian
near the splitting boundary, which also validated the effectiveness and importance of the consensus
step.

A.8
Limitations and Future Work

Our method can distributedly train 3D GS on large-scale scenes. However, it brings additional
communication overheads to the system. Fortunately, we found the communication overhead did
not slow down the training performance. This is due to our balanced splitting algorithm minimizing
the synchronization time when there is a need to consensus the local 3D Gaussians from all blocks.
Moreover, we pruned unnecessary small 3D Gaussians to further reduce the number of 3D GS, which
also reduced the communication overhead.

Though our method can train large-scale scenes efficiently, the GPU memory requirement can still
be an issue. This is because when we zoom out to capture larger areas, more 3D Gaussians are
included in the rasterization step, which consumes more GPU memory. Our future work will consider
introducing the level-of-details (LOD) technique into our distributed training pipeline. Similar to
existing LOD GS methods [41, 44], LOD can be utilized to reduce the number of 3D Gaussians that
are far away from the cameras.

A.9
More Discussions

Training and Waiting Time of Each Block.
We tested the time cost from transferring the data to
the master node to receiving data from the master node for each slave node on the Campus dataset.
The mean and variance of time are respectively 5.63 seconds and 0.75 seconds each time. The low
variance indicates that our method can balance the training time well. We argue that the data transfer
time of our method can be kept constant since we can always control the number of local Gaussians
to a constant number (e.g. <= 6000, 000 3D Gaussian primitives) with enough GPUs, no matter
how large the scene is, since the data transfer between different slave nodes and the master node is
executed distributedly instead of sequentially.

Implementation Flexibility.
One another issue with our method is that the implementation of
our method is not as flexible as VastGaussian. Our method relies on an RPC module for the data
transmission and communication between the master node and the slave nodes. On the other hand,
VastGaussian can be implemented decentralized without the master node. However, our method can
render higher-quality images and the communication overheads can be neglected compared to the
long training time of the original 3D GS. Therefore, this is not a limitation of our work.

Shift to Other 3D GS Representations.
Many follow-up works improved the original 3D GS.
Some works focus on compressing the size of 3D GS [16, 38] and some of the other works focus on
constraining the training without changing the optimization parameters [64, 23, 13]. These methods
can also be applied to the training of each block in our method. Some other works also adopted
intermediate representations to improve the original 3D GS, i.e., OctreeGS [41] decoded the properties
of 3D GS from the feature embedding in each anchor node, and SAGS [53] adopts hash encodings
for each 3D Gaussian, a GNN encoder, and a corresponding decoder to generate the properties of 3D
Gaussians. In this case, we can change the optimization parameters and the corresponding penalty
parameters and dual variables to these intermediate feature embeddings/encodings. In our future
work, we will consider a more consolidated implementation that can easily shift to these 3D GS
representations.

Comparison to Concurrent Works.
1) VastGaussian [26] focuses mostly on the data splitting
strategy and guaranteeing the consistency of different 3D Gaussians can also be a challenge in
different scenes. However, our method ensured the consistency of the shared 3D Gaussians through
the 3D Gaussian consensus with only a quite simple splitting approach. Nonetheless, the data splitting
approach in VastGaussian can be introduced into our framework to enhance the robustness. Moreover,
the decoupled appearance encoding can also be applied to our method to reduce floaters. Our work
and VastGaussian are thus complementary to each other. 2) Hierarchy-GS [22] also trains 3DGS
distributedly in different grid cells. However, Hierarchy-GS focuses more on the rendering speed by
designing a hierarchical tree structure for 3D Gaussians. During training, the generated hierarchy is
loaded and optimized by randomly selecting a training view and a target granularity. After training all
individual chunks, Hierarchy-GS first runs a coarse initial optimization on the full dataset and adds
an auxiliary skybox. This coarse model serves as a minimal basis for providing backdrop details for
parts of the scene that are outside of a chunk. When consolidating different chunks, a 3D Gaussian
primitive is deleted if it is associated to-but outside-chunk and is closer to another chunk to maintain
the consistency of 3D Gaussians. The naive pruning approach neglects the gradient flow of the 3D
Gaussians to other 3D Gaussians that are inside only in an associated chunk. Therefore, its rendering
quality can be worse than VastGaussian and our method. Nonetheless, its hierarchical LOD approach
can still serve as a good complement to our method and VastGaussian.

Social Impact.
DOGS, VastGaussian and Hierarchy-GS focus on different parts of training 3D
GS on large-scale scenes and therefore are complementary to each other. These methods can
be consolidated into a more robust and scalable system to open a new world in city-scale 3D
reconstruction. Our method, however, requires an additional master node for controlling the training
of the 3DGS, which consumes more GPU resources.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Refer to the abstract and the last paragraph of Sec. 1 for our contribution.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please refer to Sec. A.8 in the appendix for the limitations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

20


---Page Break---
Justification: Proofs can be found in Sec. A.1 and Sec. A.2 in the appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Implementation details are included in Sec. 4 in the main paper. Additional
implementation details are included in Sec. A.6 in the supplementary. Pseudo algorithms
are included Sec. A.4 and Sec. A.5 in the supplementary for better understanding and
reproducing the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental

Justification: We will release related code and checkpoints upon the acceptance of the paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Training and testing details are included in Sec. 4 in the main paper. Additional
details are included in Sec. A.6 in the supplementary.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We follow related works for the setting of error bar.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

22


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Compute resources and running time are included in Sec. 4 in the main paper
and Sec. A.6 in the supplementary.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We strictly follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Societal impacts is included in Sec. A.9 in the supplementary.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

23


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper has no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We included the urls and cited the papers for code and datasets used in this
paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We use and cite existing datasets in this work. Other assets including related
code/models will be released upon acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
