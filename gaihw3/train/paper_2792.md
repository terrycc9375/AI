Abstract

We present VisionLLM v2, an end-to-end generalist multimodal large model
(MLLM) that unifies visual perception, understanding, and generation within a
single framework. Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM
v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional
visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision
tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing.
To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed “super
link”, as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only
allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the
MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training
conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of
tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public
vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained
end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using
a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance
comparable to task-specific models. We believe VisionLLM v2 will offer a new
perspective on the generalization of MLLMs.

Introduction

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [8, 97, 223, 107, 105, 140, 14, 169, 34, 33] have
recently made significant progress, demonstrating outstanding performance across various vision-
language tasks, even in scenarios requiring complex understanding and reasoning. However, a notable
limitation is that current MLLM outputs are in text form, which significantly constrains their capacity
to represent structured or visual information. Some researchers [140, 182, 181, 180] have expanded
the text-based output formats of MLLMs to better align with downstream tasks. While these efforts
have shown promise, they have not fully addressed practical needs such as dense object detection,
pose estimation, and image generation.

To overcome this limitation, a line of research [116, 187, 166, 111, 117, 47] enhances the capabilities
of MLLMs by transmitting task information to tools via text messages, as illustrated in Figure 1(a).
Despite these advances, these text-based methods are restricted by the information that text can
convey. They are not end-to-end, and the feedback gradient from the tools cannot be relayed back

MLLM connected to various downstream tools via text messages, capable of handling multiple tasks
but suffering from inefficient information transfer. (b) The embedding-based method displays a

to the MLLM. This limitation has spurred another research direction [89, 148, 193, 44, 83, 164]
that employs learnable embeddings as intermediaries to connect MLLM with one specific task
decoder (see Figure 1(b)). However, the naive embedding connection is difficult to scale to multi-task
scenarios. A routing mechanism is needed to ensure the correct selection of tools, and the issue of
task conflicts [224] arising from joint multi-task training is also a problem that needs to be considered.
Therefore, developing an end-to-end MLLM generalist for various vision and vision-language tasks
beyond text output remains a significant challenge.

Given these challenges, developing an end-to-end generalist MLLM requires a more effective
information transmission method than conventional text messages and naive embeddings. This
method should ensure that task information and feedback gradients are accurately and flexibly
communicated between the central MLLM and multi-task decoders while preventing task conflicts
across various visual domains and input/output formats. In addition, multi-task datasets for generalist
MLLMs need to be well-prepared. Despite the abundance of annotations in the community, the
diverse and inconsistent formats of these annotations across different tasks make it challenging to
develop a unified dataset that effectively supports multi-task learning.

In this work, we introduce VisionLLM v2, an end-to-end generalist MLLM designed for a wide array
of vision and vision-language tasks. This model not only performs typical visual question answering
but also extends to image generation, image editing, and open-ended object detection/instance
segmentation/pose estimation across diverse image domains. To facilitate information transmission
between the MLLM and multiple downstream task decoders, we introduce the super link technique,
which consists of two components: (1) Routing Token: special tokens (e.g., [DET], [POSE], and
[GEN]) added to the MLLM’s vocabulary. Whenever the MLLM predicts a specific routing token,
it triggers the selection of the appropriate decoder. (2) Super-Link Queries randomly initialized
learnable weights bound to the routing tokens. These queries are appended after the routing tokens
and processed by the MLLM to extract task-specific information, which is then sent to the target
decoder. This method enables flexible task information transmission, allows decoder gradients to
backpropagate to the MLLM, and avoids task conflicts by ensuring the queries are bound to routing
tokens and not shared across tasks.

Furthermore, we carefully collected and curated training data from hundreds of public vision and
vision-language tasks to support various tasks. The data includes high-quality examples of visual
question answering, visual perception, recognition, and understanding tasks from various sources
such as natural scenes, remote sensing images, medical images, and industrial images. To ensure
effective training with these extensive datasets, we also implemented a multi-stage joint training
strategy, integrating new abilities and reaching a performance comparable to the expert models while
maintaining the MLLM’s foundational VQA capabilities.

These designs endow VisionLLM v2 with three distinct characteristics: (1) Generality. With one suit
of parameters, our model can be generalized to different tasks using different text and visual prompts.
To our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end model to support hundreds of vision-language tasks while
achieving performance comparable to expert models. (2) Openness. By employing open-ended
decoders, our model allows users to freely define tasks through multimodal prompts, breaking away
from the constraints of closed-set models limited to predefined tasks or categories. Furthermore,

2


---Page Break---
users can flexibly combine various tasks into more complex ones through multi-round dialogue.
(3) Multimodal In-Context Ability. With multimodal inputs and outputs, our model demonstrates
extensive versatility and exhibits superiority over the previous in-context models with single-modal
outputs [184, 8]. These features distinguish our model from previous approaches, and establish a
leading foundational MLLM for various vision and vision-language applications.

In summary, our main contributions are listed as follows:

(1) We propose VisionLLM v2, the first end-to-end generalist MLLM model to accomplish hundreds
of vision and vision-language tasks1, covering visual perception, understanding, and generation. It
not only addresses the limitation of LLMs being confined to text outputs but also supports using
textual, visual, and in-context instructions to flexibly combine tasks for real-world applications.

(2) We introduce the super-link technique, which integrates the MLLM with task-specific decoders.
This integration facilitates end-to-end optimization across both linguistic and visual tasks. Addition-
ally, we meticulously collect and re-organize data from a broad range of domains and develop an
in-context learning dataset. These efforts lay a solid foundation for our progressive joint training
process and enable the model to benefit from individual tasks.

(3) We comprehensively evaluate the proposed model on a wide range of vision and vision-language
tasks, from visual perception to visual understanding, from weak interaction (e.g., closed-set) to
strong interaction (e.g., visual prompt + language prompt), from common-seen domains to long-tailed
domains (e.g., medical, remote-sensing, industry), as shown in the rightmost subfigure of Figure
1. In addition, with a generalist model, our method achieves comparable performance with the
task-specialized models in various standard benchmarks.

2.1
Multimodal Large Language Model

Conventional MLLMs. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs) [145, 146, 21, 215,
171, 37, 172, 13, 170, 9, 103, 7, 59, 43, 22], multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have also
gained significant momentum recently. Notable commercial models include GPT-4V [2], Gemini
series [169, 150], Claude-3 [10], and Qwen-VL-Max [14], known for their outstanding performance.
Early open-source MLLMs like InstructBLIP [42], LLaVA [107] and MiniGPT-4 [223] fine-tune on
instruction-following datasets. InternVL [34, 33] series models align a large-scale vision encoder
with LLMs and perform comparably to commercial models. Efficient MLLMs [100, 228, 38] have
also studied. However, these models only can output text, restricting their applications.

Extension of MLLMs’ Text Output. To extend MLLMs to downstream tasks, models like Kosmo-
2 [140], Shikra [27], VisionLLM [182], Ferret [201, 212], and All-Seeing V2 [180] achieve this
using specially-designed tokens or encoding coordinates as text tokens. Despite these advancements,
using LLMs solely as visual decoders falls short of resolving the fine-grained visual context needed
for precise detection and segmentation. The other line of works focus on broadening the modality
scope. AnyGPT [210] builds a multimodal text-centric dataset for any-to-any multimodal generation
(text, image, speech, music) with sequence modeling. Chameleon [168] uses fully token-based
representations for both texts and images, capable of understanding and generating interleaved image-
text sequences. CM3leon [5, 205] are autoregressive models for text-to-image and image-to-text
tasks. All these works could unify image understanding and generation in one network. Our model
can support more vision and vision-language tasks.

MLLMs w/ Downstream Tools. Recent works [116, 187, 166, 111, 117, 47, 17, 191, 68, 48] have
integrated external tools for vision-centric tasks, transmitting task information to these tools via text
messages. However, such text-based communication between LLMs and tools hinders end-to-end
optimization. Another category of approaches [89, 148, 218, 83, 164, 163, 53, 54, 136, 44, 50, 69]
feeds the output embeddings of LLMs into a special decoder and trains them end-to-end to enhance
information communication. However, they only support semantic segmentation or image generation
tasks. In this work, we target to develop an end-to-end MLLM generalist for diverse vision and
vision-language tasks beyond text output.

1We consider tasks such that those with differing input and output formats, or those involving data from
different domains as distinct tasks.

2.2
Vision Generalist Model

Unified Vision Model. The unified model approach integrates multiple visual tasks into a single
framework, enhancing efficiency and reducing the complexity of deploying separate models for each
task. Works such as Pix2Seq-D [29], SEEM [230], and Semantic-SAM [93] focus on unifying the
segmentation interface, achieving promising results. Grounding-DINO [112] and VisionLLM [182]
explore open-set detection grounded by language, while UniPose [198] excels in pose estimation.
Additionally, pioneering works [227, 224, 95, 121, 229, 189] aim to design a unified model capable of
solving multiple tasks, including detection, segmentation, captioning, etc. Their results demonstrate
the feasibility of a single model performing diverse tasks.

Visual Prompting. Visual prompting has emerged as a novel paradigm by providing visual marks in
the input instruction. It requires the model to pay attention to the specific region on the image when
answering the question. Techniques like red circle [157], SoM [196], AutoVP [173], ILM-VP [24],
and PIVOT [131] significantly reduce the need for textual prompt engineering, assisting models in
focusing on relevant visual content. Similar to in-context learning in LLMs, Painter [183], DINO
v2 [91], and SegGPT [184] leverage visual context to improve learning efficiency and adaptability,
enabling models to adapt to new tasks with minimal input.

Diffusion Model as Interface. Diffusion models are a flexible interface between users and visual
tasks, facilitating a more intuitive interaction paradigm. InstructCV [51] and InstructDiffusion [56]
exemplify using of natural language instructions to guide visual generation and manipulation. Pix2Seq
v2 [30] showcases the potential of diffusion models in generating sequences of visual tokens, bridging
the gap between vision and language.

Different from these works, our VisionLLM v2 integrating LLMs extends vision generalist to support
a broader range of vision-language tasks and explore various visual prompting paradigms, thereby
significantly broadening the scope of application.

VisionLLM v2

3.1
Model Design

The overall architecture of VisionLLM v2 is depicted in Figure 2. It mainly consists of four parts: (1)
an image encoder and a region encoder that encode the image-level and region-level information; (2)
a large language model (LLM) that models the multimodal inputs and generates satisfactory textual
responses; (3) a series of task-specific decoders for performing downstream tasks; (4) a super link
that uses routing tokens and super-link queries for efficient and conflict-free information transmission.
We detail each component in the following.

Tokenization. VisionLLM v2 is flexible for handling multimodal input. (1) For text prompts, we
employ the text tokenizer to tokenize them into distinct vocabulary indices, which can be further
processed by LLM and result in the text features Ftext ∈RL×C, where L denotes the length of input
text, and C is the channel dimension of LLM.

(2) For an image input, we utilize a pre-trained vision foundation model, such as CLIP [144], to extract
image features. Recognizing that current vision models operate the images at a low resolution, we
adopt the dynamic resolution approach [33] to process the input images. Specifically, the input image
is first automatically matched to an optimal aspect ratio from a predefined ratio set. Subsequently, the
image is scaled up to a higher resolution based on the selected aspect ratio and divided into P square
patches, each whose resolutions are 336×336. These local patches, along with a 336×336 global
image Iglobal, are processed by the image encoder to capture both holistic scenes and fine-grained
details, resulting in image features Fimg ∈R576(P +1)×C.

(3) For a visual prompt, we employ binary masks to flexibly represent the visual prompts, such as
point, box, scribble, and mask. To extract the region embedding, we first concatenate the binary mask
with the input image along the channel dimension and then process it with three convolutional layers
to downsample by a factor of 14 (see appendix for more details). We further augment this feature
map by adding the feature map of the global image Iglobal. Finally, grid sampling is used to extract
features within the masked regions, and these features are averaged to form the features of the visual
prompt Fvprt ∈R1×C.

Large Language Model. Following previous works [107, 213, 60], both the images and visual
prompts are projected to the feature space of the LLM. The LLM plays a central role in our model

Figure 2: Overall architecture of the proposed VisionLLM v2. It receives the image and text/visual
prompts as inputs. The central LLM parses the user instructions and generates the textual responses.
Besides outputting the plain text, LLM can also output the special routing token such as [DET] when
needed. The super-link queries would be automatically appended after the routing token embeddings
and further processed by LLM. They play as the bridge for connecting LLM and task-specific
decoders. In this way, our generalist model can support hundreds of visual tasks. The detailed
architecture about connecting the LLM with task-specific decoders can be found in Figure A13.

and is used to model multimodal inputs, parse user instructions, and generate appropriate responses.
In this work, we adopt the commonly used Vicuna-7B [219] as the LLM in our network.

Task-specific Decoders. To enhance the capacities of MLLM, we equip our model with several
task-specific decoders. Specifically, we use Grounding DINO [112] for object-level localization. We
additionally add a mask decoder upon it to obtain the segmentation ability. For pose estimation, we
adopt UniPose [198] as the keypoint decoder. Moreover, we incorporate Stable Diffusion [152] and
InstructPix2Pix [20] as the image decoders, endowing our model with the capability to generate
and edit images. We discard these decoders’ text encoders and link them with MLLM via the super
link technique, which will be detailed explained in Section 3.2. In this way, the decoders can be
trained end-to-end with the entire network, ensuring the effective transmission of task information
and increasing the openness of these decoders.

3.2
Super Link Technique

For the text-only output tasks, such as image-level and region-level VQA, we directly take the plain
text generated by LLM as the final output. For visual perception and visual generation tasks, we
propose the super link technique to tackle the challenge of selecting the appropriate decoder, avoiding
task conflicts, and facilitating effective information transmission between the LLM and the decoders.
The super link comprises two parts:

(1) Routing Token. We add the routing tokens, e.g., [DET], [POSE], [SEG], [GEN], [EDIT], as
special tokens to the original LLM vocabulary. When the model intends to complete the downstream
task using one of the decoders, LLM would include the corresponding routing token in its textual
response. To enable the model to discern which tasks to perform and which routing tokens to output,
we construct a series of instruction templates for different tasks using ChatGPT [4].

(2) Super-Link Queries. For each decoder, we define the super-link queries as a fixed set of embed-
dings denoted as Qlink ∈RN×C, where N is the number of queries. They are randomly initialized
and serve as the bridge between LLM and task-specific decoders. Whenever the LLM predicts the
routing token, the super-link queries would be automatically appended after the input embeddings
of the routing token. We then extract their corresponding last-layer hidden states Hlink and apply
an MLP projection to obtain ˆHlink. Finally, ˆHlink is sent into the specific decoders as a condition to
perform the downstream tasks. In the following, we illustrate how to integrate ˆHlink into decoders for
visual perception and generation, respectively.

Visual Perception covers a wide range of visual tasks, such as open-ended/closed-set object detection,
instance segmentation, pose estimation, etc. VisionLLM v2 supports using both text and visual
prompts to define these tasks. We list an example in the following figure. <image> and <region>
are the placeholders that will be replaced by image and region embeddings before being fed into
the LLM. Here, we take Example 1 of interactive segmentation for clarification. The user prompts
the model to segment specific regions within a question. MLLM sequentially lists the region names
followed by a routing token [SEG] in the response. Remember that the proposed method would
automatically append the super-link queries after the routing token. In that way, we can obtain the

5


---Page Break---
per-region representations by extracting the output hidden states of MLLM from corresponding super-
link queries and pooling them into one embedding. These embeddings are fed into a segmentation
decoder as the conditional feature, requiring only a single forward to produce segmentation results
for all regions. In the following, we show a template example for interactive segmentation.

Example1: Text Prompt + Visual Prompt for Interactive Segmentation.
USER: <image> Could you please segment all the corresponding objects according to the visual
prompts as region1 <region>, region2 <region>?
ASSISTANT: Sure, these objects are region1 [SEG], region2 [SEG].

Visual Generation is also a wide topic covering a number of different tasks, such as generation,
editing, variation, personalization, etc. In VisionLLM v2, we focus on two fundamental tasks, i.e.,
text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing. We use Stable Diffusion v1.5 (SD) as
our tool in the text-to-image generation task. We abandon its text encoder and use the output hidden
states of the MLLM as the image generation condition for SD. Image editing task [82] can also be
accomplished in the same paradigm by using both image and text prompts as inputs. In the following,
we list a template example for text-to-image generation.

Example 2: Text Prompt for Text-to-Image Generation.
ASSISTANT: Of course, here it is [GEN].

Discussion. Some previous works have used the special token or learnable queries independently.
InstructBLIP [42], ep-ALM [158], and MAPL [125] use learnable queries (i.e., soft prompts) to
connect the modality encoders and LLM. FROMAGe [84] uses a special token for image-text retrieval
so as to handle multimodal outputs, where the images are not generated from the network end-to-end.
However, these works still remain constrained to text-based outputs. The proposed super link is
the seamless integration of the two techniques. Despite the simplicity of our method, it is able to
extend MLLMs to handle hundreds of tasks by largely extending the output formats, e.g., box, mask,
keypoint and image. Meanwhile, it can address several challenges when scaling up various tasks: (i)
precise decoder invocation, (ii) mitigating task conflicts and (iii) efficient message transmission in an
end-to-end manner.

3.3
Training Strategy

Current MLLMs [89, 218, 44] face reduced conversational abilities when augmented with additional
capacities. To create a generalist model capable of handling hundreds of tasks without compromising
vision understanding, we propose a three-stage training strategy, where the first stage focuses on
building an MLLM with strong image-level and region-level vision understanding. In the subsequent
stages, we add task-specific decoders and continue training to equip the model with advanced
capabilities.

Stage-1: Mutimodal Training. In the first stage, we follow the training settings of LLaVA [107, 105],
comprising pre-training and instruction tuning phases. The pre-training phase aims to establish the
image-level and region-level vision-language alignment, where only the region encoder and the
projections for image embedding and region embedding are trained for efficiency. The instruction
tuning phase unfreezes the LLM and trains the model on a wide range of high-quality instruction data.
After the training in this stage, we can obtain a strong MLLM with excellent conversation ability,
which we term as VisionLLM v2-Chat.

Stage-2: Multi-capacity Fine-tuning. At this stage, we integrate task-specific decoders into the
model and perform multi-task joint training. In addition to the instruction data utilized in stage-1, we
incorporate extensive visual datasets such as COCO [104], ADE20K [222] for their specific tasks.
We construct a series of instruction templates for these visual datasets to perform instruction tuning,
ensuring that the LLM can accurately invoke the downstream decoders. During this stage, the region
encoder and all decoders undergo training, and we only finetune the input and output embeddings of
the LLM to maximally preserve its original conversational ability.

Stage-3: Decoder-only Fine-tuning. Since the decoders cannot converge within a single epoch, we
further train the decoders for 12 epochs using visual datasets while freezing all other components.
It is noted that the super-link queries continue to be trained during this stage. After finishing the
three-stage training, our model has diverse capacities for visual tasks while maintaining effectiveness
in global vision understanding, named VisionLLM v2.

Experiments

4.1
Implementation Details

Dataset Details. To support the joint training of our model, we meticulously collect and re-organize
the datasets across a wide range of tasks from publicly available sources. For the first stage training,
we utilize a substantial amount of high-quality instruction data for both image-level and region-level
visual question answering, including ShareGPT4V [28], All-Seeing [181], VQAv2 [57], etc. In the last
two stages, we further incorporate extensive visual datasets, e.g., COCO [104], RefCOCO/+/g [204,
126], LAION-Aesthetics [3], to enhance our model with numerous capacities. These datasets
encompass multiple tasks such as object detection, pose estimation, image generation, and span
various domains such as natural scenes, remote sensing images, medical images, etc. To facilitate the
training of diverse datasets in our MLLM framework, we construct a series of instruction templates
for different tasks, which are completely listed in the Appendix. Additionally, we also collect a
multimodal dataset termed MMIC focusing on visual prompting and in-context learning. The data in
our MMIC comes from various sources, including fine-grained visual recognition, object detection,
instance segmentation, and pose detection. We elaborate on all datasets used in this work as well as
the dataset construction of MMIC in the Appendix.

Model Details. We adopt the CLIP-L/14 [144] as the image encoder and Vicuna-7B-v1.5 [219]
as the language model. Grounding-DINO [112] and UniPose [198] are selected as object decoder
and keypoint decoder, respectively. And for these two decoders, we experiment with Swin-T [115]
backbone. Additionally, image decoders are kept as Stable Diffusion v1.5 [152] for image generation
and InstructPix2Pix [20] for image editing. All these components load the pre-trained weights while
the region encoder is randomly initialized. For visual perception and visual generation tasks, the
number N of super-link queries is set to 4 and 64, respectively. During training, we adjust the
dataloader so that each GPU processes samples from only one dataset. More training details are
provided in the Appendix.

In the following subsections, we present the experimental results to cover as many tasks, interactive
modes, and domains. It is noted that all the results of our method are reported using a single
generalist model with the same parameters. More results can be found in the Appendix.

4.2
Mutimodal Benchmarks

Multimodal Dialogue. We first evaluate our models on academic-oriented VQA datasets and recent
instruction-following datasets for MLLMs, as presented in Table 1. The results clearly demonstrate
that our models outperform previous methods under the same parameter scale, particularly on
the instruction-following datasets. For instance, VisionLLM v2-Chat surpasses LLaVA-NeXT-
7B [106] by +9.7 and +7.0 points on MMBench-EN/CN [114], respectively. Additionally, we find
that VisionLLM v2 achieves comparable performance to VisionLLM v2-Chat on these multimodal
benchmarks and even performs better on some benchmarks, such as POPE [101], a popular benchmark
for evaluating object hallucination. This phenomenon indicates that our framework effectively
mitigates the issue of multi-task conflict and maintains proficiency in conversational ability.

Table 4: Comparison of pose estimation performance. ∗indicates that the results rely on ground-
truth bounding boxes for top-down methods.

Region Recognition. The region recognition task needs the model to identify the object category
given the ground-truth bounding box. We compare our method with both feature-based and text-
output approaches in Table 2a. Feature-based methods, such as RegionCLIP [221] and ASM [181],
compute similarity scores between region visual features and candidate category text features. In
contrast, text-output methods [25, 60, 207] directly predict the category name using a single word or
phrase, embracing the advantage of openness. As shown in the table, our models demonstrate the
significant superior performance on COCO [104], long-tail LVIS [61] and part-level PACO [147].

Visual Commonsense Reasoning. Visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) requires the model to
possess strong region-level question-answering and reasoning abilities, as it needs to select not only
the correct answer but also the correct rationale behind it. We present the comparison results on the
VCR dataset [209] in Table 2b. Without task-specific fine-tuning, VisionLLM v2-Chat achieves an
accuracy of 82.9% in the crucial Q→AR task, which precedes the previous best model, ASMv2 [180],
by +3.5 points. VisionLLM v2 also outperforms the previous methods for all the metrics, highlighting
the promising common sense reasoning capability of our model.

4.3
Visual Perception Tasks

Object Detection and Instance Segmentation. In Table 3, we compare the results of VisionLLM v2
with state-of-the-art methods on two fundamental vision tasks, i.e., object detection, and instance
segmentation. As can be seen, using the lightweight backbone Swin-T, our generalist model achieves

the performance of 56.7 APb and 47.8 APm on COCO. The results significantly outperform the
previous methods using ResNet50 [64] backbone and are comparable with the specialist model
Grounding-DINO-T [112]. Moreover, we also validate our model on the crowded pedestrian detection
dataset, i.e., CrowdHuman. VisionLLM v2 surpasses the previous best generalist model Hulk [185]
by 0.9 points on AP50.

Pose Estimation. We present the results on the multiple pose estimation dataset in Table 4. While
most previous methods [197, 194, 108] only focus on the person scenes, our VisionLLM v2 is
effective in performing the keypoint detection for multiple objects. As shown in the table, our
model achieves competitive performance with UniPose-T [198] using the same Swin-T backbone.
Especially, our model demonstrates the superior performance on AP-10K [203] and Macaque [88]
datasets and sets a new state-of-the-art result on CrowdPose [96]. These results prove the effectiveness
of our model for pose estimation.

4.4
Visual Generation Tasks
We evaluate the generation capabilities of our model on two tasks, i.e., text-to-image generation
and instruction-based image editing. In Figure 3, we demonstrate that even if our model uses
Stable Diffusion v1.5 as an image decoder, it achieves better visual quality than SD v1.5 with better
conditional embedding produced by LLM. Moreover, the use of LLM for conditional encoding
of user instructions makes it possible to benefit from the merits of LLM. For example, our model
trained on English data is able to perform zero-shot bilingual image generation. Besides, we show
the qualitative results of applying our model for instruction-based image editing, which also achieves
appealing performance in a unified approach.

4.5
Ablation Study
In the ablation studies, we follow the training setup of stage-2 unless otherwise specified. We only
train our model on the crucial visual perception tasks, i.e., instance segmentation, visual grounding,
pose estimation, and interactive segmentation, for rapid validation.

Super-Link Queries Number. We ablate the number N of super-link queries in Table 5. We observe
that the performance of these tasks consistently improves with an increasing number of queries. This
is reasonable as more queries can lead to richer and stronger representations.

Shared vs.Unshared Super-Link Queries for Different Decoders. To determine if one set of
super-link queries is sufficient for all decoders, we conducted an ablation study by either using shared
queries for all decoders or defining separate queries for each decoder. In this ablation, we only train
the decoders and super-link queries while freezing all other components as the training setting of
stage-3. In Figure 4, we plot the performance of box AP (using the object decoder) and keypoint
AP (using the keypoint decoder) on COCO. We observe that the keypoint AP would decrease over
training when using shared queries, which may be attributed to the fact that most data are used for
object decoder. Besides, the box AP with shared queries is also inferior to decoupled ones. Therefore,
we define separate super-link queries for each decoder in our model.

Multi-Task Influence. As indicated by previous works [225, 206], different tasks with shared
parameters may cause conflict with each other. This is mainly due to inconsistent optimization in
multi-task learning. To investigate the mutual influence of multi-task joint training in our framework,
we start from the same checkpoint and train the model on a single task (image VQA, instance
segmentation, or image generation) for 1000 iterations. We record the loss change for all three tasks
in Table 6. In the table, a decrease in the loss value indicates beneficial training for the task, while
an increase is detrimental. We can observe that training on image VQA is advantageous for all
three tasks, which is reasonable as the conversation ability of MLLM is enhanced. Whereas training
exclusively on instance segmentation or image generation leads to conflicts with other tasks. This
aligns with the findings in Uniperceiver-MoE [225].

One-Stage vs.Three-Stage Training. Some previous generalist models [176, 15] train the model
in one stage. Our model encompasses much more tasks and thus introduces a training conflict: the
MLLM requires only 1 epoch of training on chat data to prevent overfitting, whereas the decoders
need longer training epochs (e.g., Grounding-DINO need 12 epochs of training on visual data) to
achieve convergence. One possible solution for one-stage training is to give a higher sample ratio
for the visual data. In the following, we conduct the ablation to study the effect of one-stage v.s.
three-stage training. We use image-level chat data, COCO, and COCO-Pose for image understanding,
instance segmentation, and pose estimation, respectively. For one-stage training, we repeat the COCO
and COCO-Pose datasets 12 times. As can be seen from Table 7, the conversation ability of the
model is significantly decreased due to extreme data imbalance. And the performance of instance
segmentation and pose estimation is also slightly reduced. These results prove the effectiveness of
our three-stage training.

Conclusion & Limitation

In this paper, we presented VisionLLM v2, a comprehensive MLLM that unifies visual perception,
understanding, and generation within a single framework. The proposed super link mechanism facili-
tates flexible information transmission between the MLLM and task-specific decoders, addressing
training conflicts and enhancing gradient feedback. Experiments show that VisionLLM v2 achieves
performance comparable to specialized models while maintaining broad applicability.

Regarding limitations, our model’s training encompasses three stages, which are relatively complex.
Moreover, the integration of downstream tools has only been preliminarily validated. Future work will
further explore solutions to these issues, aiming to enhance the model’s performance and efficiency.

Broader Impact. We envision that this work will further promote the fusion of visual and language
tasks. In addition, since our work is built on open-source pre-trained vision foundation models and
large language models, requiring low training resources, thus reducing the carbon footprint. We do
not foresee obvious undesirable ethical/social impacts at this moment.

More Results

A.1
More Experimental Results

Region Captioning. To access the region understanding capabilities of VisionLLM v2, we evaluate
our models on two prominent benchmarks: RefCOCOg [126] and Visual Genome [86]. The results
are presented in Table A1b. Notably, VisionLLM v2-Chat significantly outperforms the state-of-the-
art methods, with the improvements of +8.6 and +8.4 points in CIDEr scores on RefCOCOg [126]
and Visual Genome (validation subset) [86, 148], respectively. The generalist VisionLLM v2 also
shows promising performance on RefCOCOg. These results demonstrate the strong fine-grained
region captioning capabilities of our model.

Visual Grounding. Visual grounding is a crucial vision task that associates the language description
with the specific object within an image. Using the box or mask as the output format, visual grounding
can be further categorized into referring expression comprehension (REC) and referring expression
segmentation (RES) tasks. We comprehensively list the comparison results for the two tasks in
Table A2 and Table A3, respectively. From Table A2, it is found that VisionLLM v2 achieves the
competitive performance on RefCOCO [204] among MLLMs. We also showcase that VisionLLM v2
exhibits remarkable pixel-level segmentation capacities in Table A3. Without further fine-tuning, our
model demonstrates the good gIoU result of 51.0 on the challenging ReasonSeg dataset [89].

Semantic Segmentation. In addition to the instance-level segmentation, our model also has the
capacity to address the task of semantic segmentation. We present the results on ADE20K [222]
in Table A4. The previous works mainly follow the standard training setting for 160k iterations
on 8 GPUs with a total batch size of 16. As ADE20K only constitutes a small proportion of our
joint-training dataset, our generalist model has a slightly inferior performance on this dataset. By
fine-tuning this dataset with fewer training iterations, i.e., 45k, VisionLLM v2 can achieve a mIoU of
52.3 points, surpassing the previous methods under the same backbone.

Interactive Segmentation. Interactive segmentation [82] is an emerging task that uses visual prompts
as conditions for instance segmentation. We compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches
on the COCO-interactive dataset [218] in Table A5. This dataset, proposed by [218], utilizes points,
scribbles, boxes, and masks as visual prompts and is annotated on the COCO dataset [104]. As shown
in the table, our generalist model VisionLLM v2 demonstrates performance advantages over SEEM-
B [230] across all metrics but falls behind the recently proposed MLLM method PSALM [218]. We
hypothesize that this is due to our region encoder being frozen during stage-3 of training, which
constrains the model’s performance. Therefore, we further fine-tune our model on this task by
unfreezing the region encoder. It is observed that the performance of our model is significantly
improved, as illustrated in the last row of Table A5.

Evaluation on Various Domains.

Salient Object Detection. We compare the results of VisionLLM v2 with state-of-the-art methods
for salient object detection (SOD) in Table A6. Our model clearly achieves the highest performance
on 4 of the 5 classical benchmarks, demonstrating its strong object discovery capabilities.

Camouflaged Object Detection. The performance comparisons for camouflaged object detection
(COD) are presented in Table A7. It is observed that VisionLLM v2 exhibits competitive performance
with state-of-the-art expert models that undergo longer training schedule, e.g., 150 epochs.

Visualization across various domains. Besides the quantitative results, we also display the visual-
ization results of VisionLLM v2 across various domains. As illustrated in Figure A1, our model also
shows strong perception capacities for remote sensing, PCB, and medical images.

A.3
Zero-shot Evaluation and In-Context Evaluation

Zero-shot Image Captioning. Benefiting from the joint training on large-scale vision-language
datasets, VisionLLM v2 exhibits promising capacities for zero-shot image captioning. As shown
in Table A1a, both VisionLLM v2-Chat and VisionLLM v2 achieve competitive performance on
Flickr30K [142] and NoCaps [6] compared with previous methods.

Zero-shot Object Detection on OdinW13. We conduct the zero-shot object detection evaluation on
OdinW13 dataset [98], as shown in Table A8. The results demonstrate that our VisionLLM v2 with a
Swin-Tiny backbone is even on par with GLEE-Plus [190] with a Swin-Large backbone in APavg.
This indicates that our model benefits from the extensive dataset joint training, thereby providing
robust general object detection capabilities.

In-Context Segmentation & In-Context Image Captioning. To
evaluate the in-context learning ability of VisionLLM v2, we com-
pare the results of in-context segmentation and in-context image
captioning in Table A9. For in-context segmentation, we construct
a benchmark based on the validation set of COCO2017, where the
number of in-context examples used during inference ranges from
1 to 5. For in-context image-captioning, we follow the same eval-
uation protocol as OpenFlamingo [11] and use 4-shot to assess the
performance between different methods. The validation set is built
upon COCO2017. From the table, VisionLLM v2 exhibits clear
performance advantages compared with state-of-the-art methods in
both in-context learning settings, which demonstrates the superior
in-context capacities of our method.

A.4
More Ablation Studies

Super-Link Queries v.s. Token Embeddings in LISA [89]. Current MLLMs [89, 148, 151]
introduce a segmentation token [SEG] into the LLM vocabulary and directly use its corresponding
token embedding as a condition for SAM [82] to achieve pixel-level segmentation, which we refer
to as the token embedding method. We also ablate this method for linking the LLM with task-
specific decoders, as shown in Table A10. The performance difference between the two methods
is negligible for tasks using text prompts, such as instance segmentation. We hypothesize that
this is because the category names are seen during training, allowing the token embeddings to

effectively capture category semantics. However, our super-link queries method outperforms the
token embedding method for more open-ended tasks, such as interactive segmentation with visual
prompts, demonstrating the greater flexibility of our approach.

We emphasize two fundamental differences between the two methods: (1) The token embedding
method requires sequential prediction of the special tokens during inference, which is time-consuming
when the number of tokens is large. In contrast, our super-link technique requires only a single
forward pass and the super-link queries would be automatically appended. This is efficient for cases
requiring many tokens, such as image generation. (2) The super-link queries are not constrained
by the cross-entropy loss of the LLM, allowing for more flexible and stronger representations for
open-ended tasks.

A.5
Qualitative Results

Visual Perception. We evaluate VisionLLM v2 on various visual perception tasks and display
the visualization results from Figure A2 to Figure A6. The qualitative examples showcase that
VisionLLM v2 exhibits strong visual perception capacities, from coarse to fine-grained perception
(box, keypoint, pixel), from basic to novel classes, from commonly-seen domains to long-tailed
domains (natural scenes, industry, agriculture, etc).

Visual Generation. Figure A7 shows more text-to-image generation results of VisionLLM v2. It
could be observed that our model could generate high-quality images that not only properly follow
the concepts and relations but also different styles specified in the instructions. Figure A8 shows
more instructed-based image editing results of VisionLLM v2. Our model could successfully perform
image editing for over five types of editing instructions, such as style transfer, object replacement,
object addition, and attribute change.

More Architecture Details

B.1
Region Encoder

The region encoder is designed to encode various shaped visual prompts such as points, scribbles,
boxes, etc. Each visual prompt is represented by a binary mask. We first concatenate the binary
mask with the image along the channel dimension, resulting in a 4-channel input, denoted as
Ivprt ∈R4×H×W . The region encoder is implemented with three convolutional layers: the first layer
uses a kernel size of 7 and a stride of 7, the second layer employs a kernel size of 2, and a stride
of 2, and the final layer features a kernel size of 1 and a stride of 1. Each convolutional layer is
followed by layer normalization [12] and GELU activation [65]. This process downsamples the input
Ivprt ∈R4×H×W by a factor of 14. We further augment this feature map by adding the feature map of
the global image Iglobal. Finally, we use grid sampling to extract features within the masked regions
and pool them into a single region embedding Fvprt ∈R1×C.

are sent into the object decoder as text features. (b) Connecting with image decoder. We add a
Q-Former for projecting the features of super-link queries to the feature space of Stable Diffusion.

B.2
Task-specific Decoders

In this subsection, we provide more explanations about how to connect LLM with task-specific
decoders via super-link queries, which enables the end-to-end optimization of the entire network.

Connecting with Object Decoder. For visual perception tasks like object detection, we employ
Grounding DINO [112] as the object decoder to localize objects as well as classify their categories.
To achieve this, LLM would output each category name in the response, followed by a special token
[DET] and super-link queries. We then obtain the per-category features by extracting the hidden
states of LLM for corresponding super-link queries and pooling them into one embedding. Grounding
DINO receives both the image and the obtained per-category features as inputs and predicts the
detection results. The process is illustrated in Figure A13a. It is noted that we discard the text
encoder in the original Ground DINO and use the obtained per-category features as text features to
perform the vision-language alignment for classification. During training, the total loss includes the
cross-entropy loss of LLM and detection loss of the object decoder. Similarly, the keypoint decoder
is also integrated into the LLM in the same way and performs pose estimation.

Connecting with Image Decoder. We utilize Stable Diffusion [152] as the image decoder and take
the example of text-to-image generation for clarification, as depicted in Figure A13b. The super-link
queries are appended after the special token [GEN] in the LLM’s response. After passing through
the LLM, an MLP layer and a lightweight Q-Former [97, 83] module are added to project the features
of the super-link queries into the representation space of Stable Diffusion, i.e., mapping features.
We bypass the text encoder in Stable Diffusion and directly use the mapping features as the text
embedding condition. During training, in addition to the next token loss in the LLM, we employ two
MSE losses for supervision: one between the encoded text features by CLIP [144] and the mapping
features, and the other between the ground-truth images/noise and predicted images/noise.

More Dataset Details

To support the training for enhancing our model with various capacities, we meticulously collect
and re-organize the datasets from a broad range of tasks. These data are publicly available, and
we comprehensively list all the data we used in Table A11. In addition to the commonly used
dataset for the standard vision and vision-language tasks, we find that many works explore visual
prompting strategies and in-context learning. However, there is still a lack of public datasets focusing
on addressing these tasks currently. To this end, we organize a series of datasets into a new one
coined as a multimodal in-context (MMIC) dataset to facilitate the model with in-context learning
abilities, applicable to both visual and textual prompts. As shown in Table A12, built upon several
datasets, we support lots of visual prompting and in-context tasks for fine-grained visual recognition,

Figure A14: The training strategy of VisionLLM v2. It consists of three consecutive stages: (1)
multimodal training; (2) multi-capacity fine-tuning; (3) decoder-only fine-tuning. Leveraging this
training strategy, VisionLLM v2 progressively learns the global knowledge and enhances its capacities
from a broad range of data sources.

including categories such as cats, dogs, fruits, vegetables, food, cars, birds, etc. Additionally, we also
make efforts on in-context object detection, in-context object segmentation, in-context captioning,
in-context OCR, and in-context VAQ.

C.1
MMIC Dataset Construction

For tasks that require visual or textual in-context examples, we randomly select N samples, where
N ∈[2, 6], without replacement from the dataset. The first N −1 samples are presented as in-context
examples of the model. These examples serve to provide a reference or a guide for the type of output
expected. The model is then tasked with solving or completing the task based on the last sample in
the sequence. This paradigm allows the model to learn from examples and apply that knowledge to
new, unseen data.

Inspired by [157], visual marks can also serve as the input for multimodal LLMs. As a result, we
design five types of visual marks: circle, hand-drawn circle, arrow, box, and mask. Each visual mark
can be either solid or hollow. We primarily construct this dataset based on COCO [104], AP10K [203]
and some OCR datasets [165, 161], where we randomly sample M(∈[1, 5]) instances per image.
The same type of visual mark is used to highlight the selected instance within one image, ensuring
consistency and clarity for the model’s learning process.

The examples of constructed instructions can refer to Figure A9, A10, A11 and A12. The entire
dataset has constructed a multimodal corpus with ∼862K question&answer pairs. We expect that this
dataset can further advance the development of this field.

D
Training Details

Figure A14 depicts the three-stage training process. Table A13 lists the detailed training configurations
of VisionLLM v2 in different training stages. In each stage, the model inherits the weights from
the previous stage and continues training. The image encoder keeps frozen in all stages following
previous works [107, 105].

Settings of Stage-1. Stage-1 consists of pretraining and instruction tuning phases as [107, 105].
As shown in Table A13, in the pretraining phase, We freeze the LLM. And only the region encoder
and projections for image embedding and region embedding are trained for efficiency. We adopt the
AdamW optimizer [119] with the peak learning rate of 1e-3 and weight decay of 0. The training
involves a total batch size of 2048 across 64 A100 GPUs. In the instruction tuning phase, LLM
is unfrozen for full-parameter training. The peak learning rate is decreased to 2.5e-5 for training
stabilization. The model is trained on 64 A100 GPUs with a total batch size of 1024. And we begin
adopting the dynamic resolution approach [106, 33] in this phase. The maximal number of local
patches, i.e., max tile, is set as 4.

Table A13: Training settings of VisionLLM v2 in different stages. Max tile means the maximal
number of local patches when adopting the dynamic resolution approach [106, 33] for the images.

Settings of Stage-2. In stage-2, we add the task-specific decoders and perform the multi-capacity fine-
tuning. In this stage, we only finetune the input and output embeddings of LLM to save computational
memory and preserve the convesational ability. LLM and region encoder are trained with the peak
learning rate of 1e-5, while the decoders are trained with the peak learning rate of 1e-4. The model is
trained on 128 A100 GPUs with a batch size of 2 per GPU.

Settings of Stage-3. In stage-3, we freeze all the components except for the task-specific decoders to
maintain the conversational ability. The model undergoes 12 training epochs on 128 A100 GPUs
with a peak learning rate of 1e-4 and a total batch size of 256.

These three stages take around 5 / 3 / 10 days to finish the training, respectively.

Training Losses. During training, we use the standard cross-entropy loss in stage-1. In stage-2 and
stage-3, when integrating the task-specific decoders, we simply sum the losses from the LLM and
decoders directly, without reweighting each component. i.e.,

Ltotal = Lllm + Lgdino + Lunipose + Lsd + Lip2p
(1)

E
Instruction Templates

To support the proper invocation of task-specific decoders, we construct a series of instruction
templates for different tasks using ChatGPT [4] and use them as instruction tuning data for LLM. We
comprehensively list all the instruction templates below, from Table A14 to Table A24.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research,
addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove
the checklist: The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected. The checklist should
follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT
count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For
each question in the checklist:

• You should answer [Yes] , [No] , or [NA] .

• [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the
relevant information is Not Available.

• Please provide a short (1–2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission. They are visible to the
reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it
(after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published
with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation.
While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a
proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally
expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering
"[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we
acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and
write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the
supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification
please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

• Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading “NeurIPS paper checklist",

• Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.

• Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers.

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The main claims in the abstract and introduction accurately describe our
model’s contributions in the multimodal large language model domain.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

45


---Page Break---
Justification: See the conclusion section for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This paper provides detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, training
steps, and the datasets used. We will also release the code later.

Guidelines:

46


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: At the time of submission, we will not provide the code and dataset. We plan
to open-source the code and dataset in the future.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

47


---Page Break---
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The paper does not report error bars of the results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix D.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

48


---Page Break---
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, the research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See the conclusion section for details.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

49


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See the dataset details in Appendix A.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package
should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has
curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license
of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

50


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
