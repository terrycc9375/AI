Abstract

Multi-object 3D Grounding involves locating 3D boxes based on a given query
phrase from a point cloud. It is a challenging and significant task with numerous
applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics.
To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach incorporating
three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learn-
able number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts
features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module
that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically,
experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object
3D grounding.1

Introduction

Building agents that can operate in real-world environments with humans has been a fundamental
goal of artificial intelligence. Importantly, the agent would need to understand the 3D scene and
natural language to take instructions from humans. To benchmark these capabilities, there is an
increasing amount of interest in the task of object grounding in 3D [2, 4, 8, 17, 21, 23, 39, 40, 46, 50].
Recently, the task of multi-object 3D grounding [52] has been proposed, i.e., given a text description
and a 3D scene localize all objects referred by the description.

Along with the benchmark, Zhang et al. [52] proposes, M3DRef-CLIP, a two-stage approach that
first detects all the potential objects (capped at a maximum number) from the 3D scene, and then
reasons about which of the objects are relevant to the text description by extracting features for each
of the objects. Specifically, they leverage both 3D features from the point cloud, and 2D features
extracted from renderings of the detected objects at fixed camera poses. These object features along
with the text embedding are passed into a Transformer to make the final prediction. Model training is
formulated as multi-output classification, where each potential object is classified based on whether it
is referred to by the text.

In this work, we identify several directions in which M3DRef-CLIP could be improved. First, the
generation of object proposals is based on a fixed maximum. Prior work [30] points out the dilemma
of deciding the number of boxes in the 3D grounding task under the two-stage detection-and-selection
diagram. Excessive proposals may increase complexity and lead to redundant computations while
sparse proposals may miss critical information in the scene. Second, the camera poses of the renderer
are fixed to hand-selected viewpoints, which seems unlikely to be ideal given the variability in object
sizes. Third, the fusion module does not effectively reason over the spatial relationship of the objects
based on the text description.

To address these shortcomings, we propose D-LISA, a two-stage approach that incorporates three
innovative modules. First, instead of using all detected objects, we use a dynamic proposal module to
select the key box proposals. Second, we incorporate a dynamic multi-view renderer module that
optimizes the viewing angles tailored to a specific scene. Third, we introduce a language-informed
spatial fusion module that uses textual description to guide reasoning based on spatial relations.

To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments on the Multi3DRefer benchmark for
multi-object 3D grounding and achieve a substantial 12.8% absolute increase over the existing
baseline M3DRef-CLIP. We also validate the effectiveness of our method by achieving the state-of-
the-art performance on ScanRefer benchmark [8] and competitive results on Nr3D benchmark [2] for
single-object 3D grounding. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We introduce a dynamic box proposal module that automatically determines the key box proposals
for the later reasoning stage, which could potentially replace the fixed object proposals prevalent
in existing two-stage grounding pipelines. Also, we learn the camera pose for 2D rendering
dynamically based on the scene, enhancing the quality of auxiliary object features in uncertain
environments.
• We propose a language-informed spatial fusion module that dynamically captures the spatial
relations among objects, significantly improving the model’s contextual understanding and
performance in the multi-object 3D grounding task.
• We conduct thorough experiments to validate the proposed framework. The proposed approach
not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multi-object 3D grounding, but
also maintains robust performance in the single-object 3D grounding task.

Related Work

2D grounding aims to identify the target object in a 2D image based on a natural language description.
The conventional detection-and-selection two-stage pipeline first extracts the visual features for
the proposals and language features for the description then employs the attention mechanism to
effectively align the visual features and language features [15, 27, 42, 48, 55]. Alternatively, one-stage
methods directly regress the target boxes by integrating object detection and language understanding
[28, 33, 44, 45]. While relational graphs have been used to explicitly model the object relations in
2D images [29, 37, 43], extending the modeling to 3D is challenging due to larger number of objects
and more complex spatial relations.

3D grounding. Similar to 2D grounding, 3D grounding aims to target the language-referred object in
a 3D scene. There have been a variety of datasets [1, 2, 8] and approaches [5, 17, 39, 40, 50] to tackle
this challenging problem. M3DRef-CLIP [52] is the pioneered work to explore targeting multiple
objects that match the language description. Other than the one-stage methods that directly identify
the target box [30, 38], two-stage methods like M3DRef-CLIP following the detection-and-selection
diagram are facing the issue of determining the number of boxes from the detection stage. We propose
a module that dynamically selects the key box proposals from object candidates.

2D features have been widely used to assist with 3D grounding [4, 17, 21, 23, 46] as well as other 3D
tasks [3, 22, 31, 36, 47, 51]. However, most studies rely on fixed camera poses to generate these 2D
image features, which is sub-optimal given the varying object sizes across different 3D scenes. In
contrast, we propose to learn scene-conditioned camera poses for object rendering.

Many works have studied how to model the object relations in complex 3D scenes [7, 16, 18–
20, 34, 49, 53]. For example, 3DVG-Trans [53] and M3DRef-CLIP [52] model the spatial relations
based on distances. ViL3DRef [9] and CORE-3DVG [41] incorporate language and hand-selected
features to guide the spatial relations. Differently, we propose a simple yet effective language-
informed balancing strategy to explicitly reason over the spatial relation that solely depends on
distances.

Approach

Given a 3D point cloud of a scene S, and a text description T , the task of multi-object 3D grounding
aims to predict the set of bounding boxes P for objects that are referred to in the text description.

Figure 1: Illustration of the overall pipeline. Our D-LISA processes the 3D point cloud through the
dynamic visual module (Sec. 3.1) and encodes the text description through a text encoder. The visual
and word features are fused through a language informed spatial fusion module (Sec. 3.2).

Attention (D-LISA) follows the detection-and-selection paradigm for multi-object 3D grounding
task [52]. This paradigm involves three components: (i) a text encoder to extract text features; (ii) a
vision module to detect object proposals and extract corresponding features given a point cloud; (iii)
a fusion module that combines the text and object features to select the final referred bounding-boxes.
Specifically, our D-LISA is designed with a novel vision module that allows for a dynamic number of
proposal boxes and extracts features from dynamic viewpoints (Sec. 3.1) per scene. Furthermore,
we propose a fusion model that is spatially aware with explicit language conditioning (Sec. 3.2). An
overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.

3.1
Dynamic Vision Module

Our dynamic vision module takes a 3D scene point cloud S as the input and generates a set of box
proposals B with corresponding visual features F. As in prior work [52], we adopt the backbone
detector of PointGroup [25] to obtain a fixed number of M box candidates C, i.e., |C| = M. To
eliminate irrelevant detected objects, we employ a dynamic box proposal module with non-maximum
suppression (NMS). This module dynamically selects a subset with variable sizes, from the M
candidates, to form the set of box proposals B, which are then used by the fusion model.

Dynamic box proposal. To achieve box proposals with a flexible number, we learn a dynamic
proposal probability αm for each of the M box candidates.

We model the proposal probability αm as a normalized linear function of the detector score sm, i.e.,

αm = Sigmoid(Linear(sm)).
(1)

At prediction time, an object candidate would be selected if the dynamic proposal probability exceeds
the filtering threshold τf:
B′ = {bm ∈C | αm > τf},
(2)

where bm denotes the 3D box of the mth object.

We then use non-maximum suppression (NMS) [14] to remove overlapping boxes from the box
proposal candidates B′ and finalize the box proposals B. First, the proposal probabilities αi are
sorted in descending order. Then we sequentially select the candidate with the highest probability
as a box proposal and remove other box proposal candidates that have an Intersection over Union
(IoU) greater than a threshold τNMS. The NMS module ensures the box proposals B do not include
duplicated boxes for the same object.

Dynamic Proposal loss. To train this proposal probability, we incorporated a regularization term
penalizing the expected value of the number of boxes

Ldyn =

αm.

This loss encourages the model to use as few box proposals as possible while maintaining the
grounding performance.

Object proposal feature extraction. Given the N box proposals B, i.e., |B| = N, we extract visual
features F that is a concatenation of both the 3D features F3D from the detector and 2D features F2D
from our dynamic multi-view renderer.

3D feature from detector backbone. Each box bn in the box proposals B has a corresponding 3D
feature f 3D
i
that can be extracted from the detector backbone. Next, to ensure that the proposal
probability αm reflect the quality of the box bm, we weight the 3D features with the probability, i.e.,

F3D = {α1 · f 3D
1 , α2 · f 3D
2 , . . . , αN · f 3D
N }.
(4)

2D feature from Dynamic multi-view renderer. The dynamic multi-view renderer takes as input the
box proposals B and generates the corresponding 2D features F2D. Instead of using fixed camera
poses for rendering all objects across different scenes, we learn scene-conditioned camera poses for
rendering. We predefined V base camera poses dcam
j
for j = 1, 2, . . . , V . Next, we calculate the
average size of all boxes denoted as ¯q ∈R3 with the average length, width, and height respectively.
We use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to learn the camera pose offset for each view j based on the
average box size ¯q:
∆pcam
j
= MLPj(¯q).
(5)

The final camera pose for each view j is

pcam
j
= dcam
j
+ ∆pcam
j
.
(6)

For each view j, the renderer generates the 2D image for each box proposal bi with camera pose
pcam
j
. The pre-trained CLIP image encoder extracts the 2D features for each view. Finally, we
compute the average over all the extracted features from each view to obtain the 2D features

3.2
Language-Informed Spatial Fusion Module

Given the visual features F from the dynamic vision module and the word features W from CLIP’s
text encoder, the language-informed spatial fusion module predicts a probability pn on whether the
object in box bn is targeted in the text description. The module consists of a stack of transformer
layers followed by an MLP grounding head.

To better capture the spatial relationship among objects, we introduce the language-informed spatial
attention (LISA) block that balances the visual attention weights and the spatial relations using the
sentence feature g, a weighted sum over all word features. Each transformer layer comprises a
language-informed spatial attention block and a cross-attention block, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Finally,
we only predicted a box if the associated probability pn exceeds a threshold τpred, i.e., the predicted
box set is
P = {bn | pn > τpred}.
(8)

We now discuss the details of LISA. The details of the cross-attention block are provided in Ap-
pendix Sec. A4.

Figure 2: Illustration of language informed spatial attention (LISA). We model the object relations
through spatial distance D. For each box proposal, a spatial score is predicted to balance the visual
attention weights and spatial relations.

LISA follows the standard self-attention mechanism proposed by Vaswani et al. [35] consisting of
queries, keys, and values. Given F , the queries Q, keys K and values V are computed as follows:

Q = F WQ,
K = F WK,
V = F WV
(9)

with linear projections WQ/V/K ∈Rdo×d.

To explicitly build in spatial reasoning, we introduce spatial scores B, conditioned on the sentence
feature and visual features, to weight between the standard attention terms and a spatial distance
matrix D. The overall language-informed spatial attention is as follows:

LISA(F , g, D) = softmax

(1N −B) ⊙QKT

√

d
+ B ⊙D

V ,
(10)

where 1N is an all-ones matrix and softmax normalizes along each row. We now describe B and D.

Spatial scores B. Given a variety of objects in a complex scene, we want the model to dynamically
learn whether an object should pay more attention to the spatial relationship based on text description.
For the ith object in the box proposal, we predict the normalized score βi by concatenating the visual
feature fi and the sentence feature g, followed by a linear projection. To align with the attention
weights, we construct the spatial scores B ∈RN×N as

B =



where βi = Sigmoid(Linear(g ⊕fi))
(11)

and ⊕denotes a concatenation.

Spatial distance matrix D. We model the spatial relationship among objects through relative distances.
We construct this matrix D ∈RN×N by computing the pairwise l2-distance between the box centers
ci and cj, i.e., dij = ||ci −cj||2. To ensure that closer objects should receive greater attention, we
define Dij =
1
dij .

Training details

In addition to the dynamic proposal loss for our dynamic box proposal module, we follow the loss
functions of the prior work [52] for end-to-end training. These include detection loss, reference loss,
and contrastive loss. We briefly discuss these losses for completeness.

Detection loss. We use Pointgroup [25] as our detector backbone and adopt their training losses.
The detection loss Ldet consists of four components: a) a semantic segmentation loss, b) an offset
regression loss, c) an offset direction loss, and d) a proposal score loss.

Reference loss. For multi-object 3D grounding, we adopt the binary cross-entropy loss over the
detected objects as the reference loss Lref. We apply the Hungarian algorithm [26] to find an optimal
match based on the pairwise IoU between the detected objects and ground truth. A detected box is
successfully grounded if it matches one ground truth box in the Hungarian solution and the pairwise
IoU is greater than a threshold τtrain. For single-object 3D grounding, we use the cross-entropy loss.
We identify the highest IoU between the detected boxes and the ground truth box and consider it a
success if this maximal IoU is greater than the threshold τtrain.

Contrastive loss. We apply a symmetric contrastive loss Lctr between the object features and the word
features. A positive pair is formed if the object features and the word features come from the same
scene-instruction pair, while a negative pair is formed if they come from different scene-instruction
pairs. For computing efficiency, we only identify the positive and negative pairs within a single batch.
This loss has been proven effective for learning better multi-modal embeddings [52].

The total loss function is a weighted sum over all loss terms

L = λdetLdet + λrefLref + λctrLctr + λdynLdyn,
(12)

where λi is the individual loss weight for each loss term Li.

Experiments

We conduct experiments on the Multi3DRefer [52] dataset. We also compare our model with other
two-stage methods on single-object grounding using the ScanRefer [8] and the Nr3D [2] datasets.
Finally, we ablate the effectiveness of each proposed module.

4.1
Multi-object 3D grounding

Dataset and evaluation metric. Multi3DRefer is a dataset based on ScanRefer [8]. It contains
61,926 descriptions of 11,609 objects, with each text description potentially referencing zero, single,
or multiple target objects.

Using the standard evaluation protocol [52], we report the F1 score at the intersection over union (IoU)
threshold of 0.5 over five different categories: a) zero target without distractors of the same semantic
class (ZT w/o D); b) zero target with distractors (ZT w/D); c) single target without distractors (ST
w/o D); d) single target with distractors (ST w/D); and e) multiple targets (MT). The average over
these categories is reported as an overall score.

Baselines. Following prior work [52], we consider two-stage methods that perform well on the
ScanRefer dataset as baselines; including, 3DVG-Trans [53], D3Net [9], 3DJCG [6] and M3DRef-
CLIP [52]. We also report the performance of M3DRef-CLIP with NMS after the first-stage detector
for a fair comparison.

Implementation details. We train our model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. We set the batch
size to 4 with the AdamW optimizer using a learning rate of 5e−4. We follow the same train/val set
split as the baselines [52]. For the PointGroup detector, we use the same pre-trained PointGroup

module following Zhang et al. [52] with the same loss coefficients. We set the dynamic proposal loss
coefficient αdyn to 5. We set the τtrain to 0.25 and search for the optimal value of τpred over {0.05, 0.1,
0.15, 0.2, 0.25} during evaluation for M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS and our model.

Results. We compare the F1@0.5 metric of our model and state-of-the-art baselines on Multi3DRefer
val set in Tab. 1. Our D-LISA achieves a 12.8% absolute increase in the overall F1@0.5 score over
M3DRef-CLIP. Comparing M3DRef-CLIP and M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS, we observe that NMS is
a key factor in the final F1 score, successfully removing duplicate predictions leading to improved
recall.

Next, D-LISA achieves a better overall F1 score, especially for multiple targets and sub-categories
where the distractors of the same semantic class exist. We further provide qualitative results over our
method and the baselines in Fig. 3. The top two rows are examples from multiple target categories.
Our D-LISA successfully identifies more objects that match the text description. The last row shows
an example of a single target with distractors. Our D-LISA accurately identifies the object while the
baselines are affected by the distractors and predict additional incorrect targets.

4.2
Single-object 3D grounding.

Dataset and evaluation metric. We evaluate the single-object 3D grounding performance on the
ScanRefer and the Nr3D datasets. The ScanRefer dataset contains 51,583 human-written sentences
for 800 scenes in ScanNet [13]. ScanRefer divides scenes into “Unique” and “Multiple” subsets
based on whether the semantic class of the target object is unique in the scene.

The Nr3D dataset consists of 41,503 human-annotated text descriptions across 707 indoor scenes
from ScanNet. Nr3D divides scenes into “Easy” and “Hard” subsets based on whether there exist the
distractors of the same semantic class, and into “View-dependent” and “View-independent” subsets
based on whether a specific viewpoint is required to identify the target. Both ScanRefer and Nr3D
are annotated for single-object grounding. Different from ScanRefer, Nr3D assumes perfect object
proposals are provided.

Following prior work [52], for the ScanRefer dataset we report Acc@0.5 on both val and test sets
over different subsets. The number represents the proportion of predicted target boxes that have an
IoU value greater than 0.5 compared to the ground truth box. For the Nr3D dataset, we report the
accuracy of selecting the target bounding box among all candidate proposals on the test set over
different subsets.

Baselines. We focus on comparing the two-stage methods designed for the situation where the ground
truth box proposals are not provided. For the ScanRefer dataset, we compare with the baselines:
TGNN [20], FFL-3DOG [16], InstanceRefer [49], 3DVG-Trans [53], 3DJCG [6], D3Net [9], UniT3D
[12], HAM [10], CORE-3DVG [41] and M3DRef-CLIP [52]. For joint captioning and grounding
models 3DJCG, D3Net, and UniT3D, we compare their best grounding performance with extra
captioning training data. For the Nr3D dataset, we compare with the above baselines which reported
the performance in their paper.

Implementation details. We follow the multi-object setting to adapt to the single-object setting.
Differently, we let the fusion module return the most likely box among all the proposal boxes instead
of using a threshold. For the Nr3D dataset, we follow the prior work [52] to directly crop the box
features from the detector backbone based on the ground truth bounding boxes. We follow the same
train/val/test set split for both datasets as the baselines.

Results. We report the Acc@0.5 of different methods on the ScanRefer val set and test set in Tab. 2.
Comparing M3DRef-CLIP and M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS, we could see that non-maximum suppression
slightly improves the performance. Our D-LISA outperforms all existing baselines on both the
ScanRefer val set and test set, especially for the subsets where there are multiple objects with the
semantic class of the target object in the scene.

Next, we report the grounding accuracy of different methods on the Nr3D test set in Tab. 3. Our
D-LISA outperforms all baselines on the Nr3D test set over all subsets. For more comparison with
other methods on the ScanRefer and the Nr3D datasets, see Sec. A2 in the Appendix.

Limitations: As with other two-stage methods, the grounding performance of our designed two-stage
model is upper bounded by the detector quality. From Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, we can see that our model
achieves better performance for complex scenarios but sacrifice some performance for the simpler
single-object settings.

Ablation studies

We conduct ablation studies on the proposed modules to validate their effectiveness under the multi-
object grounding setting on the M3DRef dataset. The ablations follow the same experiment settings
for the multi-object grounding in Sec. 4.1. The baseline Row #1 shows the result of M3DRef-CLIP
w/NMS.

Dynamic box proposal. In Tab. 4, comparing Row #3 with baseline Row #1, we validate the
effectiveness of the dynamic box proposal module. We also validate the number of box candidates in
the reasoning stage after using the dynamic box proposal module. For our complete model Row #5,
an average of 30.5 boxes are selected for the fusion stage on the M3DRefer val set. This is a much
smaller number of boxes compared to the 62.4 boxes used in baseline Row #1.

Dynamic multi-view renderer. In Tab. 4, comparing Row #2 with baseline Row #1, we validate the
effectiveness of the dynamic multi-view renderer module. We provide the qualitative results for the
dynamic multi-view renderer in Fig. 4. Instead of using fixed camera poses, the dynamic renderer
adapts different camera poses from scene to scene, enhancing the quality of 2D object features.

Language informed spatial fusion. In Tab. 4, comparing Row #4 with baseline Row #1, we validate
the effectiveness of the language-informed spatial fusion module, especially for the sub-categories
where distractors exist (ZT w/D and ST w/D). For more ablation results on the language-informed
spatial fusion module, please refer to Appendix Sec. A3.

Computational cost. We report the FLOPs and inference time of each proposed module and a
comparison with the baseline model M3DRef-CLIP in Tab. 5. All experiments are conducted on
Multi3DRefer validation set on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The reported FLOPs and inference
time are the average over the validation set. We observe that the dynamic box proposal module

increasing computations.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present D-LISA, a two-stage pipeline for multi-object 3D grounding, featuring three
novel components. Our dynamic box proposal module dynamically selects the key box proposals
from detected objects. We enhance the 2D features through optimized scene-conditioned rendering
poses using a dynamic multi-view renderer. Furthermore, our language-informed spatial fusion
module facilitates explicit reasoning over the object spatial relations. Our proposed approach not
only outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multi-object 3D grounding but also is competitive in
single-object 3D grounding.

The appendix is organized as follows:

• In Sec. A1, we provide additional results on the Multi3DRefer dataset for multi-object grounding.
• In Sec. A2, we provide additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on ScanRefer and
Nr3D datasets for single-object grounding.

Additional multi-object grounding results

F1@0.25 evaluation on Multi3DRefer validation set. We provide additional comparisons with
M3DRef-CLIP over F1@0.25 in Tab. A1. We observe that our D-LISA achieves a better overall
F1@0.25 score, especially for multiple targets and sub-categories where the distractors of the same
semantic class exist. This aligns with our observation for F1@0.5 results in Tab. 4.

Additional ablation results on question types. Additional ablations for different query types,
including queries with spatial, color, texture, and shape information are reported in Tab. A2. We
observe that each proposed module effectively improves the performance for the queries that contain
spatial, color, and shape information, and is competitive with the baseline for queries with texture
information. The overall model achieves better grounding performance across all query types than
the baseline.

designed D-LISA outperforms the baseline M3DRef-CLIP both with and without the NMS module.
Using the NMS module would lead to a higher F1 score compared to not using it.

A2
Additional single-object grounding comparisons

We provide additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets for
single-object grounding. These methods do not follow the detection-and-selection two-stage diagram.
Different from ScanRefer, Nr3D assumes perfect object proposals are provided. We focus on the
grounding performance on the ScanRefer dataset as the task setting is more realistic. We report the
grounding performance on both ScanRefer and Nr3D for completeness.

ScanRefer dataset. We provide additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on the
ScanRefer dataset in Tab. A5. For the methods using object proposals as input instead of the 3D
scene, typically a separate pre-trained detector is used to pre-process the scene [11, 21, 39, 46, 54].
Our D-LISA outperforms all existing methods and achieves the best grounding accuracy on both the
validation set and test set, which further validates the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Nr3D dataset. We provide additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on the Nr3D
dataset in Tab. A6. Our D-LISA still achieves comparable results.

A3
Additional results for LISA

We provide more experimental results on our designed language informed spatial attention (LISA)
module. We show the ablation results on the design choice and compare our module with other
language-guided attention modules.

Design choice. We analyze the factors that affect the spatial score β and report the F1@0.5 metric
on Multi3DRefer dataset in Tab. A7. The result shows using both the sentence feature and object
feature to predict the spatial score β yields the best grounding performance.

Additional comparison.
We compare our designed LISA with the spatial self-attention in
ViL3DRef [11], which also models the object relations guided by language. ViL3DRef pre-defines
object relations through hand-crafted features. These hand-selected features work with ground truth
object proposals but lead to worse performance when the object proposals are predicted, i.e. noisy.
As is shown in Tab. A5 and Tab. A6, though ViL3DRel works well on the Nr3D benchmark
which provides ground truth box proposals, the performance is much worse when validating on the
ScanRefer benchmark where no ground truth proposals are provided.

Additional details for D-LISA

We provide additional architecture details for our D-LISA and additional implementation details for
the experiment setup.

Cross-attention. In the language informed fusion module, a language informed spatial attention block
is followed by a cross-attention block (Sec. 3.2). The cross-attention block takes the spatially enhanced
visual features F s from LISA and word features after a self-attention block as input and generates
language-informed visual features F c. We follow the standard cross-attention mechanism as described
in Vaswani et al. [35]. We formulate the word feature matrix input as FT = [t1, t2, . . . , tL]T ∈Rd×d,
where tj ∈Rd is the corresponding feature for wj ∈W after self-attention. Given F s and FT ,
queries Qc, keys Kc and values Vc correspond to:

Qc = F sW c
Q,
Kc = FT W c
K,
Vc = FT W c
V
(A13)

with linear projections W c
Q/V/K ∈Rd×d. The overall cross-attention is formulated as:

F c = Cross-Attention(F s, FT ) = softmax(QcKT
c
√

d
)Vc,
(A14)

where softmax is the softmax normalization along rows.

Additional implementation details. Following the prior work [52], we take point coordinates, point
normals, and per-point multi-view features S ∈RH×(3+3+128) as scene input, where H denotes the
total number of points in the scene. For NMS process, we set the threshold τNMS to be 0.4. For CLIP,
we use a frozen pre-trained CLIP with ViT-B/32. For loss coefficient terms in Eq. (12), we set λdet,
λref and λctr to 1 and λdyn to 5. We initialize the camera baseline poses following the fixed camera
poses in prior work [52], where for each view the rendering camera is set to be 1 meter away from the
object, with an elevation angle of 45◦. For the fusion module, we follow the same settings in terms of
dimension size, layer number, and head size as used for the baseline [52].

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see Sec. 3 and Sec. 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Please see Sec. 4.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

19


---Page Break---
Justification: The paper does not include theoretical result.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Please see Sec. 4 and Sec. A4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

20


---Page Break---
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code is available at https://github.com/haomengz/D-LISA.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Sec. 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The evaluation setting for the experiments in this paper does not involve
reporting error bars, confidence intervals or other statistical significance tests.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

21


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report the training resource in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.3.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: No violation of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [No]

Justification: The scope of this work is an recognition task in computer vision. There are no
obvious and direct societal impacts.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

22


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Sec. 4 and Sec. A4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

23


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We open-source the code and model at https://github.com/haomengz/
D-LISA.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA] .
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
