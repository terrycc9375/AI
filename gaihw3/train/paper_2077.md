Abstract

Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelli-
gence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assum-
ing a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban
systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions,
current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and
adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various
dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential
to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST)
to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal
learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task
learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotempo-
ral interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and
main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects
to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and
personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation
training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness
by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses cor-
related patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further
establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and
empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on
these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and
new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available

Introduction

Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable smart and convenient urban lives,
benefiting diverse urban applications from intra-city travelling, environment controlling to location-
based POI recommendation, and injecting the vitality into urban economics. Existing spatiotemporal
learning solutions [19, 9, 38, 40, 51, 42, 37, 10, 8] focus on improving performances of a task-specific
model independently where these methods devise various spatial learning blocks [44, 8, 43] and
temporal dependency extraction modules [40, 34, 9] to model the spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

Actually, urban spatiotemporal systems are usually highly dynamic with emerging new data modality,
leading to serious generalization issue on both data pattern and task adaptation. As illustrated in

Figure 1, the traffic volume patterns can evolve with urban expansion and establishment of new
POIs. Concurrently, with increasing attention on road safety, traffic accident prediction has become a
new task in intelligent transportation that inevitably suffers from the cold-start issue. Unfortunately,
traditional task-specific models usually assume that data on a single task follows independent and
identical distribution and are intensively available where such assumption directly leads to failures
on data sparsity scenarios and generalization to new tasks. In fact, given diverse datasets, separately
training single task-specific spatiotemporal models is cost sensitive and will trap the models into
isolation. To this end, we argue that a continuous multi-task spatiotemporal learning framework
is highly desirable to facilitate the task-level cooperation. It is even more interesting and exciting
to jointly model multi-domain datasets with multi-task learning, which empowers understanding
spatiotemporal system in a holistic perspective and reinforce each individual task by exploiting the
collective intelligence from diverse data domains.

The key towards exploiting task-wise correlations for mutual improvement is to capture
the common interdependencies across data dimensions and domains.
Current multi-task
learning schemes either investigate the regularization effects between auxiliary and main
tasks [31, 17], or devise loss objectives to constrain the consistency between each task [7, 32].

Figure 1: Illustration of evolution on data patterns
and learning tasks.

Actually, given a spatiotemporal domain, there
must be common interdependencies across dif-
ferent data types and domains, which are valu-
able for cooperated learning. Even prosperity
of multi-task learning and spatiotemporal fore-
casting, there are never a systematic solution on
how various sourced data from different tasks
reinforce a specific task with multi-task learning.
More specifically, interrelations among obser-
vations in a system can be decomposed into multi-dimensional interactions, i.e., from contextual
environment to respective spatial relations and temporal evolutions, spatial-temporal level interactions
and relations across different data domains. Considering the multi-level semantic correlations, learn-
ing the system in a holistic perspective is required and further pose two challenges to a continuous
multi-task spatiotemporal learning framework, i.e., 1) How to disentangle complex associations
between data dimensions and domains, and capture such dependencies in an adaptive manner to
improve spatiotemporal representation, hence facilitating the extraction of common patterns for
mutual enhancement. 2) How to exploit task-level commonality and personality to jointly model
the multi-task datasets, and exploit such extracted task-level commonality and diversity to reinforce
respective task for getting rid of task isolation.

In our work, a Continuous Multi-task SpatioTemporal learning framework, CMuST, is proposed
to jointly model multiple datasets in an integrated urban system thus reinforcing respective learn-
ing tasks. Specifically, a Multi-dimensional Spatio-Temporal Interaction Network (MSTI) is first
devised to dissect interactions across data dimensions, including context-spatial, context-temporal
and self-interaction within spatial and temporal dimensions. MSTI enables improved spatiotemporal
representation with interactions, and also provides disentangled patterns to support commonality
extraction. After that, a Rolling Adaptation training scheme, RoAda, which iteratively captures the
task-wise consistency and task-specific diversity, is proposed. In RoAda, to maintain task characteri-
zation, a task-specific prompt is constructed to preserve unique patterns distinguishing from other
tasks by compressing data patterns via an AutoEncoder. To capture the commonality across tasks,
we propose a weight behavior modeling strategy to iteratively highlight the minimized variations
of learnable weights, i.e., stable interactions during continuous training, which encapsulates crucial
task-level commonalities. This approach not only stabilizes learning through continuous task rolling,
but alleviates the cold-start over new tasks with shared patterns. Finally, a task-specific refinement is
devised to leverage commonality and fine-grained adaptation on specific tasks.

The contributions of this work can be three-fold. 1) The first continuous multi-task spatiotemporal
learning framework, CMuST to jointly model learning tasks in a same spatiotemporal domain,
which not only reinforces individual correlated learning task in collective perspective, but also help
understand the cooperative mechanism of dynamic spatiotemporal systems. 2) Technically, two
learning modules, MSTI and RoAda are proposed to dissect the impacts and interactions over multi-
dimensions, and iteratively update the task-wise commonality and generate individual personalization
to continuous task adaptation in multi-task learning. 3) We construct benchmark datasets in each of

three cities, where two of them consists of at least 3 types of observations within same spatiotemporal
domain. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority on enhancement of each individual
task with limited data and the interpretation of task-wise continuous learning.

Related Work

Spatiotemporal forecasting is an emerging technique to capture the dynamic spatial and temporal
evolution for diverse urban predictions, where the methods can be divided into machine learning-
based and deep learning-based. Conventional solutions rely on complex mathematical tools to
simulate the dynamics including ARIMA [25], SVR [3] and matrix-factorization learning [28] for
capturing spatial correlations. With deep learning solutions flourishing, Convolution Neural Networks
(CNNs) [40, 11, 46] are exploited to imitate the temporal dependencies and GNNs [43, 13, 36]
are utilized to imitate spatial propagation. Meanwhile, by taking the advantage of the flexibility
and interpretability of attention, Spatial-Temporal Attention [9], and Vision Transformer (ViT) [6]
are introduced to improve spatiotemporal representation. Also there are also many methods for
temporal periodicity capturing [12, 20]. More specifically, DG2RNN [49] designs a dual-graph
convolutional module to capture local spatial dependencies from both road distance and adaptive
correlation perspectives. PDFormer [15] designs a spatial self-attention and introduces two graph
masking matrices to highlight the spatial dependencies of short- and long-range views. TESTAM [18]
uses time-enhanced ST attention by mixture-of-experts and modeling both static and dynamic graphs.
Even so, most solutions focus on single-task intelligence, fail to deal with complex interactions
between data dimensions and never extract task-level commonality patterns, resulting in inferior
performances on exploiting collective intelligence over multiple tasks. In contrast, we merge the gap
by disentangling learnable interaction patterns and exploring rolling task adaptations.

Multi-task learning. Plenty of efforts have been made on multi-task learning (MTL) and MTL
can be elaborated by two-fold, i.e., feature-based and parameter-based. Feature-based MTL [2, 24]
learns a common feature representation for different tasks, but it may be easily affected by outlier
tasks. To this end, parameter-based MTL [30, 16] is devised to exploit model parameters to relate
different tasks, which is expected to learn robust parameters. Majority of these MTL schemes either
concentrate on the diversity design and regularization effects of auxiliary tasks to main task [30, 27],
or construct loss functions to ensure task-wise consistency [47]. A pioneering work investigates a
gradient-driven task grouping to realize multi-task learning [41] where the focuses are text and images
using pre-trained CLIP model. For spatiotemporal learning, RiskOracle [52] and RiskSeq [53] are
proposed to simultaneously predict multi-grained risks and auxiliary traffic elements. More recently,
UniST [45] and UniTime [22] construct a unified model for spatiotemporal and time-series prediction.
However, all researches on ST learning still never dissect task-wise correlations, especially capture
explicit consistency and diversity among tasks and investigate how each task reinforce the core task,
which is of great significance for performance and interpretability in MTL.

Continuous learning and task continuous learning. Continuous learning (CL) usually keeps
long-term and important information while updates model memories with newly arrived instances [29,
5, 35]. For spatiotemporal forecasting, Chen, et, al. [5] proposes a historical-data replay strategy,
TrafficStream, to update the neural network with all nodes feeding, while PECPM [35] manages
a pattern bank with conflict nodes, which reduces the memory storage burdens. Most existing CL
solutions are designed for homogeneous sourced data. Then there are very few research investigating
task-level continuous learning where task can be converted from one to another. A pioneering
work, CLS-ER [1] realizes class-level and domain-level continuous learning with a dual memory to
respectively store instances and build long-short term memories. Even so, the data input to CLS-ER
is with same image-like property and scales, which is still far away from task diversity. We argue
that learning continuously on task levels can increase the data tolerance over low-quality data and
also generalization capacity on new tasks. In this work, by taking bonus of continuous learning,
we propose to iteratively assimilate the commonality and extract personalization to reinforce each
learning task and realize continuous multi-task spatiotemporal intelligence.

Spatiotemporal features refer to the data points collected by
sensors deployed in urban environments, such as traffic dynamics on roads. We define a spatiotemporal

feature at a specific time and location as a vector X ∈RC, where C represents the number of attributes
(e.g., vehicle flow, speed) recorded by the sensor. We generalize this to define spatiotemporal data
collected over a period as X ∈RT ×N×C, where T denotes the number of discrete time intervals,
and N denotes the number of spatial nodes corresponding to sensor locations.

Definition 2 (Spatiotemporal prediction.)
Spatiotemporal prediction involves forecasting future
values of spatiotemporal data based on historical observations. Specifically, given a historical
dataset X = [Xt−T , . . . , Xt−1, Xt] ∈RT ×N×C, the objective is to predict future observations
ˆY = [Xt+1, . . . , Xt+T ′] ∈RT ′×N×C. Here, T ′ represents the prediction horizon, the number of
future time steps we seek to forecast, which for simplicity is set equal to T in this paper.

Definition 3 (Multi-task spatiotemporal learning.)
Given a set of spatiotemporal tasks in an
integrated urban system T = {T1, T2, . . . , Tk} where each task Ti is associated with a dataset Di =
{Xi, Yi}. Here, Xi ∈RTi×Ni×Ci represents the input features collected over Ti time steps, across
Ni spatial locations, and Ci feature dimensions, and Yi ∈RT ′
i ×Ni×Ci represents the corresponding
targets. Multi-task spatiotemporal learning aims to learn a function f : X0, X1, . . . , Xk−1 →
ˆY0, ˆY1, . . . , ˆYk−1 that optimally predicts all target Yi from their respective inputs Xi, leveraging
shared and unique patterns across tasks to improve generalization performance.

Methodology

Framework Overview

The CMuST is crafted to advance urban intelligence through a synergistic integration of three
components in Figure 2. We processes and standardizes diverse urban data into a harmonized format,
and propose the MSTI to intricately dissect the complex interactions within spatiotemporal data, and
devise a RoAda to dynamically fine-tune the model via continuous and careful updating, ensuring
robust adaptability and consistent performance across fluctuating urban environments.

4.2
Data Representation and Integration

To harness various data domains within urban spatiotemporal systems as well as data interactions
between diverse dimensions, the first task is to appropriately process main ST observations, spatial
indicator, and temporal indicator to create a comprehensive and integrated data representation tailored
for multi-task ST learning, enabling further interactive modeling between them.

To be specific, the main observation data, namely target of interest of urban datasets, are denoted
as Xobs ∈RT ×N×C, and then mapped into a spatiotemporal representation Eobs ∈RT ×N×dobs
via an MLP ObsMLP(Xobs; θobs). Similarly, the spatial indicator Xs ∈RT ×N×2, consisting of
longitude and latitude coordinates, is applied with a linear layer SpatialMLP(Xs; θs) to produce
the spatial representation Es ∈RT ×N×ds. Temporal indicator comprises day-of-week, time-of-day
Xdow, Xtod ∈RT ×N and timestamps Xts ∈RT ×N×6, which are further compressed into hidden

representation, i.e., Et = TemporalMLP(Ets∥Edow∥Etod; θt) ∈RT ×N×dt , enabling the model to
capture the periodicity and sequential features of temporal data. Pτ is a task-specific prompt 2 to
ensure task-awareness, and is integrated into the final embedding. Given the task Tk,

H(Tk) = Eobs∥Es∥Et∥P(Tk)
(1)

where ∥denotes vector concatenation, combining spatial, temporal, and observational embeddings
with the task prompt into a comprehensive representation H(Tk) ∈RT ×N×dh. We will use H as
representation for a specific task in following sections.

4.3
Multi-dimensional Spatio-Temporal Interaction

Spatiotemporal observations are usually complex with multiple-level interactions where such interac-
tions and correlations play vital roles in enhancing commonality learning through different learning
domains. To this end, we devise an MSTI, to intricately dissect and disentangle interactions within
spatiotemporal data from spatial-temporal indicators to main observations by inheriting nice property
of attention mechanisms, which all utilize transformed slices from the integrated representation H.

Spatial-context cross-interaction. To quantitatively investigate how spatial indicator interact with
main observations, we devise a multi-head cross-attention [14] architecture (MHCA) where spatial
and observational components are alternately used as queries (Q) and key-value (KV) pairs:

MHCA(a,b)(X) =


head

h=1
CrossAttention(a,b)(h)WO
(2)

CrossAttention(a,b)(h) = Attention

Q(a)
h , K(b)
h , V(b)
h

(3)

Attention (Qh, Kh, Vh) = softmax
QhK⊤
h
√

D


Vh
(4)

The symbol ∥denotes the concatenation of multiple attention heads, and WO is the projection matrix
that aligns the output dimensions with those of H. Here, we let variables a and b indicate spatial (s)
indicator and main observation (o), i.e., a = s and b = o. Then the queries, keys, and values are
generated through following transformations,

Q(s)
h
= H[. . . , slice(s)]W(Qs)
h
,
K(o)
h
= H[. . . , slice(o)]W(Ko)
h
,
V(o)
h
= H[. . . , slice(o)]W(Vo)
h(5)
where W transforms input data into dimension D of attention space, slice(s) and slice(o) denote the
respective slices of H for spatial and observational features. After computing attention scores, the
embeddings are taken into a feed-forward network (FFN) to enhance the learning capabilities, where
FFN(X) = max(0, XW1 + b1)W2 + b2. The final attention outputs are then normalized by,

˜H(a,b)[. . . , slice(b)] = LN(FFN(LN(MHCA(a,b)(H) + H[. . . , slice(b)]))

+ LN(MHCA(a,b)(H) + H[. . . , slice(b)])),
(6)

where LN is layer normalization, the resulting matrices ˜H(s,o) and ˜H(o,s) are then concatenated back
to H at their respective dimensions as ˜H(SCCI) ∈RT ×N×dh, enriching the original representation
with refined features that encapsulate intricate cross-dimensional relationships.

Temporal-context cross-interaction. To facilitate the attention computation with respect to temporal
dimension, the representation is first transposed as ˜H′(SCCI) ∈RN×T ×dh by denoting T as the
sequence length for subsequent attention calculations. Then the step-wise positional encoding (refer
to Appendix B.2) is introduced to allow our attention aware of specific temporal evolution.

The subsequent steps closely follow those of the spatial-context cross-attention mechanism, so the
temporal-context cross-interaction (TCCI) can be performed as ˜H(CI) = TCCI( ˜H′(SCCI)), and final
representation ˜H(CI) ∈RN×T ×dh becomes the outcome of cross interactions between spatial and
temporal dimensions.

Self-interactions within Spatial and Temporal Aspects. We proceed to apply self-interaction across
different dimensions of the representations using self-attentions [21]. Specifically, we begin with

2We introduce a task summarization as the prompt (refer Section 4.4) to generate the distinct prompts.

5


---Page Break---
temporal dimension, as the sequence length of representation dimension has naturally been aligned
as T. This setup allows direct computation of the required self-attention,

MHA(X) =


head

h=1
Attention (Qh, Kh, Vh) WO
(7)

In this multi-head attention (MHA) configuration, the attention calculation (referred to in Equation 4,
5) involves queries, keys, and values, which is derived from the entire representation ˜H(CI), rather
than individual slices. Then the output undergoes further processing through a FFN and non-linear
transformations and LN to stabilize and enrich the feature representations similar Equation 6. The
resulting ˜H(T SI) in RN×T ×dh signifies the outcome of temporal self-interactions (TSI). Then the
tensor is transposed to ˜H′(T SI) ∈RT ×N×dh. The final spatial self-interaction (SSI) computation is
analogous to the temporal version, which refines spatial interactions and aggregates features across
spatial nodes, as ˜H = SSI( ˜H′(T SI)). The resulting tensor from this computation is ˜H ∈RT ×N×dh,
which represents the outcome of comprehensive multi-dimensional interactions.

We then adaptively integrate the interactions by a fusion strategy and Huber loss is adopted to ensure
the robustness to outliers in spatiotemporal samples. Details can be found in Appendix B.3. Our
MSTI allows extracting diverse interactions, including spatial-temporal domain interactions via
designing cross attentions on respective indicators, and self interactions within respective dimensions,
enhancing the data relation learning and supporting commonality extraction across task domains.

4.4
Rolling Adaptation over Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning

To ensure continuous task learning, we propose a Rolling adaptation scheme, RoAda, to model the
distinction and commonality among task domains. Our RoAda is composed of two stages with a
warm-up for commonality extraction and a task-specific refinement. Before the task rolling, we
construct prompts to distinguish personalization of each task. Thus, the commonality and diversity
can be leveraged to boost individual task adaptation.

Task summarization as prompts. To capture the task distinction, we devise a task summarization
by a Sampling-AutoEncoding scheme from each task. Consider task Tk, main observation becomes
X(Tk) ∈RT
(Tk)
all
×N×C. Such data is sampled by averaging observations over equivalent times of
day, yielding a periodic sample representation X(Tk)
samp ∈RL
(Tk)
t
×N×C, where L(Tk)
t
denotes the
number of time slots for task k within a day. Since neural networks tend to fit any data regularity, the
sampled features are fed into an autoencoder for extracting the compressed and distinguished data
patterns. Given the encoding and decoding processes, i.e., ϕ : Xsamp →S and ψ : S →X ′
samp, S
encapsulates the summarized core characteristics of the task. The decoding phase maps S back to a
reconstructed X′
samp, by minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error,

ϕ : S = sigmoid(WsXsamp + bs),
ϕ, ψ = arg min
ϕ,ψ
∥Xsamp −(ψ ◦ϕ)Xsamp∥2
(8)

where Ws is the weight, and bs is the bias. Following the encoder, the summary features S(Tk) are
transformed into the k-th task prompt P(Tk) = FCp(S(Tk); θp) with dimension alignment.

Weight behavior modeling. The first warm-up stage is designed via weight behavior modeling,
which assimilates the regularity from task to task. This process not only adapts the model to new
tasks but also solidifies its ability in generalizing across scenarios by capturing task-wise common
relations with modeling of model weight behaviors.

We begin with the task T1 via independently training the model until its performance stabilizes. By
denoting M as the model learned by MSTI, the training phase can be formally described as,

P(T1)
prompt
−−−→
load
M,
Train(M(D(T1)
train; Winit))
until
−−−−−−→
convergence W(T1)
c
(9)

where Winit are the initialized weights, D(T1)
train is the training dataset of task T1, and W(T1)
c
are the
weights when model converges. After that, our model transitions learning task from T1 to T2 by
loading the corresponding task prompt P(T2) and dataset D(T2)
train . This transition involves a critical
step where the evolution behavior of model weights W are carefully stored,

Train(M(D(T2)
train; W(T1)
c
))
for
−−−−−→
each epoch W(T2)
0
, W(T2)
1
, . . . , W(T2)
c
(10)

6


---Page Break---
To capture common patterns, we reflect the task-level stability and variations by the evolution
behavior of weights in M, i.e., W(T2) = {W(T1)
c
, W(T2)
0
, W(T2)
1
, . . . , W(T2)
c
}. The weight set
W(T2) is deliberately incorporated with finalized weight of task T1 and evolution of T2, which
explicitly captures the weight transition between tasks. We then introduce a collective variance σ to
capture such stability, and employ a threshold δ to disentangle the stable and dynamic weights along
the learning process, i.e.,

W(T2)
stable, W(T2)
dynamic = {wij ∈W(T2) : Var(wij) < δ}, {wij ∈W(T2) : Var(wij) ≥δ}
(11)

where Var(wij) represents the element-wise variance of the across different training iterations from
W(T1)
c
to W(T2)
c
, indicating the fluctuation degree of the weight values. A lower variance indicates
higher stability, suggesting minimal change in weights across updates. After that, stable weights
W(T2)
stable are then frozen, and the model transitions to the next task, T3, using the stabilized weights as
the initialization for further training,

Train(M(D(T3)
train; W(T2)
c
.frozen(W(T2)
stable)))
for
−−−−−→
each epoch W(T3)
0
, W(T3)
1
, . . . , W(T3)
c
(12)

Similar to Equation 12, this process is repeated until the completion of task Tk, resulting in the collec-
tion W(Tk) = {W(Tk−1)
c
, W(Tk)
0
, W(Tk)
1
, . . . , W(Tk)
c
}. The Equation 11 is similarly implemented
to derive W(Tk) = W(Tk)
stable ∥W(Tk)
dynamic. Since T1 is not involved with the commonality extraction,

we subsequently load T1 with W(Tk).frozen(W(Tk)
stable) to achieve the complete rolling process. The
stabilized weights across continuous tasks W′(T1) = W′(T1)
stable ∥W′(T1)
dynamic, serves as W∗can ulti-
mately result in a robust multi-task learning parameters encapsulated with well-extracted common
patterns via iterative stable weight selection, and it can also be served a collective intelligence by
exploiting multiple tasks, thus enhancing the generalization for subsequent learning.

Task-specific refinement phase. This phase aims to merge the gap between task-level commonality
and specificity, where the process continuously train the model from the prior phase to the next one,
as W∗
stable is frozen to maintain overall model stability and remaining weights are iteratively update
with task-specific prompts. This process allows CMuST to insert the individual intelligence into
integrated model and adjust itself to better suit the unique pattern of each task, i.e.,

M(Ti) = FineTuning(M, W∗, P (Ti))
(13)

where M(Ti) is tuned to maximize performance on the task at hand, which represents the task-specific
submodel after refinement. The FineTuning denotes adjustment process of model parameters.

Summary. Our RoAda not only ensures the preservation of commonalities across tasks, but each
model is also optimally tuned for its respective task with compressed task-level patterns, providing
CMuST with opportunity to achieve peak performance with both collective and individual intelligence.
More details of our methodology can be found in Appendix.

as well as attention-based models of (GMAN [50], ASTGCN [9], STTN [42]). The performance
metrics are mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), where lower
values indicate higher predictive performance.

Implementation details. We partitioned datasets into training, validation, and testing sets with
7:1:2 ratio. CMuST forecasts observations of next 12 time steps based on previous 12 steps, as
T = T ′ = 12, . All data were normalized to zero mean and unit variance, and predictions were
denormalized to normal values for evaluation. For the MSTI, embedding dimensions were dobs =
24, ds = 12, dt = 60, and the prompt dimension was 72. Dimensions for self-attention and cross-
attention respectively were 168 and 24, with each attention having 4 heads and FFN’s hidden
dimension was 256. The Adam optimizer is adopted with an initialized learning rate of 1 × 10−3, and
weight decay of 3 × 10−4, where the early-stop was applied. For RoAda, the threshold δ = 10−6.
Our model was implemented with PyTorch on a Linux system equipped with Tesla V100 16GB.

Performance Comparison

1) Performance comparison among baselines. In Table 1, we compared the predictive perfor-
mance of our CMuST with other methods across various city datasets. Obviously, our CMuST
significantly outperforms other baselines on all datasets across most of metrics and the multitask-
based methods improve performance by an average of 8.51% over the singletask-based methods.

This result underscores the effective-
ness of the cross-attention mechanism
for decoupling multidimensional de-
pendencies, which not only enhances
spatiotemporal representational capac-
ity, but also enables easy extraction of
common correlations among tasks and
thus empowering each individual task
to benefit from well-extracted common patterns. 2) Robustness in data-scarce scenarios within
multi-task framework. We constructed scenarios of data scarcity for specific tasks, i.e., we reduce
part of the spatial nodes in prediction of Crowd In, and also reduce number of samples in tempo-
ral dimension by expanding time intervals on NYC, to study the robustness of CMuST under the
challenging scenario of limited (reduced) data. Results shown in Table 2 indicate that assimilating
common information from other tasks can help better prediction in a single task even though it is with
limited data on either spatial and temporal dimension. This demonstrates that multi-task prediction
relax the requirement of individual tasks on both data volumes and distributions, where the shared
commonality effectively captures and delivers the consistency and diversity among tasks.

Ablation Study

To assess the effectiveness of each module in CMuST and its capability for multi-task learning,
we designed a set of variants as 1) w/o context-data interaction: remove the spatial-context and
temporal-context cross-interactions in the MSTI module, 2) w/o consistency maintainer: omit
the separation and freezing of stable weights during the RoAda phase, instead using all weights
for rolling training, 3) w/o task-specific preserver: eliminate the task-specific prompts, thus re-
moving the task-specific diversity preservation. Figure 3 supports our hypothesis that CMuST
is a cohesive and integral system, where the results of "w/o context-data interaction" deteriorate,

Figure 3: Ablation studies of CMuST on Chicago.

potentially indicating multidimensional interac-
tions from context environments to spatial rela-
tions and temporal evolution exactly make sense
for prediction. The results on "w/o consistency
maintainer" highlights the validity of capturing
task consistency and commonality to facilitate
task learning. Lastly, performances of "w/o task-
specific preserver" show that removing unique
patterns distinctive from other tasks makes infe-
rior results.

5.4
Case Study

1) Visualizing attention across training phases. In Figure 4(a), we visualize the changes of attention
weights of CMuST during the stage of RoAda. It is observed that as tasks are learning continuously,
the relationships and interactions across various dimensions is becoming distinctive and going stable,
demonstrating the consolidation process of dimension-level relations. By modeling weight behavior,
such consolidated relations and interactions between context and observations can further enable
the extraction of consistency in spatiotemporal interactions across tasks. 2) Performance variation
along with task increasing. Figure 4(b) shows the performance of individual tasks on NYC as the
number of tasks increases. The performance of each task is improving with the addition of more tasks,
which indicates that tasks are no longer isolated but gain the collective intelligence via assimilating
common representations and interactive information.

Parameter sensitivity analysis

We varied the dimension of the task prompt dp as {18, 36, 72, 144}, the number of attention heads in
MSTI as {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}, and the threshold δ for RoAda among {10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7}. Results
shown in Figure 6 indicate that the optimal settings were dp = 72, head = 4, and δ = 10−6. Details
of parameter analysis and fine-tuning can be found in our Appendix C.6.

Conclusion

In this work, we enable spatiotemporal learning to get rid of isolation with proposed CMuST, which
consists of two major components. In CMuST, the MSTI is devised to dissect complex multi-
dimension data correlations, to reveal disentangled patterns. To extract the task-wise consistency

and task-specific diversity, we propose a rolling learning scheme RoAda, where it simultaneously
models weight behavior to enable collective intelligence, and constructs task-specific prompts by
compressing domain data with AutoEncoding to empower task-specific refinement for enhancement.
We believe our CMuST can not only help better understand the collective regularity and intelligence
in urban systems, but significantly reduce repeated training and improve data exploitation, which
is progressively approaching green computing in future cities. For future work, we will further
investigate the collective intelligence in open urban systems, which can potentially generalize to
wider domains such as energy and environment for human-centered computing.

Explanation of Relevant Concepts

A.1
The Concept, Definition and Scope of Multi-task Learning

Actually, in our study, various domains correspond to different urban elements collected with different
manners in a given city. For instance, in an integrated urban system, it includes taxi demands, crowd
flow, traffic speed and accidents. We collect and organize various domain data (urban elements) in a
city into one integrated dataset. The goal of our work is to explore the integrated intelligence from
various domains and enhance learning of each individual urban element. To this end, the concept
of multi-task here is to forecast various elements from different domains in an integrated model.
Therefore, our work does not target at unifying regression or classification problems, but proposes
an integrated model to iteratively establish the common intelligence among different elements and
improve generalization for each element learning in succession, thus getting rid of task isolation.
Noted that our experiments are performed with regression tasks, but it can easily generalize to
classification task with shared representations.

A.2
Continuous & Continual learning

In this work, ’continuous’ is equivalent to ’continual’. The uniqueness of our work refers to a novel
continuous task learning in ST community, which collects the integrated intelligence and benefits
each individual learning task.

Methodology Details

B.1
Illustration of Data Representation and Integration

Figure 5: This figure illustrates the process of Data Representation and Integration within the
CMuST framework. T and N denote the length of the time series and the number of geographic
nodes, respectively. The diagram on the right details the encoding of information across different
dimensions, with the bottom right corner aggregating the results of all encodings into a unified
multidimensional representation.

B.2
Positional Encoding for Temporal-context Cross-interaction

Given the D dimensions in total, we define the positional encoding as,
 pos(t,2d) = sin
 
t/100002d/D

pos(t,2d+1) = cos
 
t/100002d/D
for d = 0, · · · , D/2 −1
(14)

where t and d are the indexes of time slots and feature dimensions, which alternately uses sine and
cosine to provide a unique representation for each time slot.

B.3
Fusion & Regression

Predictions for future steps are influenced by representations affected by multi-dimensional inter-
actions, where the impact of each dimension may vary. Therefore, we integrate information across
various aspects effectively by a parameter matrix-based fusion strategy,

Z = Wo ∗˜H[. . . , slice(o)] + Ws ∗˜H[. . . , slice(s)] + Wt ∗˜H[. . . , slice(t)]
(15)

where ∗denotes the convolution operation, employing 1 x 1 convolution kernels. Wo, Ws, and Wt
are the parameters within these kernels, tailored to adjust the influence of observational data, spatial
locations, and temporal information on the prediction targets, respectively. We further integrate the
task-specific prompt to culminate in the final prediction ˆY = FCy(ZWz + ˜H[. . . , slicep]Wp; θy),
the Huber Loss [26] is utilized as the optimization function, which is less sensitive to outliers
compared to squared error loss, defined as:

Ly =

1
2( ˆY −Y)2,
if | ˆY −Y| < δ
δ(| ˆY −Y| −1

2δ),
otherwise
(16)

where Y is the ground truth, δ controls the sensitivity to outliers, which enhances the accuracy by
integrating diverse data dimensions and improves robustness against data variability and anomalies.

Additional Experiment Details

C.1
Dataset Details

We provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of records in the original
data, the number of regions into which the data was divided, and the time intervals. These details are
presented in Table 3. The specific data preprocessing is as follows:

NYC: We collect yellow taxi trip data from January to March 2016 from the NYC Open Data website.
Each trip record includes information such as pickup and dropout times, locations, and the number of
passengers. We filter out records with abnormal longitude and latitude values or missing data. Then
we select data within Manhattan and surrounding areas, divided into 30x15 grids, and counted trips
per grid, selecting those with total trips greater than or equal to 1000, resulting in 206 grids. Each
grid’s data is aggregated into 30-minute intervals, yielding taxi pickup counts, taxi dropout counts,
and crowd in/out flows. We also include time of day (tod) and day of week (dow) as context, resulting
in four tasks with input features [value, tod, dow].

SIP: We collect traffic data from Suzhou Industrial Park from January to March 2017, comprising
tens of thousands of records. The area is divided into nodes, and data is aggregated into 5-minute
intervals. After filtering out grids with sparse data, we obtain 108 nodes, each containing traffic speed
and traffic flow. We include time of day and day of week as input context, resulting in two tasks:
traffic flow and traffic speed, with input [value, tod, dow].

Chicago: We collect taxi trip and accident data from the Chicago Open Data platform for June to
December 2023. The taxi data includes trip start, end times and locations. We divide the area into
30x20 grids and select grids with total trips greater than 100, resulting in 220 grids. Similar to the
NYC dataset, data is aggregated into 30-minute intervals, yielding taxi pickup and dropout counts,
resulting in two tasks with input features [value, tod, dow]. The accident data includes incident
locations, times, casualty numbers, and injury severity of each casualty. We then obtain the risk score
by weighting it according to each casualty and injury, mapped it to the 220 grids, and aggregated the
risk score over time intervals, resulting in a risk task with input features [risk score, tod, dow].

and further show the superiority of our continuous multi-task learning, our experiments are designed

33:

into both single-task learning and multi-task learning. We will further clarify how to ensure the fair
evaluation and comparisons across different models.

For single-task learning, we take different datasets as individual ones to respectively train and test the
model [23], where compared models and our CMuST are respectively and repeatedly trained for 5
times with different random seeds. The average results are reported in our Table. 1.

For multi-task learning, since existing models have not designed the task-level continuous learning
scheme, we align the features of different types of data in the same urban system into a same urban
graph, where data features are concatenated for training the model. The learning objectives are
followed by corresponding statement of each paper. For our CMuST, we implement the continuous
and iterative model update described in Sec. 4.4. The fairness is well-incorporated by ensuring the all
the data input to each model is equivalent.

The experimental results find that almost all multi-task learning can compete against single-task
learning, and our continuous multi-task learning is also superior to other multi-task learning without
explicitly capturing the task commonality and diversity.

C.3
Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we implement several strategies during the RoAda phase. Firstly, we
set the learning rate for each task to 1e-5. This helps to retain more knowledge from previous tasks
and prevents the model from over-adjusting to new tasks. By maintaining a low learning rate, the
model can incrementally learn new information while preserving the stability of previously learned
tasks. Additionally, we use task-specific weights for each task, such as task prompts. This method
allows us to absorb the common features across all tasks while independently preserving and updating
task-specific parameters. This approach ensures that when learning new tasks, the model does not
forget the knowledge gained from previous tasks, thereby preventing catastrophic forgetting and
avoiding overfitting to new tasks.

C.4
Comparison Experiments with Unified Models

We compare with unified spatiotemporal/time series learning, such as UniST [45] and UniTime [22],
to better show the generalization ability of our model for multi-task learning in the same urban system.
The results of these in Table 5.

Experiments for Cold-start

We have designed the experiment of cold start. Specifically, for NYC dataset, we selected three of the
four tasks of Crowd In, Crowd Out, Taxi Pick and Taxi Drop in turn for training, and calculated the
adaptation time and results for the remaining one task on this basis, comparing with training a single
task alone. A similar design is applied for SIP and Chicago datasets. The results are shown in Table 6,
which show that, both in terms of effect and time, it performs better than single task, indicating that
our model adapts to the newly arrived task more quickly and well, which is conducive to solving the
problem of cold start of urban prediction.

Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

To study the impact of hyperparameters on model performance, we varied the dimension of the task
prompt dp as {18, 36, 72, 144}, the number of attention heads in MSTI as {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}, and the
threshold δ for RoAda among {10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7}. The experimental results, displayed in
Figure 6, are based on analysis of three datasets. 1) Initially, as the dimension of the prompt increases,
both MAE and MAPE decrease, indicating that within a lower range, increasing dp benefits the
model by capturing more task-specific information. However, performance significantly deteriorates
after dp exceeds 72, suggesting that additional dimensions may carry redundant and non-informative
elements that introduce noise and prevent the model from effectively learning useful information. 2)
On the other hand, as the number of heads increases, model performance initially improves, allowing
the attention mechanism to capture more diverse and dimensional information through different
heads. Yet, this positive effect reverses after exceeding four heads, indicating that too many heads
can lead to information overlap, reducing efficiency and adding unnecessary complexity to the model,
thereby degrading performance. 3) During the rolling adaptation phase, both excessively high and
low values for the δ threshold lead to performance degradation. When δ is set too low, it results in
fewer stable weights being retained, which may fail to preserve essential information critical for
learning stability. Conversely, setting δ too high results in more weights being frozen, which restricts
the model’s flexibility and adaptability, locking in potentially dynamic information and preventing
the model from adapting to novel and evolving data patterns effectively.

Limitation

Our current work is confined to a single urban system and our experiments are solely within the
transportation sector. The exploration into other domains within the same city, such as electricity,
transportation, and pollution multi-task learning is still limited. Addressing these limitations will
form the basis of our future research.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: In the introduction (Section 1), we summarized the contributions of this
paper, which include the technical development of two modules: MSTI and RoAda, and
the construction of benchmark datasets for three cities. Through extensive experimentation,
we demonstrated the advantages of our CMuST framework in multi-task learning under
conditions of limited data.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the limitations of our paper and the areas requiring further
improvement in Appendix D.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

20


---Page Break---
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical assumptions and results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provided a detailed description of our model architecture, datasets, and
implementation methods. At the same time, in order to facilitate reproduction, we also
provided source code.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

21


---Page Break---
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We added the source code to an anonymous repository and provided the source
of the dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The experimental settings are presented in Section 5.1. Full details for fairness-
aware experimental evaluation are presented in Appendix C.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: For all experimental results in this paper we provided the mean of the numerous
experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

22


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provided basic information about our deployment platform and computing
power in Section 5.1.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We make sure our research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect,
with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the potential positive societal impacts of our paper in Section 6.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

23


---Page Break---
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: There are no such risks of the datasets in this paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have properly cited the original papers and web pages that produced the
code package and dataset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

24


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our code has been provided in anonymous link.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

25


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
