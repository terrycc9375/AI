Abstract

In deep learning, model performance often deteriorates when trained on highly im-
balanced datasets, especially when evaluation metrics require robust generalization
across underrepresented classes. To address the challenges posed by imbalanced
data distributions, this study introduces a novel method utilizing density ratio esti-
mation for dynamic class weight adjustment, termed as Re-weighting with Density
Ratio (RDR). Our method adaptively adjusts the importance of each class during
training, mitigates overfitting on dominant classes and enhances model adaptability
across diverse datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on various large scale
benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Results demonstrate
substantial improvements in generalization capabilities, particularly under severely
imbalanced conditions. The code is available here.

Introduction

In recent years, deep learning has made significant strides across various domains by utilizing
complex architectures and large-scale datasets, setting new benchmarks for performance. However,
these advancements often rely on well-curated datasets that ensure balanced class distributions
[Russakovsky et al., 2015]. In contrast, real-world datasets typically exhibit a long-tailed distribution,
where few classes dominate the majority of samples, while many others are underrepresented
[Krizhevsky et al., 2009]. This imbalance leads to model biases favoring frequent classes, thereby
reducing performance on the less common ones. Yet, in many applications—such as medical
diagnostics and financial analysis—greater emphasis is placed on ensuring strong generalization for
underrepresented classes. Addressing this challenge not only reduces data collection costs but also
improves the robustness and fairness of the models.

Many excellent methods, such as re-sampling [Bowyer et al., 2011], re-weighting [Morik et al.,
1999], decoupled learning [Kang et al., 2020], margin-based learning [Cao et al., 2019, Menon et al.,

2020], transfer learning [Yin et al., 2019] and contrastive learning [Tian et al., 2021], have been
proposed to tackle the issue of imbalanced data. Despite the simplicity of re-weighting, it falls behind
in performance significantly compared with other directions of methods due to the inappropriate
weighting coefficients during training. Cui et al. [2019] proposes a method for re-weighting by
effective number, which accounts for potential overlaps among data samples and adjusts the weights
for each category based on the actual effective number of samples. Chen et al. [2023b] leverages
the effective area to re-weight, considering the actual spanned space of each class. However, such
subsequent improvements can alleviate but still cannot effectively push that forward. Wang et al.

[2023] obtains a fine-grained generalization bound for re-weighting in imbalanced learning through
the data-dependent contraction technique. Limited research has focused on the intrinsic limitations
of the commonly employed re-weighting-based loss functions and the corresponding balancing
mechanisms designed to enhance parity in class representation.

This study rethinks the characteristics of re-weighted loss and explores the question "Why is re-
weighting necessary under conditions of sample imbalance?" Under conditions of sample imbalance,
the variation in weights of samples arises due to discrepancies between the distribution of collected
data and a balanced data distribution. In scenarios where class balance exists, such discrepancies are
absent, thus obviating the need for re-weighting. Conversely, in imbalanced settings, re-weighting
becomes essential to bridge the gap between these distributions. The weights must therefore repre-
sent a suitable compromise between balanced and imbalanced distributions and necessarily reflect
accurately on each sample. Additionally, as model training progresses dynamically, optimizing the
fit to feature distributions, the weights applied to each sample should be continuously updated to
maintain robust performance.

This research introduces a novel method, Reweighting with Density Ratio (RDR), designed to
mitigate learning disparities in imbalanced distributions. In this method, a feature extractor is
employed to discern the features from the training data. A more balanced feature distribution is
approximated by continuously updating the momentum on the feature level. This enables real-time
density ratio estimation with features learned under imbalanced distributions, thereby obtaining
the sample-wise weights. Notably, as the learned features evolve, our method dynamically adjusts
weights in response to observed shifts in class density throughout the training cycle, ensuring that
the model remains adaptive and effective. This method significantly enhances the robustness and
adaptability of the training process. By integrating density ratio estimation to evaluate the difference
between the balanced and real data distributions, our approach more accurately reflects the underlying
class distribution and improves the model’s generalization capabilities across diverse datasets. The
contributions are summarized as follows:

• We explore the existing re-weighting techniques, and model the performance of various algorithms
during training under different data distributions. This approach offers a novel perspective on
understanding re-weighting methods in the scenarios of sample imbalance.

• We introduce a novel methodology, Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR), which leverages the
method of density ratio estimation to dynamically adjust class weights during model training. This
approach not only addresses the limitations of prior re-weighting methods but also introduces a
mechanism to continuously adapt to the changing importance of classes as learning progresses,
thereby enhancing model robustness and adaptability.

• We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed RDR method. These
experiments are conducted across various large-scale, long-tailed datasets, demonstrating substan-
tial improvements in handling class imbalance. Our results illustrate significant enhancements in
generalization capabilities, particularly under severely imbalanced scenarios.

Related Work

2.1
Re-weighting Based Methods

Re-weighting methods for addressing class imbalance have evolved significantly over the years. Early
techniques, such as [Zadrozny et al., 2003], employed inverse frequency techniques to address class
imbalances but failed to consider deeper data distribution traits, leading to sub-optimal outcomes.
Addressing these shortcomings, Huang et al. [2016] introduced a cost-sensitive learning framework
that, beyond simple frequency adjustments, incorporated misclassification costs to achieve a more
nuanced balance. However, this approach still struggled with complexities like class overlap and
label noise. To further refine this approach, Lin et al. [2017] developed Focal Loss, which employs a
modulation factor based on the prediction probability to adjust the loss function, thereby amplifying
the impact of hard-to-classify samples while reducing the loss contribution of easy-to-classify samples.
Cui et al. [2019] introduced Class-Balanced Loss, which adjusts loss by data overlap, calculating the
effective number of each class. Advancements continued with methods based on training gradients,
such as [Ren et al., 2020b, Wang et al., 2021a]. Chen et al. [2023b] proposed Adaptive Re-weighting
via effective area, which enhances model accuracy by considering the spatial distribution and density

---Page Break---
of data points within classes. Ma et al. [2023] introduced a re-weighting method that adjusts based
on semantic richness and visual variability. However, no prior work has tackled the issue of sample
imbalance by dynamically re-weighting based on the model’s performance across training and test
sets with differing distributions during the training process.

2.2
Non-re-weighting Based Methods

In addition to re-weighting, many other methods are available to address the issue of sample imbalance.
Re-sampling techniques [Kubat and Matwin, 1997, Wallace et al., 2011, Han et al., 2005, Hong
et al., 2024a] mitigate category imbalances by under-sampling dominant classes [Buda et al., 2018]
or over-sampling minority classes [Bowyer et al., 2011]. However, under-sampling may degrade
feature representation by discarding valuable majority class data, whereas over-sampling could cause
overfitting by duplicating minority class samples. Decoupled training approaches, such as [Kang
et al., 2020], challenge the traditional joint training model by separating representation learning from
classification. Margin-based methods such as, LADM [Cao et al., 2019], LA [Menon et al., 2020]
and VS [Kini et al., 2021], adjust training processes to increase minority class margins, therefore to
obtain a more balanced decision boundary. More flexible and robust methods are proposed, including
Transfer Learning [Yin et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], Contrastive Learning [Li et al., 2022, Chen
et al., 2023a], Ensemble Learning [Wang et al., 2021b, Cai et al., 2021] and Self-supervised Learning
[Liu et al., 2022, Zhou et al., 2023b]. Please refer to Appendix B for more discussions.

Method

3.1
Problem Setup

For a typical classification task in imbalanced learning, suppose given a training dataset S =
Sn
i=1{(xi, yi)}, where n is the total number of samples. Denote {n1, n2, ..., nd}as the sample
number of each class. We assume, without loss of generality, that ni < nj, when i < j, with nd
typically much larger than n1, reflecting a pronounced imbalance in class distribution. We use a
typical loss function like l: W × X × Y →R+. Denote {π1, π2, ..., πd} as the proportions of
each class, such that Pd
i=1 πi = 1. Define a family of deep learning models parameterized by
ω ∈W ⊆Rk. Typically, a model consists of a feature extractor f(x; ϕ) and a classifier h(z; θ), with
ω = S{ϕ, θ}. The notations used in this paper are summarized in Appendix A.

3.2
Motivation

Inspired by our review of prior methods, we observe a gap in the adaptation of dynamic class-weight
adjustments during training phases. Building on the groundwork of static re-weighting strategies, we
introduce a novel approach utilizing the method of density ratio estimation to dynamically recalibrate
class weights. This innovation aims to provide a more refined adjustment by estimating real-time
class density, thereby promoting an equitable influence of all classes throughout the training.

3.3
Dynamic Re-weighting with Density Ratio

In a typical training optimization problem, our objective is to minimize the empirical risk of the loss
function, i.e., R = 1

n
Pn
i=1 l(xi, yi; ω). However, in imbalanced datasets, where the frequency of
samples across different classes varies, it is necessary to adjust for these gaps by applying different
weights for the samples. We assume that the weight of each sample is denoted by α(x, y; ω), then the
empirical risk can be formulated like R = 1

n
Pn
i=1 α(xi, yi; ω)l(xi, yi; ω).

In naive re-weighting approaches, the weight α of class y is often set to
1
πy . This setting is based
on the assumption that the distribution of the training set P and the distribution balanced data set
Pbal satisfy the equation P(x|y; ω) = Pbal(x|y; ω). However, in practical training scenarios, both
training and test sets are subsets drawn from the actual distribution, leading to potential missing of
feature patterns. Furthermore, classes with more complex features and lower sample frequencies tend
to exhibit more pronounced missing of patterns. Therefore, in the training process, there exists a
discrepancy between P(x|y; ω) and Pbal(x|y; ω). We measure the extent of this discrepancy using the
ratio r(x|y; w) = P(x|y; ω)/Pbal(x|y; ω), incorporating it as a correction term into our weighting

scheme. Consequently, the empirical risk can be reformulated as follows

R = 1

n

n
X

i=1

r(xi|yi; ω)

πyi
l(xi, yi; ω)
(1)

We can explain the rationality of this formula as follows.
Considering each class i, where
Pbal(yi; ω) ∝π−1
i
P(yi; ω) and Pbal(xi|yi; ω) = r(xi|yi; ω)P(xi|yi; ω), with conditional prob-
ability formula, we can derive:

R = EP
1
πi
(r(xi|yi; ω)l(xi, yi; ω)) = EP
Pbal(y; ω)

P(y; ω)
Pbal(x|y; ω)

P(x|y; ω) l(x, y; ω)

= EP

Pbal(x, y; ω)

P(x, y; ω) l(x, y; ω)

= EPball(x, y; ω)
(2)

Eq. (2) demonstrates that our approach aligns with the balanced risk of the loss function. Consequently,
minimizing Eq. (1) also serves to minimize the balanced risk.

Let’s take a closer look at r(x|y; w) = P(x|y; ω)/Pbal(x|y; ω). The variable r represents the ratio
of two different distributions. We approximate this ratio using methods of density ratio estimation.
This problem can be solved by first-order moment matching approach. Our goal is to minimize

where ∥·∥denotes the Euclidean norm. Recall that we capture the features of the input samples by
the feature extractor f(x; ϕ) in our model, and these features are a good reflection of what our model
learned from the distribution of the input samples. Therefore, in order to capture more complex
structures and patterns in raw data, we use f(x; ϕ) to obtain a variant of Eq. (3). Our goal can be
achieved by obtaining argminr MM
′(r), where MM
′(r) denotes


Z
f(x; ϕ)r(x|y; ω)Pbal(x|y; ω)dx −
Z
f(x; ϕ)P(x|y; ω)dx


2
(4)

where MM stands for ’moment matching’. Let us ignore the irrelevant constant in MM
′(r), and
define the rest as MM(r):

(5)

where ⟨·, ·⟩denotes the inner product. In practice, as for the real-world imbalanced data distribution
P, we denote ΦP to dynamically reflect the knowledge learned from the distribution P, that is
ΦP = (f(x1; ϕ), . . . , f(xn; ϕ)). Remember that the output of feature extractor is z, i.e., z = f(x; ϕ)
is a Z-dimensional vector, then ΦP would be a [Z, n]-dimensional vector. Similarly, we denote Φi
P
for class i, which is a [Z, ni]-dimensional vector. As for the balanced data distribution Pbal, we
design a momentum mechanism to accumulatively estimate the expectation of features learned from
balanced data distribution along with the training. Concretely, for each class, we maintain a prototype
feature F for the entire training progress, using each batch’s feature expectation for momentum
updates. Therefore, we define FPbal as follows FPbal = (F1, . . . , Fd).

Since the total number of classes is d, FPbal would be a [Z, d]-dimensional vector. For each batch, we
can obtain z = (z1, . . . , zd), where zi the mean of z of all samples in class i. Then, the momentum
updates works as follows
FPbal ←mFPbal + (1 −m)z
(6)

where m ∈[0, 1) is a momentum coefficient. Back to Eq. (5), replace the expectations over Pbal
and P by ΦP and FPbal, respectively. Then, take the derivative of MM(r) with respect to r and set
it to zero. Detailed derivations are provided in Appendix C.1. For each class i, we can obtain the
estimation of density ratio in imbalanced learning as follows

In our implementation, we introduced a warm-up phase to pre-adapt the feature distribution in
FPbal, thereby mitigating excessive oscillations during the initial stages of training. Additionally, we
employed a temperature coefficient γ to modulate the influence of weights, which is typically set to 1.
When integrating with logit adjustment (LA) [Menon et al., 2020], we adhere to the same procedures
outlined in [Wang et al., 2023] to ensure the fisher consistency. The framework and pseudo-code of
our method are shown in Appendix C.2 and Appendix C.3.

3.4
Generalization Bound Analysis

Here, we use a formal generalization analysis to characterize the interesting point of our method.

Theorem 1. Given a model m ∈M and the loss function l, for any δ ∈(0, 1), with probability at
least 1 −δ over the training set S, according to [Wang et al., 2023], the following generalization
bound holds for the risk on the balanced distribution

dπ1

d
X

y=1
wy√πy [1 −softmax (By(m))]
(9)

where Φ (l, δ) is positively correlated with the empirical re-weighting risk of the training set. CS(M)
denotes the empirical complexity of the function set M. By(f) denotes the minimal prediction on the
ground-truth class y in the training set. wy refers to the weight of class y of the re-weighting loss.

Specifically, from the above generalization bound, we can find two inherent requirements for re-
weighting methods. 1) Why re-weighting is necessary: wy helps to re-balance the imbalanced term
√πy [1 −softmax (By(m))] to get a sharper bound. 2) Why dynamic re-weighting is necessary:
The term By(m) changes dynamically with model training. Therefore, we need a wy that can adapt
dynamically to the changes of By(m). 3) Why RDR works: From Fig. 1, we can observe that the
dynamic trend of the RDR weight aligns well with √πy [1 −softmax (By(m))], denoted as B′
y.
This shows that our RDR can adapt to the dynamics in B′
y, maintaining a sharp bound during training.

3.5
Implementation and Complexity Analysis

At the end of each epoch, a global variable is maintained and updated using momentum, as described
by Eq. (6). Within each minibatch, the weight of each sample is computed dynamically. Typical

5


---Page Break---
optimization procedures for deep neural networks entail both forward and backward passes per mini-
batch, characterized by a computational complexity of O(BΛ), where B represents the batch size
and Λ denotes the overall parameter size. Within the RDR framework, suppose the feature dimension
used as input to the classifier is K, and the sample weights are computed according to Eq. (8). This
computation for all d classes aggregates to a complexity of O(Pd
i=1(ni × K2 + K3)) where ni
is the sample count of class i in a minibatch. Given that K generally exceeds ni, the complexity
predominantly stems from the matrix inversion, approximating to O(dK3). The complexity for
momentum updates is O(BK). Notice that K and B are considerably minor relative to the scale of
the model parameters, rendering the time overhead of this method manageable.

On the storage front, the memory cost of the RDR primarily arises from the matrix inversion step
in Eq. (8), resulting in a space complexity of O(K2). Given the scales of K is much lower than
Λ, the extra memory usage is negligible when compared with the memory utilization of the model
parameters. To this end, RDR imposes a relatively small computational or space cost, enabling its
integration with existing approaches at a reduced cost. An empirical evaluation of the computational
expense is presented in Fig. 2. For more discussions about limitations of RDR , please refer to

Experimental Setup

Datasets. We conduct experiments on four major long-tailed datasets, CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT,
ImageNet-LT [Liu et al., 2019] and Places-LT [Liu et al., 2019]. CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT
are two datasets sampled from the original CIFAR [Krizhevsky et al., 2009] dataset with a total of 10
and 100 classes, respectively. We conduct experiments with different imbalance factors IF = nmax

nmin ,
where nmax and nmin denotes the number of the most and least frequent classes [Kang et al., 2020,
Hong et al., 2023, 2024b]. Following the mainstream protocol [Wang et al., 2023], we set the
imbalance factor as 100 and 10 for evaluation. ImageNet-LT has 115.8K training images covering
1000 classes, with imbalance factor being 256. The number of samples per class ranges from 1280 to
5 images. Places-LT contains 62.5K training images covering 365 categories, with imbalance factor
being 996. The number of samples per class ranges from 4980 to 5 images.

Evaluation Protocol. In the task of long-tailed classification, all classes are treated equally during
testing. Following [Rangwani et al., 2022, Zhou et al., 2023c], we also report accuracy on three
splits of classes according to the number of training data. Since the number of samples per class
increases by its class index, for CIFAR-10-LT dataset, class[0, 3), class[3, 7) and class[7, 10) are
reported as Many, Medium and Few classes, respectively. Similarly, CIFAR-100-LT is splited as
class[0, 35), class[35, 69) and class[69, 100). ImageNet-LT is splited as class[0, 390), class[390, 835)
and class[835, 1000), while Places-LT is splited as class[0, 131), class[131, 288) and class[288, 365).

Baselines. Our method is combined with existing long-tailed classification methods to demonstrate
the efficacy, including the baseline trained by cross-entropy loss (CE), focal loss (Focal) [Lin et al.,
2017], class-balanced loss (CB) [Cui et al., 2019] and logit adjustment (LA) [Menon et al., 2020].
Recently, Sharpness-Aware minimization (SAM) [Foret et al., 2021] has been proved to be a powerful
method in imbalanced learning, therefore we also adopt baseline including SAM [Foret et al., 2021],

Implementation details. Our code is implemented with Pytorch 1.12.1. Experiments based on
CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT are carried out on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs, while
experiments based on ImageNet-LT and Places-LT are carried out on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. For a fair
comparison, we use ResNet32 on CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT, ResNet50 on ImageNet-LT and
pre-trained ResNet-152 on Places-LT. We train each model with batch size of 128 (for CIFAR-10-LT
and CIFAR-100-LT) / 256 (for Places-LT and ImageNet-LT), SGD optimizer with momentum of 0.9,
weight decay of 0.0002. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1, with cosine learning-rate scheduling
along training. The results of ImbSAM and CCSAM are obtained by implementing the official codes.

Comparison Results

Comparative analyses have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RDR. The
results are presented in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 4. The metric employed to measure performance
is the top-1 accuracy on the test sets.

Results on CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT. We first evaluate RDR on CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-
100-LT. We report the final accuracy of different methods with imbalance factor ratio {10, 100} in
Table 1 and Table 2. We can observe that RDR significantly outperforms all baselines under different
imbalance factor ratios across the two datasets. Our observations highlight that RDR consistently
outperforms baselines across various class distributions—Many, Medium, and Few—particularly
under severe imbalance (IF=100).

In CIFAR-10-LT, combined with CE and LA, our method shows substantial improvement in the
categories with fewer samples, increasing the accuracy by 19.8% and 9.5% respectively in the Few
category under IF=100. This improvement is notable as it effectively addresses the challenge of
learning from scarce data. With the inclusion of SAM, the performance of RDR is further enhanced.
Under a less severe imbalance (IF=10), where the results show less performance drop-off between
categories, RDR combined methods still maintain high performance across all categories, suggesting
scalability and reliability of our approach in different imbalance contexts.

In CIFAR-100-LT, where the data distributions are more diverse and challenging, RDR also enhances
the overall performance, particularly for the Medium and Few categories. Under the imbalance factor
of 10 and 100, RDR increases the accuracy in Few classes by 11.8% and 20.0% respectively, compared
to the original CE loss. Furthermore, it is notable that techniques like ImbSAM and CCSAM, which
especially focus on the Few categories, may heavily sacrifice the performance on Many classes. The
results in both datasets show that RDR generally outperforms in the Many classes compared to the
other two variants of SAM, indicating that RDR can efficiently address the overfitting issues for Few
classes. For more experimental details, please refer to Appendix D.2 and Appendix D.1.

Flat minima of loss landscape. Key metrics associated with Eigen Spectral Density, such as
the maximum and minimum eigenvalues (λmax and λmin) and the trace of the Hessian matrix
(Tr(H)), effectively reflect the smoothness of the loss landscape. Lower values of λmax and Tr(H)
indicate a smoother loss landscape. Rangwani et al. [2022] have demonstrated that smoother loss
landscapes correlate with stronger model generalization, which is particularly crucial when dealing

with imbalanced data. λmin also serves as a significant indicator of the loss landscape characteristics.
A preponderance of negative eigenvalues from the Hessian spectrum, resulting in smaller λmin values,
empirically suggests convergence to saddle points. Saddle points typically represent regions in the
loss landscape characterized by a plateau with some negative curvature. In non-convex settings, it has
been shown that an exponential number of saddle points exist, and convergence to these points is
indicative of poor generalization.

Fig. 4 illustrates the Eigen Spectral Density under different loss function training regimes. It is
evident that combining our method with the CE technique significantly improves the loss landscape.
On one hand, λmax is substantially reduced, indicating a flatter loss landscape. On the other hand,
there is an increase in λmin, suggesting our method’s effectiveness in escaping from saddle points.

Table 3 delves deeper into the changes in the loss landscape for all Few classes. It reveals that
combining our method with CE and SAM results in average reductions in λmax by 58.5% and 66.1%,
respectively, and increases in λmin by 49.2% and 7.6%, respectively. Furthermore, our method
significantly reduces Tr(H) for minority classes (class7, class8 and class9). The average value of
Tr(H) decreases by 55.7% and 66.0% when combined with CE and SAM, respectively. These
findings underscore the efficacy of our method in improving the loss landscape and enhancing the
generalization capability of the model [Dauphin et al., 2014].

Results on ImageNet-LT and Places-LT. Our experiments conducted on ImageNet-LT and Places-
LT, two large-scale datasets characterized by irregular and complex data distributions, demonstrate
notable accuracy improvements through the application of RDR, as shown in Table 1 and Table 4.

Specifically, when combined with CE and LA on ImageNet-LT, our method achieves accuracy
enhancements of 18.7% and 2% in Few classes, respectively. While the SAM technique combined
with CE and LA offers limited accuracy improvements, its integration with our approach still results
in an overall accuracy increase of approximately 2.3% compared to other methods. Notably, the LA
method tends to suppress accuracy in Many classes more than the CE method; however, this side
effect is effectively mitigated when LA is combined with RDR.

In the Places-LT dataset, the performance of RDR is even more pronounced. Combinations of our
method with CE and LA result in accuracy gains of 10.1% and 2% in overall classes, respectively.
Additionally, integrating SAM with our method also yields incremental improvements of 10.3%
and 0.5% under CE and LA conditions, respectively. Our approach not only enhances accuracy
in Few classes but also surpasses other methods in Medium classes, indicating its comprehensive
efficacy across different categories. This broad applicability is particularly crucial for addressing the
challenges of imbalanced learning.

Results on data with label noise. We further investigate the performance of our approach on datasets
with label noise. Specifically, we evaluate two datasets: CIFAR-10-LT-NL and CIFAR-100-LT-NL,
both of which exhibit class imbalance and label noise. Experiments are conducted with a noise ratio
of 5%, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. As shown, our method demonstrates consistent and
significant improvements on more datasets with label noise.

Ablation Study

In our study, we perform an ablation experiment to validate the efficacy of the multiple components
that comprise our method. The outcomes from experiments across four datasets are delineated in
Table 5. It is crucial to note that our weighting definition for each category i follows the formula
w = r/ni. When r = 1, our method simplifies to the traditional inverse frequency weighting
w = 1/ni. We explored the differences between our approach with and without the integration of
SAM compared to this conventional weighting method.

The results depicted in Table 5 reveal that our dynamic weighting approach consistently outperforms
the classic method under various scenarios. Without SAM, when combined with CE and LA, our
method achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.4% to 4.3% and 0.3% to 2.3%, respectively.
When integrated with SAM, the improvement in accuracy is particularly notable on large datasets.
Specifically, the accuracy enhancements on ImageNet-LT and Places-LT reach 7.1% and 1.9%
respectively when combined with LA. These results underscore the tangible benefits of our dynamic
weighting strategy in enhancing model performance. The impact of momentum coefficient m in RDR
is shown in Fig. 3. For more experimental details, please refer to Appendix D.3.

Conclusion

In this work, we have introduced RDR, a novel approach for mitigating model degradation in
imbalanced learning scenarios by dynamically adjusting class weights using density ratio estimation.
Our method dynamically adjusts class weights during training based on density ratio estimation,
enhancing both model robustness and adaptability. Extensive experiments on diverse large-scale
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RDR, particularly in severely imbalanced settings. Future
work will focus on refining the dynamic adjustment mechanisms and exploring broader applicability
across various domains and dataset complexities.

More Discussions of Related Work

Beyond imbalanced classification that has discretized label space, an noteworthy area, imbalanced
regression that has a continuous label space is also very common in real applications [Yang et al., 2021,
Gong et al., 2022]. In this direction, the empirical label distribution often does not accurately reflect
the true label density in regression tasks, which limits the effectiveness of traditional re-weighting
techniques [Yang et al., 2021, Wang and Wang, 2023]. Label Distribution Smoothing (LDS) [Yang
et al., 2021] and Variational Imbalanced Regression (VIR) [Wang and Wang, 2023] propose using
kernel smoothing and other techniques to estimate an accurate label density distribution. Ranking
Similarity (Ranksim) [Gong et al., 2022] leverages local and global dependencies by encouraging the
correspondence between the similarity order of labels and features. Balanced Mean Squared Error
(Balanced MSE) [Ren et al., 2022] extends the concept of Balanced Softmax [Ren et al., 2020a]
to regression tasks to achieve a balanced predictive distribution. Contrastive Regularizer (ConR)
[Keramati et al., 2024] improves contrastive learning techniques to translate label similarities into the
feature space.

We provide the pseudo-code of RDR to demonstrate the process of implementing our method in
detail, as shown in Algorithm 1. In addition, we also provide pseudo-code that combines our method

Supplement for Experiments

D.1
Experiment with More Imbalanced Data

We conduct experiments on the more imbalanced CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT datasets, specifi-
cally with imbalance factors of 200 and 500. As shown in Table 7, our method consistently achieves
significant improvements.

D.2
Dynamically Re-weighting Process

Our approach dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each category throughout the training
process. To gain more insights into RDR, we sampled the weights of each category during training.
Fig. 7 presents the results of four samplings during the training processes at imbalance factors of 10
and 100, respectively.

The analysis of these results reveals a consistent trend in weight changes across different imbalance
factors. For the Many classes, the weights of the categories consistently decrease during training.
Specifically, under the IF of 10, the weights of class0, class1, and class2 (the three classes with the
highest sample counts, in descending order) decrease by 5.6%, 6.7%, and 8.0%, respectively. Under
the IF of 100, these decreases are more pronounced, with reductions of 10.3%, 15.4%, and 14.7%,
respectively. For the Medium classes, the weight changes are less marked, with an average decrease

Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10-LT. (a), (b), and (c) illustrate the weight changes for Many,
Medium, and Few classes, respectively, under an imbalance factor of 10. (d), (e), and (f) correspond-
ingly show the changes for each class type under an imbalance factor of 100.

of 3.7% at IF=10 and 0.3% at IF=100. For the Few classes, there exits a notable increase in weights
during training; at IF=10, the weights of class7, class8, and class9 increase by 2.3%, 6.3%, and 9.4%,
respectively, while at IF=100, they increase by 6.2%, 6.5%, and 3.2%.

These results suggest that our method increasingly focuses on minority classes as training progresses.
Initially, our method effectively learns common features across all categories, while later in training,
increasing the weights helps to target learning towards minority samples, thereby enhancing the
model’s generalizability. Wang et al. [2023] also corroborate these findings.

D.3
Ablation Study

We provide more detailed experimental results for each category in ablation study, as illustrated
in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. From these figures, we can find that across various datasets and different
imbalance factors, our method significantly enhances the generalizability of both Few classes and
Medium classes. Moreover, our method maintains superior performance when combined with the
SAM method.

More Discussions about Limitations

While our approach demonstrates promising results, there are potential challenges that warrant further
attention. In particular, as the number of classes increases to a very large scale, especially in certain
tasks such as face recognition, retail product recommendation, or landmark detection, there could
be concerns regarding computational efficiency. It is important to consider lightweight techniques
to ensure that scalability does not compromise practical applicability. Additionally, in addressing
imbalanced learning, care must be taken to avoid excessive rebalancing toward minority groups, as
this could unintentionally affect the learning performance of the majority class, which would not align
with the broader goals of fairness. Rebalancing should be conducted within a reasonable framework,
mindful of avoiding misuse or overcompensation that could arise from improper manipulation by any
group. Ensuring fairness for all remains a critical consideration.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The abstract and introduction have stated the claims.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 3.5 and Appendix E.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

21


---Page Break---
Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4 and Appendix C.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

22


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The code of this paper will be released after anonymized review.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: See Section 4.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report error bars for CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT dataset. For the
large scale ImageNet-LT and Places-LT, we do not report error bars due to computational
constraints.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

23


---Page Break---
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Section 3 and Section 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: This paper is conducted with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our proposed method can enhance the efficiency and robustness of imbalance
learning, thereby increasing productivity.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

24


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not use such assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

25


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
