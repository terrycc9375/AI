Abstract

Novel view synthesis from sparse inputs is a vital yet challenging task in 3D
computer vision. Previous methods explore 3D Gaussian Splatting with neural
priors (e.g. depth priors) as an additional supervision, demonstrating promising
quality and efficiency compared to the NeRF based methods. However, the neural
priors from 2D pretrained models are often noisy and blurry, which struggle
to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields. In this paper, We propose
a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian
Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. Our key idea lies
in exploring the self-supervisions inherent in the binocular stereo consistency
between each pair of binocular images constructed with disparity-guided image
warping. To this end, we additionally introduce a Gaussian opacity constraint
which regularizes the Gaussian locations and avoids Gaussian redundancy for
improving the robustness and efficiency of inferring 3D Gaussians from sparse
views. Extensive experiments on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Project

Introduction

3D reconstruction technologies [28, 19] have demonstrated significant advances in synthesizing
realistic novel views given a set of dense input views. To explore the challenging task in harsh
real-world situations where only sparse inputs are available, some studies learn NeRF [28] with
specially designed constraints [17, 44, 43, 49] and regularizations [30, 54, 50] on the view scarcity.
However, NeRF-based methods often suffer from slow training and inference speeds, leading to high
computational costs that restrict their practical applications.

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [19] has achieved notable advantages in rendering quality and
efficiency. However, 3DGS is still facing severe challenges with inputting sparse views, where the
unstructured 3D Gaussians with limited constraints tend to overfit the given few views, resulting
in geometric inaccuracies for scene learning. Some recent studies [31, 71, 22, 51] on sparse view
synthesis based on 3DGS employ the commonly-used depth priors from pre-trained models as
additional constraints on the Gaussians geometries. However, the neural priors are often noisy and
blurry, which struggle to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields.

In this paper, we aim to design a method that does not require external prior as supervision, which
directly explores the self-supervisions from the few input views for improving the quality and

efficiency of sparse 3DGS. We justify that the key factors in achieving this goal include 1) learning
more accurate scene geometry of Gaussians which leads to consistent views synthesis, and 2) avoiding
redundant Gaussians near the surface for better efficiency and filtering noises.

For learning more accurate scene geometry of Gaussians, we explore the self-supervisions inherent in
the binocular stereo consistency to constrain on the rendered depth of 3DGS solely utilized from given
input views and synthesized novel views. Our key insight lies in the observation that binocular image
pairs implicitly involve the property of view consistency, as demonstrated in the binocular stereo
vision methods [12, 11, 58]. Specifically, we first translate the camera of one input view slightly to
the left or right to obtain a translational view, from which we render the image and depth from 3DGS.
The rendered image and the input one thus form a left-right view pair as in binocular stereo vision.
We then leverage the rendered depth and the known camera intrinsic to compute the disparity of the
view pair. We conduct the supervisions by warping the rendered image of the translational view to
the viewpoint of the input image using the disparity, and constrains on the consistency between the
warped and input images.

To further reduce redundant Gaussians near the scene surface and enhance the quality and efficiency
of novel view synthesis, we propose a decay schema for the opacity of Gaussians. Specifically, we
simply apply a decay coefficient to the opacity property of the Gaussians, penalizing the opacity
during training. To this end, Gaussians with lower opacity gradients (i.e., where the increase in
opacity is smaller than the decay) are pruned, while Gaussians with higher opacity gradients (i.e.,
where the increase in opacity is greater than the decay) are retained. As the optimization process
continues, redundant Gaussians are filtered out, and those newly generated (copied or split) Gaussians
that are closer to the scene surface are retained, resulting in cleaner and more robust Gaussians. This
opacity decay strategy significantly reduces artifacts in novel views and decreases the number of
Gaussians, improving both the rendering quality and optimization efficiency of 3DGS.

Additionally, to achieve better geometry initialization for improving 3DGS quality when conducting
optimization on sparse views, we use pre-trained keypoints matching network [42] to generate a
dense initialization point cloud. The dense point cloud describes the geometry of the scene more
accurately, preventing Gaussians from appearing far from the scene surface, especially in low-texture
areas where the distribution of Gaussians is subject to limited constraints.

In summary, our main contributions are as follows.

• We propose a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian
Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. We explore the self-supervisions
inherent in the binocular stereo consistency to constrain the rendered depth, solely obtained
from existing input views and synthesized views.

• We propose an opacity decay strategy which significantly regularizes the learning of Gaus-
sians and reduces redundancy among Gaussians, leading to better rendering quality and
optimization efficiency for novel view synthesis from sparse view with Gaussian Splatting.

• Extensive experiments on widely-used forward-facing and 360-degree scene datasets demon-
strate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing sparse novel
view synthesis methods.

Neural implicit functions have made great progress in surface reconstruction [45, 65, 16, 64, 56, 62,

and realistic 3D scene representation has always been the research goal in the field of computer
vision, and neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [28] has brought fundamental innovation to this domain.
NeRF can reconstruct high-quality 3D scenes from sparse 2D images and generate realistic images
from arbitrary viewpoints by representing scenes as continuous volume radiance functions.

However, NeRF requires a large number of views as input during the training stage and exhibits
limitations in both training and inference speed. Consequently, the following researches have
primarily focused on addressing these bottlenecks by improving computational efficiency [10, 29, 39,

Notably, recent approach 3D Gaussian Splatting [19] has shown promising results in achieving
real-time rendering capabilities without compromising rendering quality.

3D Gaussian Splatting [19] is an emerging method for novel view synthesis, which reconstructs
high quality scenes rapidly by utilizing a set of 3D Gaussians to represent the radiance field in the
scene. This method performs excellently when dealing with real-world scenes, particularly excelling
in handling high-frequency details. Moreover, 3D Gaussian Splatting demonstrates significant
advantages in inference speed and offers more intuitive editing and interpretability capabilities.

Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Views

Recent researches [30, 17, 44, 43, 6, 49, 37, 21, 8, 38, 36, 40, 50] have explored various approaches
to generate novel views from sparse input images, focusing on enhancing both rendering quality and
efficiency. Methods such as NeRF[28] and 3DGS [19] have been refined through various techniques,
resulting in continuous improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Using depth priors obtained from pre-trained networks [55, 32, 33] to supervise neural radiance fields
is a widely used technique [38, 44]. Some methods [30, 54, 50, 8] introduce regularization terms in
NeRF to address the problem, such as frequency regularization [54] and ray entropy regularization
[20]. Additionally, there are also some methods [50, 49, 17] that leverage pre-trained models such as
Diffusion model to enhance the rendering quality of novel views. However, most methods incur high
costs during training and inference. While some methods have improved inference efficiency through
generalizable models [5, 57, 52] or by using voxel grids [40], they often sacrifice rendering quality.

Currently, with the advent of 3D Gaussian splatting, some methods use 3DGS for sparse view
synthesis, such as FSGS [71], SparseGS [51], DNGaussian [22] and CoherentGS [31]. These
methods utilize depth priors obtained from pre-trained models [32] as supervision. Depth constraints
enable the unstructured Gaussians to approximately distribute along the scene surface, thereby
enhancing the quality of novel view images. However, the depth priors from pre-trained models often
contain significant errors and cannot make the Gaussians distribute to optimal positions. In contrast,
our method employs view consistency constraints based on binocular vision, resulting in more
accurate depth information and thereby achieving a more optimal distribution of Gaussians. Some
concurrent studies [48, 34] also employed the concept of binocular stereo in 3DGS [19], but they
feed binocular images into a pre-trained network to obtain depth priors, instead of self-supervision.

The pipeline of our method is depicted in Figure 1. In this section, we first review the 3D representa-
tion method based on 3D Gaussians. Then, we explain how to construct stereo view pair and utilize
it to enforce view consistency in a self-supervised manner. Next, we introduce the opacity decay
strategy and the dense initialization method for 3D Gaussians. Finally, we present the overall loss
function used for optimization.

Review of 3D Gaussian Splatting

Gaussian splatting [19] represents scene with a set of 3D Gaussians. Each 3D Gaussian is defined by
a central location µ ∈R3, and a covariance matrix Σ ∈R3×3. Formally, it is defined as

Gi(x) = e−1

2 (x−µi)T Σ−1(x−µi),
(1)

where the covariance matrix Σ has physical meaning only when it is positive semi-definite. Therefore,
it can be decomposed into Σ = RSST RT , S ∈R3 is a diagonal scaling matrix with 3 parameters,
R ∈R4 is a rotation matrix analytically expressed with quaternions. In addition, for rendering the
image, each Gaussian also stores an opacity value α ∈R and a color feature f ∈Rk.

The 3D Gaussian is projected into the 2D image space when rendering an image, the projected 2D
Gaussian is sorted by its depth value, and then alpha blending is used to calculate the color of each
pixel,

c =

n
X

i=1
ciα′
i

i−1
Y

j=1
(1 −α′
j),
(2)

where ci is the color computed from feature f and α′ is the opacity of the 2D Gaussian, which is
obtained by multiplying the covariance Σ′ of the 2D Gaussian by the opacity α of the corresponding
3D Gaussian. The 2D covariance matrix Σ′ is calculated by Σ′ = JWΣW T JT , where J is the
Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projective transformation. W is the view transformation
matrix.

The optimization process of Gaussian splatting is initialized with a set of 3D Gaussians from a sparse
point cloud from SfM. Subsequently, the density of the Gaussian set is optimized and adaptively
controlled. During optimization, a fast tile-based renderer is employed, allowing competitive training
and inference times compared to the fast NeRF based methods.

3.2
Binocular Stereo Consistency Constraint

The key factor in improving the rendering quality of 3DGS is to guide the Gaussians to be distributed
close to the exact scene surfaces. To this end, we aim to design a constraint on the rendered depth of
3DGS which directly represents the Gaussian geometry. Previous studies commonly adopt the depth
priors from pretrained models to guide the depth of 3DGS. However, the depth priors are often noisy
and blurry, especially for complex scenes, which fails in providing accurate guidance.

In this paper, we propose a novel prior-free method which leverages the binocular stereo consistency
in 3D Gaussian splatting. We constrain on the rendered depth of 3DGS solely obtained by the existing
input views and the novel views rendered by 3DGS. Specifically, we first render a novel view from
a view point which is translated from one of the input views, leading to a pair of binocular vision
images. We then shift the novel view to the perspective of the input image using disparity. Finally, we
constrain the rendered image using the consistency between the input image and the warped image.

Specifically, given an image view Il as input, we translate its corresponding camera position Cl to
the right by a distance dcam and obtain the translational camera position Or. We then obtain a novel
rendered image Ir by rendering 3D Gaussians from Or. The images Il and Ir form a binocular
stereo image pair, where Il is the left image and Ir is the right one, respectively. Simultaneously, we
can obtain the rendered depth Dl corresponding to the left image Il by rendering 3DGS from Ol.
According to the geometric theory of binocular stereo vision, the relationship between disparity d
and depth Dl is given by d = f · dcam/Dl, where d ∈Rh×w and each value dij in d indicates the
horizontal shift required to align a pixel in the right image with its counterpart in the left image. f is
the focal length of the camera. Then, we can use the disparity d to move each pixel of the right image

Ir, obtaining the reconstructed left image Ishifted, as denoted by

Ishifted[i, j] = Ir[i −di, j −dj].
(3)

In practice, to make the reconstructed left image Ishifted differentiable, we use a bilinear sampler to
interpolate on the right image Ir to obtain each pixel of Ishifted. The sampling coordinates for each
pixel are directly obtained from the disparity. Formally, we define the loss function by

Lconsis = 1

(4)

To achieve better optimization with the loss function, we do not use a fixed camera position shift in
practice. Instead, we randomly translate the input camera to the left or right by a distance within a
range [−dmax, dmax] in each iteration.

Although some methods [38, 6, 21] use unseen views or neighboring training views as source views
and warp them to the reference view for consistency constraints, they do not account for the impact of
the distance and angle between the source and reference views on the effectiveness of the supervision.
When the source view is rotated or moved away from the reference view, the warped image suffers
severe distortion due to depth errors and occlusions. Compared to the ground truth (GT) image, this
leads to larger errors, hindering the convergence of the image-warping loss. In contrast, slight camera
translations that cause minor changes in view without rotation and negligible impact from occlusions,
allow the errors between the warped image and the GT image to primarily stem from depth errors,
facilitating better optimization of depth. For the results using different source views, please refer to
the Appendix.

3.3
Opacity Decay Strategy

We further justify that relying solely on the depth constraints does not always lead to correct Gaussian
geometries that are closely aligned with the exact scene surfaces. The reason is that the rendered depth
varies with changes in the scale and opacity of the Gaussians, rather than being solely determined by
their positions. While 3DGS flexibly optimizes the scale and opacity during training, which leads to
deviations in the novel views. To address this issue, we design a simple strategy by applying a decay
coefficient λ to the opacity α of the Gaussians, penalizing the opacity during training.

ˆα = λα, 0 < λ < 1.

Figure 2: Illustration of the Gaussian
opacity decay strategy.

We illustrate the opacity decay strategy in Figure 2. As-
suming all Gaussians are in the initialized state, due to the
accumulation of constraints from multiple views, Gaus-
sians near the scene surface typically have larger opacity
gradients, allowing opacity to rise rapidly and construct
the scene surface. However, some Gaussians far from the
surface fail to get their opacity decreased and be pruned
due to insufficient multiview consistent constraints, even-
tually affecting the rendering quality of novel views.

We aim to improve and stabilize the optimization of 3DGS
by filtering out the far away Gaussians which indicates
incorrect geometry while remain the ones close to the exact
scene surfaces. This is achieved by applying the opacity
decay strategy. We justify that the strategy does not lead
all Gaussians’ opacity going down, such as the ones on
the surface, since these Gaussians’ opacity progressively
increase. As illustrated in Figure 2, the Gaussians far
from the scene surface have lower opacity gradients due
to fewer constraints, meaning their opacity increases less than those of the Gaussians on the scene
surface. Under the opacity decay strategy, the opacity of Gaussians with lower opacity gradients
gradually decreases until they are pruned. Conversely, the increase in opacity for Gaussians near
the scene surface exceeds the decay magnitude, ultimately achieving a balance between the opacity
increase and the decay, thereby preserving Gaussians close to the surface.

Initialization from dense point clouds

Previous 3DGS methods [19, 71, 51] usually utilize a sparse point cloud generated by Structure from
Motion (SfM) [35] to initialize 3D Gaussians. However, the point cloud produced by sparse views is
too sparse to adequately describe the scene to be reconstructed. Although the splitting strategy in
3DGS can replicate new Gaussians to cover the under-reconstructed area, they are subject to limited
geometric constraints and cannot adhere well to the scene surfaces, especially for low-texture areas
where the distribution of Gaussians may be arbitrary. We therefore seek a robust approach to achieve
better geometry initialization for improving 3DGS quality when optimizing from sparse views. Note
that this prior is just used for initialization, and we do not use any this kind of priors during learning
3D Gaussians.

To achieve this, we use a pre-trained keypoints matching network [42] to generate a dense initialization
point cloud. Specifically, we arbitrarily select two images from the input images, input them into
the matching network, and obtain matching points. We then leverage the triangulation method [14],
along with the camera parameters corresponding to these images, to project the matching points into
3D space. This forms a dense point cloud, providing a more robust initialization for the Gaussians.

Compared with the sparse point cloud, the dense point cloud describes the geometry of the scene
more accurately, preventing Gaussians from appearing far from the scene surface and ultimately
leading to improved quality in novel view synthesis.

as introduced in Eq. (4) and the commonly-used color reconstruction loss Lcolor of 3DGS [19]. We
define the overall loss function by

L = Lconsis + Lcolor,

Datasets

We conduct experiments on three public datasets, including the LLFF dataset [27], the DTU dataset
[18] and the NeRF Blender Synthetic dataset (Blender) [28]. Following prior works [30, 54, 17], we
used 3, 6, and 9 views as training sets for the LLFF and DTU datasets, and 8 images for training on the
Blender dataset. The selection of test images remained consistent with previous works [17, 30, 54].
The downsampling rates for the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets are 8, 4, and 2, respectively.

4.2
Implementation details

Since the LLFF and DTU are datasets of forward-facing scenes, they cannot be constrained by views
from other directions during the optimization process. On the other hand, Blender is a dataset of
360-degree scenes, 8 images from different viewpoints are used as input during training, providing

stronger constraints. Therefore, for the LLFF and DTU datasets, we utilize a pre-trained matching
network PDC-Net+ [42] to obtain keypoints from input images, which are then used as the dense
initialization point clouds. For the Blender dataset, we adopt random initialization as in the original
3DGS [19].

Moreover, based on the analysis above, we train
the LLFF and DTU datasets for 30,000 itera-
tions, while the Blender dataset is trained for
7,000 iterations. Since the view consistency con-
straint based on binocular stereo vision needs to
be performed on the basis of the training views
that can already be rendered with high quality,
we add the view consistency loss at 20,000 it-
erations for the LLFF and DTU datasets, and
at 4,000 iterations for the Blender dataset. The
maximum distance dmax for camera shift is set
to 0.4, the opacity decay coefficient λ is set to
0.995, and the β in the loss function 7 is set to
0.2 as in the original 3DGS [19].

SparseNeRF [44], ReconFusion [49] and MuRF [52]. 3DGS-based methods include DNGaussian
[22] and FSGS [71]. Additionally, we compare against the original 3DGS [19].

Comparisons

LLFF.
Table 1 shows the quantitative results of the LLFF dataset with 3, 6, and 9 input views,
respectively. Our method surpasses all baseline methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM [46], and LPIPS
[59] scores under different number of input views. When the number of input views increases to
9, it is almost adequate to provide sufficient color constraints. However, the evaluation scores of
DNGaussian [22] do not show a significant improvement, indicating that it does not perform well
with an increased number of input views. This is because errors in the depth prior negatively affect
the optimization process.

Figure 3 presents the visual comparison of
novel view synthesis and depth rendering for the
leaves and orchids scenes in the LLFF dataset.
From the rendered results of novel views, sev-
eral state-of-the-art methods are all perceptually
acceptable. However, regarding the depth maps,
RegNerf [30], FreeNerf [54], and FSGS [71] ex-
hibit poor quality, indicating significant errors
in their geometric estimation. SparseNeRF [44]
and DNGaussian [22] indirectly utilize relative
depth information from depth priors to supervise
geometry estimation, hence achieving adequate
rendering depth. Although FSGS [71] also ex-
ploits depth priors, it attempts to directly employ
depth prior information by using depth correlation loss. It does not yield accurate scene geometry,
instead, inaccurate depth prior information exacerbates scene geometry. In contrast, our method
utilizes self-supervised view consistency loss to obtain more precise geometry, thereby recovering
more structural details in novel views.

DTU.
Table 2 shows the quantitative results of the DTU dataset under 3, 6, and 9 input views
respectively. MuRF [52] performs better on the DTU dataset when using 3 views as input. However,
generalizable methods require large scale datasets and time-consuming training to learn a prior.
Figure 4 illustrates the visual comparison of novel view synthesis for three scenes in the DTU dataset.

To distinctly discern the differences among various methods, we select the synthesized images far
from the training views for comparison in each scene. From the rendered results of novel views, it
can be observed that NeRF-based methods produce blurry results, while FSGS [71] and DNGaussian
[22] exhibit numerous artifacts due to insufficient constraints on Gaussians. Our method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on most evaluation metrics and achieves better visual quality as
well.

Blender.
We evaluate our method on 360-degree scenes using the Blender dataset. Table 3 presents
the quantitative results under 8 input views. Our approach outperforms all baselines in the PSNR
score, and achieves comparable SSIM and LPIPS. We could not reproduce the results reported in
the FSGS [71] on the Blender dataset and used the own test results in Table 3. Figure 5 illustrates
the visual comparison results of several 3DGS-based methods. It can be observed that FSGS [71]
exhibits noticeable artifacts in the synthesized images due to insufficient Gaussian constraints, and
the rendering results of DNGaussian [22] also has some distortions. In contrast, our method performs
better in terms of detail preservation.

To verify the effectiveness of the view con-
sistency loss, opacity decay strategy and the
dense initialization for Gaussians, we isolate
each of these modules separately while keeping
the other modules unchanged. We then evalu-
ate the metrics and illustrate the visual results.
As shown in Tables 4 and 5, the performance
decreases when removing any of the modules we proposed.

Effectiveness of view consistency loss.
To verify the effectiveness of the view consistency loss,
we compare the depth maps from novel views. Figure 6 shows the visual comparison of rendered
depth maps. The comparison in the figure shows that it is evident that the view consistency loss
significantly improves the estimation of scene geometry.

Effectiveness of opacity decay.
Figure 7 (b) and (c) show the comparison of novel view synthesis
results and the visualization of Gaussian centers for the trex scene in LLFF before and after applying
the opacity decay. It can be seen that without the opacity decay, Gaussians appear far from the
surfaces and there is noise near the surfaces. After applying the opacity decay strategy, the Gaussians
far from the scene surfaces are eliminated, and the noisy point clouds are significantly reduced,
thereby further improving the rendering quality of novel views.

Effectiveness of dense initialization.
Figure 7 (a) and (c) show the novel view images and the final
Gaussian point clouds obtained using different initialization point cloud. It can be seen that without
dense point cloud initialization, the spatial positions of the Gaussians become arbitrary in some
low-texture regions or areas occluded in the training views due to insufficient constraints, resulting in
reduced quality of the novel view images.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel method for novel view synthesis from sparse views with 3DGS. We
construct a self-supervised multi-view consistency constraint using the rendered and input images, and
introduce a Gaussian opacity decay and a dense point cloud initialization strategy. These constraints
ensure that the Gaussians are distributed as closely as possible to the scene surfaces and filter out those
far from the surfaces. Our approach enables the unstructured Gaussians to accurately represent scene
geometry even with sparse input views, resulting in high-quality novel rendering images. Extensive
experiments on the LLFF, DTU and Blender datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art sparse view synthesis methods.

Limitation.
Since our method utilizes the view consistency constraints for estimating scene depth,
some scene areas with low texture may lead to the inaccurate depth estimation (e.g. the white
background areas in the DTU dataset), thus failing to constrain the corresponding Gaussians. This
results in the white Gaussians potentially occluding the object in the novel views. In contrast,
DNGaussian [22] uses the depth prior estimated by the pre-trained network to constrain the Gaussians,
preventing this scenario from happening. The visual comparisons are presented in the Appendix.

Additional Results on DTU

Figure B shows an additional visual comparison between our method and DNGaussian [22] on the

differences between the two methods, we select a novel unseen view that is far from the training
views for comparison. As analyzed in the limitations section of the main text, our method cannot
effectively constrain the white background in training views, resulting in objects being occluded by
white Gaussians in some scenes. Even so, the rendering quality of the novel views from our method
is still better than the results from DNGaussian.

More Experiments

B.1
Entropy regularization instead of Opacity Decay

The Sugar [13] method applies entropy regularization to the opacity of Gaussians to bring Gaussians
closer to the surface, similar to our proposed opacity decay strategy. Therefore, we also evaluate
the performance of opacity entropy regularization on the LLFF dataset. Following Sugar [13], the
opacity threshold for Gaussians pruning is set to 0.5. Table A shows the metrics with opacity entropy
regularization. It can be seen that our opacity decay strategy has advantages. Figure C illustrates
the novel view synthesis using different opacity regularization strategies. It can be seen that entropy
regularization leads to noticeable overfitting with sparse view inputs, resulting in lower quality novel
view rendering.

B.2
Training the DTU with Mask

To eliminate the undesirable effects of the solid color background on novel view rendering results
in the DTU dataset, we perform additional experiments by using masks to filter out the background
in the training views. The evaluation results are shown in Table B. Figure D illustrates the visual
comparison between our method and DNGaussian [22] when using masks in the training views. It
can be seen that without the solid color background, our method shows a significant improvement,
while the performance of DNGaussian decreases.

Ablation studies for hyperparameter λ

We perform ablation studies on the LLFF [27] and DTU [18] datasets with the value of λ ranging
from 0.96 to 1.0, and the results are shown in Table C. We find that the best performance is achieved
when the value of λ is 0.995 on both datasets. Therefore we set λ to 0.995 for all datasets.

Ablation studies for hyperparameter dmax

We perform ablation studies for dmax on the LLFF[27] and DTU [18] datasets. The value of dmax
gradually increases from 0.1 to 0.8, we obtain the results as shown in Table D. We find that there is
almost no performance increase on both the LLFF and DTU datasets when dmax is greater than 0.4,
therefore we set the dmax to 0.4 for all datasets.

D
The impact of initialization on overall performance

We conduct experiments on the LLFF [27] and DTU [18] datasets with several different initialization,
including random initialization, sparse initialization, and using the LoFTR [41] matching network to
construct initial point clouds. The results are shown in Table E.

PDCNet+ [42] can obtain more matching points than LoFTR [41], so the initialized point cloud
obtained by PDCNet+ results in better performance. For the LLFF [27] dataset, the input views have
large overlap, SfM methods can generate point clouds with better quality than LoFTR. Therefore,
using sparse point clouds generated by SfM as initialization yields better performance than LoFTR.
However, for the DTU [18] dataset, where there is small overlap among input views, SfM-generated
point clouds are too sparse. Thus, the performance is even worse than random initialization.

E
The impact of different source views on overall performance

Figure E shows the warped images and error maps when using different source views. It can be
observed that when the source view is rotated relative to the reference view or is far away from
the reference view, the warped image suffers from significant distortions due to depth errors and
occlusions. This results in a large error compared to the GT image.

Implementations Details

Since our method uses an opacity decay strategy, we do not use the opacity reset strategy from the
original 3DGS, and we also remove the scale threshold for Gaussians pruning from the original
3DGS.

We train our model on an RTX 3090 GPU, running 30,000 iterations per scene on the LLFF and DTU
datasets, which takes approximately 10 minutes each. For the Blender dataset, we train for 7,000
iterations per scene, which takes approximately 3 minutes each. The storage space required for the
Gaussian point clouds is about one-third of that required by the original 3DGS.

G
Dataset Details

LLFF.
The LLFF [27] is a forward-facing dataset with 8 scenes. Following previous works [30, 54],
we take every 8th image as the novel views for evaluation. The input views are evenly sampled from
the remaining views. During training and evaluation, the images are downsampled by a factor of 8,
resulting in a resolution of 378×504 for each image.

DTU.
The DTU [18] dataset consists of 124 scenes. We follow previous works [30, 54] to train and
evaluate our method on 15 test scenes. The test scene IDs are: 8, 21, 30, 31, 34, 38, 40, 41, 45, 55,
63, 82, 103, 110, and 114. In each scene, we use images with the following IDs as input views: 25,
22, 28, 40, 44, 48, 0, 8, 13. The first 3 and 6 image IDs correspond to the input views in 3-view and
6-view settings respectively. We use 25 images as novel views for evaluation, with the following IDs:
1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47. During
training and evaluation, the images are downsampled by a factor of 4, resulting in a resolution of 300
× 400 for each image.

Blender.
The Blender [28] dataset consists of 8 synthetic scenes. For fair comparison, we follow
previous works [30, 54] and use 8 images as input views for each scene, with the following IDs:
26, 86, 2, 55, 75, 93, 16, 73, 8. The 25 test views are sampled evenly from the testing images for
evaluation. During training and evaluation, the images are downsampled by a factor of 2, resulting in
a resolution of 400 × 400 for each image.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the contributions and scope of the
paper.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper includes a dedicated "Limitation" paragraph where potential limita-
tions are discussed.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

21


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We clearly describe all the information needed to reproduce the experimental
results in the paper, including our method, hyperparameter values, and datasets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

22


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We use the publicly datasets and provided sufficient instructions on how to
use them for our method in the supplementary materials. The source code will be publicly
available.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We specify hyperparameters in the "Implementation Details" section of the
paper, with any unspecified hyperparameters being the same as the baselines. The supple-
mentary materials include detailed information on data splits.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: We report the average performance in the experimental results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

23


---Page Break---
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the information of GPU resource we used in the supplementary
materials.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our research conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in every respect.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper proposes a method for synthesizing novel view images from sparse
input views. The aim is to observe the objects in the input images from new perspectives.
There is no generation of new or fake data involved.

Guidelines:

24


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper poses no such risks.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We cite the original papers of the code and datasets we used.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

25


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not release new assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

26


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
