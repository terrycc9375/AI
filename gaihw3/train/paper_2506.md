Abstract

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress,
exhibiting great perception and reasoning abilities concerning visual information.
However, when faced with prompts in different sizes of solution spaces, LVLMs
fail to always give consistent answers regarding the same knowledge point. This
inconsistency of answers between different solution spaces is prevalent in LVLMs
and erodes trust. To this end, we provide a multi-modal benchmark ConBench,
to intuitively analyze how LVLMs perform when the solution space of a prompt
revolves around a knowledge point. Based on the ConBench tool, we are the
first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the discriminate
realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the
answers. (2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative
realms: the accuracy of the discriminative question type exhibits a strong positive
correlation with its Consistency with the caption. (3) Compared to open-source
models, closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of
Consistency. Eventually, we ameliorate the consistency of LVLMs by trigger-based
diagnostic refinement, indirectly improving the performance of their caption. We
hope this paper will accelerate the research community in better evaluating their
models and encourage future advancements in the consistency domain.

Introduction

Recently, benefiting from notable advancements in large language models (LLMs) [1; 25; 2], the
realm of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has undergone a revolutionary transformation.
These novel LVLMs [18; 24; 3; 8; 15; 13] try to combine visual signals with textual semantics
and spark cognitive brilliance across modalities. Although LVLMs can generate high-quality re-
sponses to task prompts, we discover that for correctly answered cases, simply modifying the
prompt will result LVLMs in providing contradictory responses. In Figure 1 (a.2), LLaVA-7B
[18] properly describes the picture as “It is a man wearing a dinosaur costume.”, but
when prompted “Is the dinosaur played by humans? Please answer yes or no.”, it re-
sponds with “No, they are dinosaurs”. The above phenomenon of Inconsistency is widely
observed across mainstream LVLMs, and a preliminary study was conducted only on LLMs [14]. In
practice, in contrast to the fixed patterns of questions, designed in existing multimodal benchmarks,
the users tend to pose questions in arbitrary ways. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the LVLMs in
predicting correct and consistent answers, even when faced with various formats of queries.

Figure 1: Here is the overview of our paper. Part (a) indicates two examples of Inconsistency
between discriminative answers and generative captions, where the answers marked in blue contradict
the answers marked in purple. Part (b) shows the Consistency evaluation method Conbench and its
discriminative top three leaderboard. Part(c) reveals the main three findings built upon ConBench.

However, there are currently no benchmarks or research studies that specifically focus on evaluating
the Consistency of LVLMs responses. These single-prompt type evaluation approaches [12; 10; 28;
21; 6] lead to a disconnect between benchmark accuracy and real-world user practical experience.

Based on the above observations, we systematically introduce a Consistency Benchmark dubbed
ConBench, to estimate the capabilities of LVLMs more thoroughly via diverse question formats. It
consists of 1, 000 public pictures, and each was manually selected from four multimodal benchmarks
[10; 12; 28; 21]. Apart from the original discriminative prompt, we constructed two additional
discriminative types of questions3 by ChatGPT/GPT-4 [1]. Notably, three types of questions of
each case are around the same knowledge point. Besides, every set is accompanied by a generative
question without ground truth. Consequently, ConBench serves as an evaluation tool that observes
the Consistency performance of LVLMs and surpasses the limitations of previous assessments.

Furthermore, grounded on the ConBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis and visualization of
Consistency on 14 popular LVLMs. In a nutshell, the conclusions of noteworthy insight are threefold:

C1 In the discriminative question-answering (QA) domain: (1) A decrease in LVLMs accuracy as
the prompt’s solution space increases. (2) Instances of erroneous yet consistent answers are scarce.

C2 Extended to the generative domain, we establish a connection between discriminative and
generative domains by the perspective of Consistency. (1) As the solution space of discriminative
questions expands, the Consistency between its answer and caption grows stronger. (2) The accuracy
of discriminative answer and its Consistency with the caption exhibit a positive correlation.

C3 Closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of Consistency, compared to
open-source models. This provides an alternative perspective to demonstrate why closed-source mod-
els, despite sometimes having lower accuracy, offer a better user experience in practical applications.

Eventually, leveraging the insights gained from our theoretical discoveries, we enhance the caption
performance of LVLMs without any additional costs associated with training. Specifically, we
construct discriminative prompts based on the low-confidence words in the answers of LVLMs,
forcing the LVLMs to introspect. Then, through iterative refinement in multiple rounds of question-
answering, the quality of LVLMs’ captions gets an impressive achievement (e.g., our method improves
the LLaVA-NeXT-34B [19] by 9.1% and MiniGemini-34B [15] by 9.6% on metric[C] in Sec. 3.4).

In summary, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a Consistency evaluation method
and conduct a comprehensive analysis of Inconsistency in LVLMs. We hope this paper serves as a
catalyst for further exploration, and look forward to the community applying the above findings to
polish up the usability and practicality of large vision-language models.

3e.g., Multiple-choice questions and limited VQA questions are generated for MME benchmark.

Related Work

Large Vison Language Models
With the impressive success of large language models (LLMs)
[1; 25; 2; 4; 29], recent studies work on generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) [18;
24; 3; 8; 15; 27] to improve multimodal comprehension and generation through utilizing the strong
generality of LLMs. Built upon the CLIP [23] image encoder which is somewhat aligned with the
language modality, current LVLMs typically utilize vast image-text pairs to connect the vision encoder
and LLM, enabling LLM to receive and understand visual content. For instance, LLaVA [20] directly
connects the vision encoder and LLM with MLPs, showing proficiency in multi-modal dialogues.
Subsequent works have further enhanced LVLMs by improving the multi-modal instruction data
[18; 27; 5] and designing novel modules [3; 4; 26] for more sufficient modality alignment.

Conventional Multimodal Evaluation
A multitude of public multimodal benchmarks, such as
MME [10], SeedBench [12], and MMBench [21], further advance objective evaluation of LVLMs by
only constructing True/False questions or multiple-choice questions, where the absence of diverse
question types causes instability. In addition, their objective metrics solely emphasize the LVLM’s
accuracy, disregarding its robustness and security. The above issues can lead to a situation where
some LVLMs have lower accuracy in evaluation results but provide a better user experience. To
systematically assess the comprehensive capability of LVLMs, we propose a simple and efficient
evaluation approach that relies on checking the Consistency between different kinds of prompts.

Inconsistency in LLMs
A amount of prior work has been conducted on investigating Inconsistency
in LLMs. [14] is the first to find the Inconsistency phenomenon in question-answering and validator
tasks and define GV-consistency. Besides, it leverages consistency pair for training to improve LLMs’
performance. While [17] utilizes Consistency to check for hallucination detection in LLMs, a logic
consistency-based method that involves logic-related questions and answers. Compared to LLMs,
Inconsistency in LVLMs is more likely to occur due to the additional visual modality, which deserves
further exploration.

Figure 2: Overview of 19 evaluation de-
tailed categories in ConBench.

We propose a novel multimodal evaluation pipeline
named ConBench to comprehensively assess LVLMs.
The ConBench has a total of 4K questions on 1K
images and corresponding 3K discriminative ground
truths, guaranteeing evaluation quality in terms of
the quantity and diversity of questions. In Sec. 3.1,
we present the generation of ConBench and the con-
struction pipeline for prompts. Sec. 3.2 introduces
the hierarchical core capabilities and discusses the
design philosophy. Sec. 3.3 and 3.4 describe the eval-
uation strategy for scoring various types of answers.

3.1
Data Generation Process

Image Filter
We manually chose 1K images from four high-quality multimodal benchmarks: MME
[10], SeedBench [12], MMBench [21], and MMMU [28]. MME is a true/false question type, while
SeedBench and MMBench cover comprehensive multiple-choice questions. Meanwhile, MMMU
emphasizes the knowledge level. The criteria for the image filter include: (1) resolution is more
than 224 × 224 (2) the image rarely occurs in the mainstream training dataset (e.g., COCO [16] and
Cityscapes [9]) (3) There are more than 3 foreground objects in the image. The above criteria ensure
the quality of content in images.
Prompt Construction
Each image is accompanied by its original discriminative prompt, and we
constructed two extra discriminative questions. Therefore, a case owns three discriminative prompts
(true/false, multiple-choice and limited VQA questions) with a generative caption prompt around
the same knowledge point. Firstly, we modified the original prompts whose answers can be directly
inferred from the text instead of the image, to force LVLMs to utilize information from the visual
features. Next, we employed GPT/GPT-4 to generate the extra discriminative types of questions,

3


---Page Break---
which were then subjected to the manual review, and the proposed prompt is listed in Figure 3. Finally,
to avoid bias in the LVLMs that may affect the evaluation results, the true/false questions have a 50%
distribution for both correct and wrong ground truths. For the multiple-choice questions, each option
(e.g., A, B, C, D) has an equal probability distribution of 25% for being the correct answer. Notably,
to ensure an accurate evaluation parser, limited VQA questions are subject to certain restrictions, like
specifying the word count and answer format (e.g., fractions / abbreviations / numbers).

3.2
Hierarchical Core Capabilities

The ConBench comprises three core capabilities, arranged in ascending order of difficulty, namely:
Sensation, Cognition, and Knowledge, with nineteen fine-grained dimensions shown in Figure 2.

“Prompt Construction” Prompt :
You are a question expert. Give you a [Discriminative type] 
question, and you should generate two other kinds questions. 
The [Discriminative type] question is that [Original Prompt].
Based on the [Discriminative type] question above, a [The 
other discriminative type] about the [Category] with 
following answer, and a VQA question about [Category] with 
following answer are generated for the same knowledge point. 
Figure 3: The prompt for generation of dis-
criminative questions. Please zoom in to view.

[Easy Mode] Sensation: What you see is what
you get. We assume that sensation is the most fun-
damental expertise of LVLMs, and it is the "eye"
of the LLMs. While perceived questions appear
simple and basic, they are nonetheless essential.
Therefore, this capability accounts for 50% of the
ConBench. Count, color, optical character recog-
nition (OCR) and scene categories focus on subtle
details, while poster, attribute recognition and po-
sition types emphasize the overall picture.

[Medium Mode] Cognition: Go beyond the surface. The cognitive process needs the model to
integrate visual and language modalities: observing the content of an image, combining it with the
text of question, and retrieving knowledge from within the LLMs. It is more challenging than the
single sensation task. This section constitutes 26% of the ConBench, including numerical calculation,
code inference, text translation, math, cross-instance reasoning and attribute reasoning categories.

[Hard Mode] Knowledge: Master the art of synthesis and integration. Mastering professional
knowledge is an essential pathway for next-generation LVLMs to become Expert AGI, as it requires
a higher level of understanding of images and the application of expert knowledge. We carefully
selected knowledge from diverse and extensive fields, such as celebrities, chemistry, physics, biology,
art and geography. This part takes up 24% of the total, and functions as the upper limit of ConBench.

3.3
Results Parser

For true/false questions, we first extract the "yes" and "no" from the answer. If both of them are
absent, the answer would be considered as "none". Then, we strictly compare the extracted answer
with the ground truth. If they match exactly, the true/false response is considered correct.

When parsing the outcome of multiple choices, we derive the choice label (e.g., A, B, C, D) from it.
If successful, utilize this as the prediction and match the ground truth. If not, we will not proceed
with further extracting the answers. Because in each prompt of choices, we specified that only one
letter needs to be answered. Doing so would be unfair to LVLMs that excel in following instructions.

We still utilize character matching for the answer of limited VQA instead of GPTs. On one hand, we
have taken strict formatting constraints on the prompts. For instance, in physics and math, there are
restrictions on answering with fractions (e.g., 1/2), while in geography at the city level. On the other
hand, the cost of the GPT’s judgment is high and the waiting time is delayed. Specifically, the parser
is based on the Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) [22], where the threshold τ is
set to 0.95 and M = N = 1. When parsed result s > 0.4, we consider the answer to be exactly right.

3.4
Multidimensional Evaluation Metric

Here we provide two evaluation metrics, each from the perspective of discriminative and generative
domains, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of LVLMs consistency. The former
does not rely on AI tools and quickly produces Consistency results among discriminative responses
via Sec. 3.3, primarily evaluating the knowledge. The latter employs GPT to indirectly assess the
quality of captions, by judging the consistency between discriminative responses and captions.

Discriminative Domain Evaluation Metric We define the ConScore[D] as that: when all three
discriminative types of questions within the same case are answered correctly, the model gets one
point. The maximum score is 1000 points. The final format is presented as a percentage (%).

Generative Domain Evaluation Metric Due to the high variability in captions, it is not possible
to calculate Consistency based on character matching alone. Therefore, we rely on GPT/GPT4 for
judgment. The judging process and the constructed prompts are shown in Figure 4. We formulate
it as a machine reading comprehension task. We manually sample the judgment results, and GPT4
achieved an accuracy rate of 95%, which is reliable and trustworthy. Next, we define the ConScore[C]
as the average score of Consistency between the caption and the other three discriminative responses.

of 1.3%. The InternVL-v1.2P-40B [8] performs best in the open-sourced community, especially in
cognition capability. The LLaVA series did not make it to the top ten. In the metric[C], the newest
GPT4-Omni [1] leads the leaderboard, which is the only model that surpasses 60. It has a significant
advantage over the second-place model Qwen-VL-Max [3], with a gap of 3.8. We observed that
although the GPT series slightly underperforms Qwen-Max in metric[D], it significantly outperforms
the Qwen series in metric[C], which aligns with our actual user experience. Actually, ConScore[C]
provides an alternative quality description of captions, because higher recall and precision rates
usually match better Consistency. Besides, rankings of LVLMs show a slight variation between
metric[C] and metric[D]. The GPT series models claim better performance of caption generation.

To investigate what causes the Inconsis-
tency between different types of prompts,
we first conduct analyses on the discrimi-
native domain to compare the performance
differences. We summarize our findings
into the following facts:
Fact 4.2.1 (Inconsistency in Accuracy).
The accuracy of the answer decreases as
the solution space of the discriminative
prompt increases.

As shown in the columns of "T", "C", and
"V" in Table 1, the accuracy decreases as
the solution space expands in all core capa-
bilities. For instance (e.g., the Sensation of
GPT-4-Omni), the double-choice true-false questions achieve an accuracy of 89.2, whereas the accu-
racy for multiple-choice and VQA questions on the same case declines to 79.4 and 61.7, respectively.
This is understandable, as the number of potential choices increases, the difficulty in identifying the
correct answer also rises.

Fact 4.2.2 (Inconsistency in Wrong Answers). Cases of erroneous yet consistent answers are scarce.

Figure 6: Visualization of the relationship between the correct rate of discriminative answer and its
Consistency with the caption on different answer types.

We analyze the answers that fail in all three question types and find that, despite all resulting in
incorrect predictions, they do not demonstrate a consistent understanding of the same images, leading
to distinct answers. For example, we calculated the proportion of consistent incorrect responses in
VQA and multiple-choice questions. We found a very small consistency, and it did not exceed 0.50%
across the entire benchmark. This indicates that the models struggle to interpret the visual content
uniformly, revealing significant variability in their failure modes.

Fact 4.2.3 (Inconsistency in Confidence). The confidence of models in their answers reveals signs of
inconsistent and incorrect predictions.

Taking Fact 4.2.1 and Fact 4.2.2 into account, we perform a deeper analysis of the model’s predictions
by measuring their confidence in the answers. We use the predicted probabilities and logits of the
answer tokens to represent confidence (see Appendix B for details). As summarized in Figure 5, we
measure the average probabilities and logits of the correct and incorrect answers4, respectively. The
three types of questions share similar confidence levels for the correct answers. However, for the
incorrect answers, their confidence levels vary significantly with a clear trend: the larger the solution
space, the smaller the confidence. This analysis provides crucial insights for our method in enhancing
the consistency and accuracy of LVLMs, which we will further discuss in Sec. 5.

4.3
Generative Domain

Next, we extend our attention to the generative domain. Based on Consistency, we first build a bridge
between the discriminative and generative domains. We consolidate our findings as the below facts:

Fact 4.3.1 (Inconsistency to Generative Answers). As the solution space of discriminative questions
increases, the Consistency between their answers and generative answers increases.

As indicated in the last column of Table 2, “Ordered” means Con[T] < Con[C] < Con[V]. The
answers of all closed-source models and most open-source models adhere to this pattern. Here is the
theoretical explanation. Assume the distribution for the generative domain (Caption) is S, and the
sample space of S is W. For the discriminative domain, the sample space is limited to W ′, which
only contains some candidates from W. Assume the model handles the discriminative domain by
creating another distribution S′ according to S and W ′. Then the total variation distance (TVD) [11]

4MGM_Y and LLaVA_Y mean the correct, while MGM_N and LLaVA_N represent the wrong.

between S and S′ is
1
2 ∥S −S′∥1 .
(1)

This becomes larger when |W \ W ′| becomes larger. For instance, if the model creates S′ by simply
doing reject sampling5, then
1
2 ∥S −S′∥1 = Pr[S ∈W \ W ′].
(2)

It is obvious that when W ′ is more ”different” from W, the distance will be larger.
Fact 4.3.2 (Connection between Discriminative and Generative Domain). The accuracy of the
discriminative answer exhibits a strong positive correlation with its Consistency with the generative.

As shown in Figure 6 and 7, we conduct visualizations for all tested LVLMs: The vertical axis repre-
sents the accuracy of their discriminative answers, while the horizontal axis represents the consistency
of the answers with caption. Figure 6 displays the distribution across different question types, while
Figure 7 illustrates the distribution across different core capabilities. The green lines represent a fitted
linear equation. Additionally, we utilize the Pearson coefficient P[X, Y ] to quantitatively analyze the
degree of linear correlation, and the 6 coefficients in the above figures are all more than 0.85.

4.4
Consistency Bias

Fact 4.4.1 (Consistency Bias). Closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage on
Consistency, compared to open-source models.

When we fit a linear regression to all evaluated models and get the green line in Figure 6 (a):

L1 : y = kx + b,
(3)

where x is the accuracy, and y means Consistency between its answer and caption. We found that the
majority of open-source models lie below this line, while closed-source models lie above it. In other
words, at the same level of accuracy, the responses from closed-source models tend to exhibit better
consistency with their captions. So we fit a linear regression to closed-source models and get the red
line. The line they reside on has a higher bias bc (e.g., bc −b = 3.24 in Figure 6 (a)), which aligns
with our experience where closed-source models provide more comprehensive and reliable answers.

5
Trigger-based Diagnostic Refinement

In light of the previous findings, we summarize two key insights: (1) LVLMs exhibit higher accuracy
when operating within a narrower discriminative solution space; (2) Incorrect answers are usually
associated with significantly lower confidence and logits. Consequently, we propose a simple but
efficient method dubbed Trigger-based Diagnostic Refinement (TDR) to ameliorate the generation
skill of LVLMs without any additional training. The proposed pipeline is presented in Figure 8.

Refinement pipeline.

Method We start by making the LVLM generate a
caption, with each word accompanied by its corre-
sponding probability. Next, uninformative words are
dropped based on their parts of speech, and we only
keep nouns, adjectives and quantifiers. When the re-
maining words with probabilities below a threshold
τ (we set τ = 0.85 here), trigger subsequent diagnos-
tic processes. Since low probabilities of words indi-
cate a lack of confidence, we formulate True/False
discriminative questions to force the LVLM to self-
verify (e.g., Is there {cat} in the picture?).
The self-diagnostic prompt and its response will be
drafted into a new prompt, which is fed back into the
LVLM to generate a higher-quality caption.

Results We carried out experiments on the LLaVA-
NeXT-34B and MiniGemini-34B and evaluated them
on the metric[C] of ConBench. The experimental re-
sults are detailed in Table 4. Notably, the LLaVA-
NeXT-34B sees an improvement of 9.1 points, while
the MiniGemini experiences an overall enhancement of 9.6 points. Although our approach primarily
employs True/False questions for self-verify, there is still a noticeable improvement in ConScore[C].
Hence, our method effectively boosts the quality of captions by triggering the model to self-check.

In theory, we can further construct multiple discriminative questions for the caption, enabling the
model to verify multiple elements within the caption. Additionally, the process can be iterated
multiple rounds, leading to ongoing enhancements in the quality of the generated output. Our method
is a simplified implementation of the above approaches.

Conclusion

In this study, we investigate the Consistency issues in large vision-language models (LVLMs).
Consistency reflects the overall ability of LVLMs, as it not only requires LVLMs to provide correct
answers but also demands sufficient confidence in their knowledge point, regardless of the type of
question encountered. We first introduce the ConBench, a benchmark that fills the gap in assessing
Consistency. It includes 1K images with 4K prompts and two evaluation metrics: ConScore[D] and
ConScore[C]. Then, our findings shed light on the nature of Consistency in LVLMs according to the
ConBench. We observe that as the solution space of a prompt increases, the accuracy of the answers
tends to decrease. Besides, we establish a relationship between the discriminative and generative
realms, highlighting the importance of Consistency between the discriminative answer and caption.
Furthermore, we discover that closed-source models exhibit a bias advantage over open-source
models in terms of consistency. Finally, we propose a solution by forcing LVLMs to self-think, where
a discriminative prompt is constructed via uncertain words in the caption. Our method makes the
quality of LVLMs’ captions an impressive achievement. We believe that our research contributes to
the evaluation of LVLMs and encourages future advancements for achieving Consistency in LVLMs.

a casual white t-shirt, and his focus is evident as he strums the strings. The stage is set against a
backdrop of a colorful banner that proudly proclaims "DOWNTOWN 5". The banner’s bold colors
contrast with the musician’s white t-shirt, drawing attention to both the performer and the event. The
stage is equipped with various musical instruments, including a drum set and a keyboard, suggesting
a full band performance. A microphone stands ready, capturing the musician’s performance for
the audience. The stage is situated in a space that appears to be partially open to the elements, as
suggested by the presence of a roof structure in the background. This setup indicates that the concert
is being held in a venue that can accommodate outdoor or semi-outdoor performances, adding a
unique ambiance to the event. Overall, the image portrays a dynamic and engaging live music event,
with the musician at the heart of the performance, surrounded by his instruments.

B
Computation for Probabilities and Logits

For each model (MGM-13B and LLaVA-13B), we randomly selected 50 consistent and 50 inconsistent
samples, respectively. The JSON samples are in support materials. To measure the LVLMs’ response
confidence accurately, we manually simplified the answers and maintained the words that are the
most critical to the judgment. The specific principles are as listed:

For true/false questions, we only keep the word ’yes’ or ’no’ and their probabilities.

e.g., [Yes], there is a cat.

For multiple-choice questions, we only keep the choice labels (e.g., A, B, C, D) and their probabilities.

12


---Page Break---
e.g., ([A]) Cats.

For limited VQA questions, we manually picked out keywords that matched ground truth from the
answers, and computed the average probabilities of them as the final probability.

e.g., A [Cat] walks on the street.

C
Limitations

The introduced ConBench offers a new perspective on evaluating model performance through the
consistency between multiple types of questions, providing a more comprehensive measurement and
understanding of existing LVLMs. However, due to the distinct response forms of captions, assessing
the consistency between captions and discriminative answers is judged by GPT, posing a risk of
inaccurate evaluations. Besides, by delving deeper into our benchmark analysis, we propose trigger-
based diagnostic refinement to improve the consistency and accuracy of LVLMs. This, however,
introduces additional computational costs and is limited by the inherent capabilities of the LVLMs.
Further improvements can be achieved by designing and training LVLMs with a focus on consistency.

D
Broader Impacts

Overall, this research has broader impacts on the evaluation, performance, fairness, and future
development of LVLMs, fostering progress and advancements in the field of vision-language models.

Advancing Evaluation: The introduction of ConBench, a benchmark for assessing Consistency in
LVLMs, fills a crucial gap in the evaluation of these models. This benchmark provides a standardized
framework for measuring the performance and reliability of LVLMs across different prompts.

Novel Insights: we are the first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the
discriminate realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the answers.
(2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative realms. (3) Compared to
open-source models, closed-source models exhibit a bias advantage in terms of Consistency.

Inspiring Future Research: By contributing to the evaluation and understanding of Consistency in
LVLMs, this research paves the way for future advancements in the field. It encourages researchers
to explore new techniques, methodologies, and approaches to achieve higher levels of Consistency in
LVLMs, ultimately pushing the boundaries of language and vision understanding.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope, including a benchmark, three main analyses and a method
to improve the caption of LVLMs.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We point out our limitations of the work in Appendix C.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

17


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our paper releases a dataset and evaluation method, and the experimental
results are reproducible.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

18


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release the dataset and evaluation code after the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our paper only includes LVLMs evaluation and specifies all the test details.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We investigate the robustness of our results in Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

19


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The evaluation in our paper only needs an A100-80GB GPU.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work in Appendix D.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

20


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper re-packages the public datasets, and provides both the original
license and the license of the derived asset.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

21


---Page Break---
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The paper introduces a new benchmark, and we created an anonymized URL
in Appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
