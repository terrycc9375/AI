Abstract

Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently attracted considerable attention
due to its broad applications in autonomous driving and robotics, which aims
to effectively recognize novel classes in previously unseen domains. However,
existing point cloud-based open-vocabulary 3D detection models are limited by
their high deployment costs. In this work, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed OVM3D-Det, which trains
detectors using only RGB images, making it both cost-effective and scalable
to publicly available data. Unlike traditional methods, OVM3D-Det does not
require high-precision LiDAR or 3D sensor data for either input or generating
3D bounding boxes. Instead, it employs open-vocabulary 2D models and pseudo-
LiDAR to automatically label 3D objects in RGB images, fostering the learning
of open-vocabulary monocular 3D detectors. However, training 3D models with
labels directly derived from pseudo-LiDAR is inadequate due to imprecise boxes
estimated from noisy point clouds and severely occluded objects. To address these
issues, we introduce two innovative designs: adaptive pseudo-LiDAR erosion and
bounding box refinement with prior knowledge from large language models. These
techniques effectively calibrate the 3D labels and enable RGB-only training for 3D
detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OVM3D-Det over
baselines in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The code will be released.

Introduction

3D object detection has attracted substantial attention in recent years due to its broad applications in
fields such as autonomous driving [13, 25, 26, 64, 55, 31], augmented reality [17, 15, 22], embodied
AI [41, 7, 73, 61], etc. Although many 3D detectors [42, 62, 51, 35, 32, 48, 50] have marked their
impressive performance in the course of 3D perception development and consistently renew the state-
of-the-art records on the popular benchmarks [14, 10, 52], they often struggle to generalize to other
object categories beyond their training data, severely limiting their applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. To address this challenge, many previous works [30, 6, 59, 76, 71, 75] have taken steps
forward to detect open-vocabulary objects in broader scenarios, i.e., focusing on identifying and
localizing the objects that do not belong to the known categories during training.

However, these open-vocabulary 3D detectors rely heavily on point clouds captured from high-
precision LiDARs or 3D sensors, which are expensive to deploy. On the contrary, in another line of
research, monocular 3D object detectors directly take in single-view images to localize and recognize

Figure 1: Comparison between point cloud-based and image-based open-vocabulary 3D object
detection methods. During training, point cloud-based approaches require corresponding point cloud
and image data to derive pseudo labels, while image-based methods can leverage large-scale image
data and the most advanced depth estimation models for pseudo-label generation. During inference,
point cloud-based methods necessitate expensive LiDAR or other 3D sensors for deployment, whereas
image-based approaches only require a camera.

3D bounding boxes of the targets. Without the costly acquisition of point clouds, monocular 3D
detectors broaden the horizon of deploying object detection models on more economical platforms [33,
9, 4, 29, 44]. Even though the monocular approaches have liberated 3D object detection from the
expensive point clouds during inference, their training procedure still requires images and LiDAR
or 3D sensor data pairs in the intensive labeling process, preventing further data scaling. Given the
abundance of RGB images online, one might ask: Could the training of monocular 3D detectors
benefit from the readily available RGB images to improve the open-vocabulary perception capability?

In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a novel open-vocabulary monocular 3D object
detection framework named OVM3D-Det, which requires only RGB images for training, enables the
exploitation of a diverse array of data, and fosters its open-vocabulary potential upon deployment,
as shown in Fig. 1. To excavate valuable knowledge and explore the open-set objects from large
amounts of images, we harness open-vocabulary 2D models to find the objects that belong to the novel
categories. In order to obtain their corresponding 3D bounding boxes, we adopt pseudo-LiDAR [57]
assisted with depth estimator to determine the location of the objects in 3D spaces.

Nevertheless, a naive implementation of this framework leads to inaccurate 3D bounding boxes, im-
pairing the performance of trained open-vocabulary 3D detectors (see Tab. 5(a), 7.3% vs. 18.5% AP).
We attribute this to the highly noisy pseudo-LiDAR. Although recent advances in depth estimation
models [16, 67, 40, 56, 65] showcase impressive zero-shot generalization across various structured
environments and cameras with different intrinsics, pseudo-LiDAR can accumulate errors during
the auto-labeling process: (1) the generated point clouds are noisy, making it difficult to distinguish
targets from background artifacts (see Fig. 2); (2) target objects may be occluded whose actual sizes
are hard to estimate, as the point clouds are projected from a single view.

Facing these challenges, we design two innovative components in our OVM3D-Det framework. In
order to mitigate the first issue, we propose an adaptive erosion method to filter artifacts in pseudo-
LiDAR and reserve the target objects. This method adaptively removes noise points close to targets
according to the object size, thereby improving the precision of 3D bounding boxes. For the second
issue, if most points of the objects are missing, accurately estimating their dimensions is challenging.
We introduce prior knowledge of objects in each category by prompting large language models such
as GPT-4 [1] to determine reasonable bounding boxes and devise a bounding box search technique
to optimize the unreasonable box. Finally, the open-vocabulary monocular 3D object detectors are
trained to localize with the pseudo bounding boxes and to recognize by aligning with text embeddings.

In summary, the contributions of our paper are threefold: (1) We present the first work targeting
image-based open-vocabulary 3D detection tasks across both indoor and outdoor scenarios; (2)
We introduce a framework, OVM3D-Det, that automatically labels 3D objects without relying on
LiDAR point clouds, thereby expanding the capability to utilize internet-scale data; (3) Our proposed
detector, trained on auto-labeled pseudo targets, significantly outperforms the baselines, showcasing
the effectiveness of our approach.

Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in 3D open-
vocabulary scene understanding. This emerging field takes advantage of the zero-shot recognition
capabilities of 2D vision-language models [20, 45], enabling the generalization to objects belonging
to new classes [8, 11, 19, 39, 53, 70, 23]. In this context, several works [30, 6, 59, 12, 71, 75] explore
open-vocabulary 3D object detection, targeting novel object identification. OV-3DET [30] introduces
triplet cross-modal contrastive learning to link image, point cloud, and text modalities, allowing
the point cloud detector to leverage vision-language pre-trained models [45]. CODA [6] trains a
class-agnostic 3D detector on annotated base categories, gradually discovering novel objects and
incorporating them into the training labels. However, previous methods require point clouds as input
with high deployment costs, while we focus on open-vocabulary monocular 3D object detection.

Monocular 3D Object Detection. Monocular 3D object detection aims to predict 3D bounding boxes
and object classes from a single image, which is challenging due to the loss of depth information
when converting 3D to 2D. Previous works [33, 9, 4, 29, 74, 44, 63, 37, 72] leverage additional
prior information, such as geometric constraints or ground depth, to enhance performance. Pseudo-
LiDAR [43, 57, 58, 68] generates pseudo LiDAR points with the off-the-shelf depth estimator and
then employs the LiDAR-based 3D detector. Cube R-CNN [3] improves the model’s generalization
across datasets by utilizing virtual depth, transforming object depth with consistent virtual camera
intrinsics. While these methods have yielded impressive results, they all require manually labeled
3D annotations for model training. To reduce the labor-intensive 3D data labeling process, some
works [38, 18, 54] have explored weakly-supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection.
Although these approaches eliminate the need for 3D annotations, they still require raw LiDAR data.
In [21], to address the lack of 3D annotations, they use an off-the-shelf depth estimator to enhance
3D localization, transferring this information to 3D detectors through self-knowledge distillation.
However, with the depth estimation model being pre-trained on the same dataset used for 3D detection,
the generalization ability of this method cannot be guaranteed. Different from weakly-supervised
methods, we seek to ease the burden of expensive 3D data acquisition, enabling the massive image
data and increasing the model’s open-vocabulary ability.

Depth Estimation Model. Reconstructing depth from monocular RGB image is an ill-posed
problem [68, 36]. MiDaS [46] introduces an affine-invariant target to ignore the varying depth scales
and shifts across different datasets, estimating the relative depth. Recently, the achievements of
visual foundation models [34, 24] trained on large-scale datasets have encouraged the development
of various foundational depth estimation models [16, 67, 40, 56, 65]. Depth Anything[65] scales up
to a large volume of unlabeled data, significantly expanding data coverage and thereby improving
generalization. Metric3D [67] points out that the key to generalization lies in addressing the metric
ambiguity of different camera models and proposes a canonical camera space transformation to
handle the scale ambiguity problem. Unidepth [40] designs a camera module that generates dense
camera representations to guide the depth prediction module, allowing it to zero-shot predict depth
for a given image. The tremendous progress of these depth estimation models lays the foundation for
generating practical pseudo-LiDAR in our method.

Method

Our goal is to train an open-vocabulary monocular 3D model in an unsupervised manner using image
data, without the need for LiDAR point clouds. To achieve this, we propose an automatic labeling
framework, OVM3D-Det, that generates 3D labels for RGB images. OVM3D-Det initially generates
per-instance depth maps and unprojects them into pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. It subsequently
post-processes the instance-level pseudo-LiDAR data to remove artifacts and noises (Sec. 3.1). Then,
we fit a 3D bounding box closely to the refined pseudo-LiDAR and employ object priors to evaluate
the box; if it is considered unreasonable, we search for the optimal box. (Sec. 3.2). Finally, we train a
Cube R-CNN model on the auto-labeled data (Sec. 3.3). The overall framework is illustrated in Fig. 3.

3.1
Generate Pseudo-LiDAR

Pseudo-LiDAR Generation. For a given image, we begin with using the off-the-shelf Grounded-
SAM [47] to detect and segment novel objects. Grounded-SAM integrates Grounding DINO [28]
as an open-set object detector, combined with the segment anything model (SAM) [24], enabling
simultaneous detection and segmentation of regions within images using arbitrary text inputs. After
querying Grounded-SAM with a text list of novel objects of interest, we derive bounding boxes
{Bk}K
k=1 and corresponding masks {Mk}K
k=1 for all the objects of interest in the image, where K
denotes the number of detected objects. Then we use the pre-trained monocular deep estimation model
Unidepth [40] to predict its depth map D(u, v). Note that we directly employ the pre-trained model
for zero-shot estimation, and there is no overlap between the datasets used in our experiments and the
training datasets of the pre-trained model. This ensures that our method has strong generalizability.
Following [57], we can obtain the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of each pixel (u, v) within the camera’s
coordinate system:

4


---Page Break---
z = D(u, v)
x = (u −cU) × z/fU
y = (v −cV ) × z/fV

(1)

Here, (cU, cV ) denotes the pixel coordinates corresponding to the camera center, while fU and fV
represent the horizontal and vertical focal lengths, respectively. For each mask Mi, applying eq. (1)
to all pixels within the mask yields a 3D point cloud
 
x(n), y(n), z(n)	Ni
n=1 representing the object,
where Ni denotes the total pixel count of the mask Mi. The resulting point cloud is referred to as
pseudo-LiDAR.

Adaptive Pseudo-LiDAR Erosion. We visualize the pseudo-LiDAR and observe that, while it is
generally impressive, it still exhibits considerable noise, making it challenging to directly obtain
accurate 3D bounding boxes from it. As shown in Fig. 2, compared to LiDAR data, pseudo-LiDAR
is denser but also noisier. We identify that the primary source of inaccuracy in pseudo-LiDAR stems
from projection errors at the edges of predicted masks. This issue arises because foreground objects
and the background, which may have large disparities in depth values, can appear closely adjacent
in images, thereby complicating depth estimation at object boundaries. Therefore, we propose
employing the image erosion operation to eliminate inaccurate object mask edges while preserving
other regions. Image erosion is the morphological operation in digital image processing. Despite
its simplicity, the erosion procedure effectively reduces noise, resulting in a cleaner pseudo-LiDAR
representation. As shown in Fig. 3(b), after eroding the edges of the car’s mask, the pseudo-LiDAR of
the car no longer contains noise at the top and front of the vehicle. Please refer to Sec. C for details.

On the other hand, we note that aggressive erosion may completely remove small objects like distant
pedestrians, while mild erosion may leave considerable noise on large objects. Hence, we introduce an
adaptive erosion module to address this issue. Specifically, this module adjusts the erosion technique
based on the Grounding-SAM-generated mask size in the RGB image. Specifically, small objects
will undergo less erosion, preserving more of their area, while larger objects will have more of their
edges removed, ensuring more accurate pseudo-LiDAR.

3.2
Generate Pseudo 3D Bounding Boxes

Box Orientation Estimation. Building upon the refined pseudo-LiDAR, we generate 3D bound-
ing boxes as pseudo-labels to equip our monocular 3D object detection model with localization
capabilities. Without losing generality, we assume that the 3D bounding boxes of objects in the
scene are parallel to the ground. To generate such boxes, we begin by estimating the ground plane
equation in the camera coordinate system C. The same method as in Sec. 3.1 is used to generate the
pseudo-LiDAR for the ground. Specifically, Grounded-SAM [47] is prompted with “ground” for
outdoor scenes or “floor” for indoor scenes to obtain their masks. We back-project these masks into
3D space using the estimated depth, and apply the least squares method to fit these points and derive
the equation representing the ground. Then, the pseudo-LiDAR is transformed to the new coordinate
system C′ where the origin aligns with that of the camera coordinate system C but the horizontal
plane is parallel to the ground.

As presented in Fig. 3(c), we further project the point cloud onto the ground plane to estimate the
orientation of the boxes. Following the method described in [38], we calculate the direction of each
pair of points in the pseudo-LiDAR and construct a histogram of these calculated directions. The
direction with the highest frequency in the histogram is selected as the object orientation. Additionally,
we try Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the main feature components of the pseudo-
LiDAR through a linear transformation, assigning the direction with the greatest variance as the
orientation of the bounding box. Through experiments, we observe that the simpler and more efficient
PCA method can effectively extract the orientation of the objects (see Tab. 5(c)).

Bounding Box Search. After estimating the orientation, we enclose the pseudo-LiDAR of each
object with a tight 3D bounding box according to the object’s direction. These bounding boxes are
recorded as coarse pseudo boxes. However, due to the possible occlusion of objects in the images,
the generated pseudo-LiDAR may only cover part of the objects. On the other hand, the refined
pseudo-LiDAR may still contain noise. As a result, we observe that the enclosed boxes can be

5


---Page Break---
undersized or oversized. Therefore, to generate the proper pseudo labels for training, we further
search for the optimal bounding box based on the coarse pseudo box.

We first determine whether the dimensions of a coarse pseudo box are within a reasonable
range.
Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 [1], are employed to gather data on
the typical sizes of objects. For instance, we prompt GPT-4 with “Please provide the (length,
width, height) for objects of the <CLASS> category according to their typical sizes in real life.”

Figure 4: Ray tracing loss and point ratio loss.

In our experiments, we find that GPT-4 can of-
fer reliable information regarding the usual sizes
of objects within specific categories, including
their width, length, and height. When we re-
place the object sizes predicted by GPT-4 with
the sizes statistically derived from the ground
truth annotations in the training dataset, the per-
formance is similar (see Tab. 5(d)). The pre-
dicted dimensions from GPT-4 are considered
as the category priors. If the dimensions of a
coarse pseudo box fall within the reasonable
range of its corresponding category priors, the
coarse pseudo box is considered a valid pseudo
label. This range is set as τ1 to τ2 times the
priors, where τ1 represents the lower threshold and τ2 is the upper threshold. Conversely, if it is too
small or too large, it undergoes an optimal box search process.

Potential boxes are proposed based on the coarse pseudo box. Since the pseudo-LiDAR is constructed
from the projection of points captured on the surface of the object, at least one edge of the coarse
pseudo box should belong to the optimal pseudo box. Therefore, in the bird’s-eye view, for each of
the four corners of the coarse pseudo box, we propose two boxes for two possible directions with the
class dimension priors (see the blue point and two blue boxes in Fig. 3(d)). That is to say, there are 8
proposal boxes for each coarse pseudo box.

We then select the best-fitting proposal box through a box-searching procedure. Given that monocular
RGB cameras only capture the surfaces of objects facing the camera, a valid bounding box should
have point clouds concentrated around the edges closer to the camera compared to those farther away.
Therefore, we borrow the ray tracing loss from [38] to determine which box is proper. As shown
in Fig. 4(a), the loss calculates the distance between each LiDAR point and the nearest intersection
point between the proposal box and the camera ray to that point. However, calculating the ray tracing
loss alone is not sufficient. Since the calculation of the ray tracing loss only includes points where the
camera ray intersects with the box, there can sometimes be shortcuts. As shown in Fig. 4(b), Box C
has less ray tracing loss, but it is clearly not what we want. Thus, we propose adding a point ratio
loss that considers the ratio of the point cloud enclosed by the box to the overall object point cloud.
The overall box-searching loss is the sum of these two losses:

Ltrace =

∥P −Pinter∥2 ,
if RayP intersects with the proposal box,
0,
otherwise.

Lpoint_ratio = 1 −Ninside/Nall,
Lsearch = Ltrace + λLpoint_ratio ,
(2)

where Ninside and Nall denote the number of points inside the pseudo box and the total number of
points, λ is the hyper-parameter that balances the contribution of two losses. For each of the objects,
the proposal box with the lowest box-searching loss is considered the pseudo label for training.

3.3
Training Detector on Auto-Generated Pseudo Labels

We adopt Cube R-CNN [3] as our basic 3D monocular detector, and replace its classification branch
with a text-alignment head that aligns the output object features with text embeddings. The aligning
loss Laligning = LCE(ci, yi), where ci = fi · t represents the dot product of the object feature fi
and text embeddings t, and yi denotes the pseudo label predicted by Grounded-SAM. The training
objective is defined as: Ltrain = Llocalization + Laligning.

Experiments

We first evaluate the proposed OVM3D-Det model on outdoor datasets, KITTI [14] and nuScenes [5],
as well as indoor datasets, SUN RGB-D [52] and ARKitScenes [2] (Sec. 4.2). We then provide
thorough ablation studies and detailed analysis to uncover the factors contributing to the effectiveness
of OVM3D-Det (Sec. 4.3). Finally, we show qualitative results of our OVM3D-Det model (Sec. 4.4).

4.1
Experiment Setup

Datasets. We evaluate OVM3D-Det on the KITTI [14] and nuScenes [5] datasets for outdoor settings,
and on the SUN RGB-D [52] and ARKitScenes [2] datasets for indoor settings. Note that neither of
these datasets appeared in the training data of Unidepth [40], so there is no data leakage. KITTI [14]
has 7,481 images for training and 7,518 images for testing. Since the official test set is unavailable,
we follow [3] to resplit the training set into 3,321 training images, 391 validation images, and 3,769
test images. For nuScenes [5], we use 26,215 images for training, 1,915 images for validation, and
6,019 images for testing. SUN RGB-D [52] consists of a total of 10k samples, each annotated with
oriented 3D bounding boxes, in which 4,929 samples are used for training, 356 samples for validation,
and 5,050 samples for test following [3]. ARKitScenes [2] includes 48,046 images for training,
5,268 images for validation, and 7,610 images for testing.

Metrics. We report 3D average-precision (AP3D) following Cube R-CNN [3] for fair comparison.
Predictions are matched to ground truth by calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU3D) of 3D
bounding boxes. We report mAP3D across all categories over the IoU3D thresholds from 0.05 to
0.50 at a 0.05 step. We split the dataset into base and novel categories to evaluate open-vocabulary
performance. In KITTI, there are 2 base classes (car, pedestrian) and 3 novel classes (cyclist, van,
truck); nuScenes has 3 base and 6 novel classes; SUN RGB-D includes 20 base and 18 novel classes;
and ARKitScenes has 8 base and 6 novel classes. Please refer to Sec. A for more details. We would
like to note that we do not need to split the datasets into base and novel splits to train our model. We
introduce this base/novel setting only to compare our method with the proposed baselines due to the
lack of a suitable baseline before.

Implementation Details. We prompt the off-the-shelf Grounded-SAM [47] to detect and segment
objects in new categories. For the depth estimation, we adopt the state-of-state-art monocular depth
estimation model, Unidepth [40]. Both models are used directly for inference without any fine-tuning.
We train on the monocular 3D object detection model Cube R-CNN [3] with the auto-generated
pseudo labels, modifying the classification branch to output a 768-dimensional feature and following
most of its optimization hyper-parameters. See Sec. E for more details.

Main Results

Baselines. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore open vocabulary monocular 3D
object detection models. Therefore, to better evaluate the proposed task, we introduce the following
baselines: 1) We train the Cube R-CNN [3] with all dataset annotations, including both base and
novel classes, to establish the oracle baseline. 2) We develop another baseline to enable Cube R-CNN
with open vocabulary capabilities by utilizing Grounding DINO. Specifically, we first use the base
class annotations of the training set to train a class-agnostic Cube R-CNN detection model. This
enables it to localize the instances from the novel classes during testing, without being limited to a
fixed set of categories. During testing, we use Cube R-CNN to predict 3D bounding box proposals
and use Grounding DINO to obtain 2D detection results from the images. We then back-project
the 3D bounding boxes onto the image frames and match them with the predictions of Grounding
DINO. The matched 2D detection boxes from Grounding DINO are then used to assign categories
to the corresponding 3D bounding boxes. 3) Although our OVM3D-Det model does not require
any annotations for training, we provide a baseline for comparison that is trained using ground-truth
annotations for base classes and pseudo labels for novel classes, denoted by OVM3D-Det∗.

Results. We report the open-vocabulary monocular 3D object detection results on outdoor and indoor
datasets in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, respectively. It can be observed that the unsupervised OVM3D-Det
model significantly outperforms the baseline on novel categories. Specifically, it achieves a 6.7%

improvement in average precision (AP) on the KITTI dataset, 9.7% AP on the nuScenes dataset,
8.5% AP on the SUN RGB-D dataset, and 16.8% AP on the ARKitScenes dataset. Besides, the
OVM3D-Det model trained on the ground truth annotations of the base class and the pseudo labels of
the novel class also surpasses the baseline by a large margin on the novel category. This indicates that
our framework does indeed generate accurate pseudo-labels for various classes, thereby enhancing
the model’s performance in the novel category.

In Fig. 6, we show the model performance varying with the amount of training data on KITTI. As
the training data increases, we observe a continuous improvement in performance. This highlights
the strong potential of our model, suggesting that it can be trained to achieve more generalized
open-vocabulary capabilities when using more readily available image data.

Comparison with Point Cloud-Based Methods. To compare our method with state-of-the-art
point cloud-based open-vocabulary 3D detection approaches, we first simply evaluate existing open
vocabulary detector OV-3DET [30] that is trained and tested on point cloud data using pseudo-LiDAR
as input. Specifically, we only replace the point cloud input of OV-3DET with the pseudo-LiDAR
which is unprojected from the RGB images and estimated depth maps. Other parts of the model in
OV-3DET are kept untouched for fair comparison. As shown in Tab. 3, directly changing the input
data format leads to poor performance with only 3.4% AP. This phenomenon is also observed and
discussed in previous works [36, 66, 60], which we attribute to the distribution shifts between real
point clouds and pseudo-LiDARs.

After being trained with pseudo-LiDAR, OV-3DET improves from 3.4% to 7.1% AP, marking a 2x
improvement compared to the original model. CODA [6] shows a slight improvement compared

to OV-3DET. Nonetheless, the 10.8% AP of our method still demonstrates our superiority, since
our approach focuses on adapting to the noisy nature of pseudo-LiDAR, whereas previous open-
vocabulary 3D detectors are mainly designed for real point clouds to generate pseudo labels. The key
designs that distinguish our method from other baselines are the adaptive pseudo-LiDAR erosion and
bounding box refinement techniques, incorporating the prior knowledge of language models. Our
method can generate pseudo labels more effectively for pseudo-LiDAR than other baselines.

For outdoor 3D detection, we also try to establish another baseline since OV-3DET [30] only includes
results on indoor data. We attempt to train OV-3DET on the KITTI dataset with pseudo-LiDAR.
As presented in Tab. 4, simply training on pseudo-LiDAR points causes a rather weak performance
of only 1.3% AP. This result reflects the nature of outdoor data that the vast range of spatial scale
could lead to intolerable pseudo-label errors from tiny noise. Therefore, it is challenging to generate
reasonable and reliable pseudo boxes due to the inaccurate object edges of the raw pseudo-LiDAR.

4.3
Ablation Studies

We conduct ablation studies on the KITTI dataset. The results are shown in Tab. 5. We report the
mean AP performance across all the classes for each model.

Comparison with Naive Framework. If we remove the refinement applied to pseudo-LiDAR
and bounding box (i.e., directly utilizing raw pseudo-LiDAR and tightly bounding it to obtain the
box), there is a significant decrease of 11.2% AP in model performance. This result shows the
effectiveness of our framework in addressing the noisy pseudo-LiDAR, where the refinement of both
the pseudo-LiDAR data and the estimated bounding boxes proves to be pivotal.

Mask Erosion. We replace the adaptive erosion process with a fixed kernel erosion, resulting in
a decline of 2.1% AP. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive erosion module,
indicating that a standard fixed kernel may not be suitable for all cases, as it could overly erode small
objects or be inadequate for larger objects with substantial noise.

Orientation Estimation. Here, we compare two methods for determining the orientation of boxes:
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or calculating the distribution of the directions of each
pair of points in the pseudo-LiDAR. We find that the simple and efficient PCA method performs
better, exceeding 1.8% AP.

Dimension Priors. The dimension priors of objects are an essential component of our method. They
not only assist in identifying unreasonable predictions of bounding boxes but also aid in correcting the
sizes of the bounding boxes. As shown in Tab. 5(d), the absence of these priors leads to a significant
decrease of 4.5% AP. Notably, when we utilize priors derived from a large language model or dataset
statistics, the results are similar. In Sec. B, we provide a thorough comparison of LLM-generated
priors and shape priors obtained from dataset statistics across all datasets. This suggests that the
large language model possesses a strong commonsense understanding, and further underscores the

potential of our approach to be transferred to a wide range of data. We also test the sensitivity of the
lower threshold τ1 and the upper threshold τ2 used for determining the reasonability of a box. As
shown in Tab. 5(f) and (g), they are stable within a wide range.

Box Search Loss. We further explore the impact of different loss functions on evaluating the
bounding box proposals. The results are presented in Tab. 5(e). Using ray tracing loss alone results in
inadequate performance, yielding only a 12.2% AP. However, adding the point ratio loss significantly
boosts performance to 18.5% AP.

Self-Training. Additionally, we can refine the model using a self-training approach, which involves
using the results from the previously well-trained model as pseudo labels in the subsequent training
process. As shown in the Tab. 6, self-training can further enhance the quality of the initially generated
pseudo boxes, improving detection performance for objects at various distances.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced OVM3D-Det, the first framework targeting image-based 3D open-
vocabulary detection. OVM3D-Det automatically labels open-vocabulary 3D bounding boxes using
only RGB images, exploring the great potential of leveraging omnipresent image data from the
internet. To address the noisy point clouds and occluded target objects in predicted pseudo-LiDAR,
we devise two innovative solutions: adaptive pseudo-LiDAR erosion and bounding box search
using world knowledge. Our open-vocabulary detector trained under OVM3D-Det outperforms the
baselines by at least +6.7% AP and up to +16.8% AP. In a word, we propose a simple, yet surprisingly
effective baseline method for image-based 3D open-vocabulary detection and we hope it could be a
new study point for future research.

Dimension Priors

Tab. 8 to 11 provide a comprehensive comparison between LLM-generated priors and shape priors
derived from dataset statistics across all datasets. For clarity, we keep one decimal place. As we use
shape priors solely to filter out pseudo boxes that may be unreliable due to noise or occlusion and to
refine them, it suffices as long as the shape priors fall within a reasonable range.

Image Erosion Process

We propose to employ the image erosion operation to eliminate inaccurate object mask edges, thereby
obtaining accurate pseudo-LiDAR after unprojection. Image erosion is a fundamental operation
in digital image processing that involves shrinking or wearing away the boundaries of foreground
objects in a binary image. As shown in Fig. 7, Mi is the binary mask of one object we interested,
where each pixel Mi(x, y) is either 0 (background) or 1 (foreground). Let B(u, v) represent the
elements of the structuring element B, which is a small binary matrix of size m × n. Erosion of the
mask Mi by the structuring element B is denoted as Mi ⊖B.

In our experiment, we employ a 3x3 structuring element B where all elements are set to 1. The
erosion operation can be applied repeatedly. The intensity of erosion can be controlled by adjusting
the number of erosion iterations. We note that aggressive erosion may completely remove small
objects like distant pedestrians, while mild erosion may leave considerable noise on large objects.
Therefore, for masks with a smaller area, we use a smaller number of iterations; conversely, for masks
with a larger area, we use a larger number of iterations, ensuring more accurate pseudo-LiDAR.

Performance Varies with Depth Estimation Quality

Besides Unidepth, we evaluate alternative depth estimation models, such as Metric3D [67]. As
shown in Tab. 12, we find that the more accurate the depth estimation model we use, the better the
performance of the trained open-vocabulary monocular 3D detection model, suggesting promising
potential as depth estimation models advance.

Implementation Details

When searching for the optimal box, we set λ to 5 for indoor scenes and 10 for outdoor scenes to
balance the ray tracing loss and point ratio loss. For the adaptive erosion module, for outdoor scenes,
if the maximum width of the instance mask exceeds 10 pixels, image erosion is performed for 4
iterations; otherwise, 2 iterations. For indoor scenes, the values are 12 and 2 iterations, respectively.
As we aim to evaluate the benchmarks, we utilize the label lists from the datasets to query the
open-vocabulary 2D model for generating pseudo labels of the classes of interest. Following Cube
R-CNN, we utilize the DLA34 backbone [69]-FPN [27], which is pretrained on ImageNet [49]. We
employ the SGD optimizer, with the learning rate decaying by a factor of 10 at 60% and 80% of the
training process. During training, we apply random data augmentation techniques such as horizontal
flipping and scaling within the range of [0.50, 1.25]. The model is trained for 29,000 iterations with
a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.02 on both SUN RGB-D [52] and ARKitScenes [2], a
batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 0.01 on KITTI [14], and a batch size of 32 and a learning
rate of 0.01 on nuScenes [5]. We train on the KITTI dataset for ∼8 hours with 2 A100 GPUs, on
nuScenes for ∼6 hours with 4 A100 GPUs, on SUN RGB-D for ∼12 hours with 2 A100 GPUs, and
on ARKitScenes for ∼20 hours with 2 A100 GPUs.

Figure 8: Failure case.

We present some failure cases of OVM3D-Det in Fig. 8. (a), (b) and (c) are instances of distant
objects being missed by detection. In (d), the reflection of a car on the window is mistakenly detected
as a vehicle. As our framework relies on foundational depth estimation models for generating
pseudo-LiDAR for auto-labeling, the accuracy of depth estimation directly affects label precision.
Particularly, errors increase quadratically with distance, resulting in lower-quality pseudo-labels for
distant objects and thus limiting our model’s performance at longer ranges. This issue merits further
investigation in our future research endeavors.

Limitations

Our proposed OVM3D-Det framework relies on advanced depth estimation models to generate pseudo-
LiDAR. Although state-of-the-art depth estimation models have demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities, their predictions for distant objects are not yet accurate enough, which may lead to
errors when generating pseudo labels for these distant objects. Additionally, the performance of
monocular systems may degrade under adverse lighting or weather conditions, as these factors
directly affect the quality and clarity of the input images. These limitations underscore the need for
future research to enhance the robustness and versatility of open vocabulary monocular 3D detection
systems, particularly in challenging and dynamic environments.

I
Broader Impact

The end results of this research are a novel approach to 3D detection that can be applied to autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and other robotics applications. By enabling improved 3D object detection
using monocular images, our framework has the potential to enhance the safety and accuracy of this
system, contributing to the overall advancement of autonomous technologies. Before deployment, it
is crucial to establish appropriate safety thresholds and conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability.
While our approach does not explicitly exploit dataset biases, it is subject to the same limitations and
potential biases as other machine learning techniques.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s
contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have included our claims and contributions in the introduction/abstract.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the
paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions
made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this
question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the
results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not
attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have discussed the limitations throughout the paper when necessary.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the
paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of
these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification,
asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these
assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested
on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit
assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For
example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or
images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to
provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how
they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address
problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers
as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that
aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize
that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms
that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not
penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a
complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our paper does not include theoretical results.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear
in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to
provide intuition.

20


---Page Break---
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by
formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experi-
mental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the
paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have disclosed the implementation information necessary for reproducibility in
the main paper and the appendix as thoroughly as possible.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by
the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and
data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to
make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For
example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might
suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary
to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide
access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish
this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the
results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a
model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to
provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the
contribution. For example

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to
reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the
architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either
be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model
(e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are
welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of
closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g.,
to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to
reproducing or verifying the results.
5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to
faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Code will be released.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/
CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible,
so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code,
unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce
the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/
CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access
the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.

21


---Page Break---
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed
method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which
ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if
applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is
recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters,
how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have provided experimental details in the experiments section of our paper. More
details can be found in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is
necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [No]
Justification: The computing resources we have limit the possibility of obtaining the experiment
statistical significance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence
intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main
claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example,
train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given
experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a
library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the
mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably
report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of
errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures
symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they
were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer
resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experi-
ments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have indicated the compute resources required for this paper.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud
provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimen-
tal runs as well as estimate the total compute.

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the
experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it
into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS
Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We understand and conform to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation
from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration
due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal
impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discussed the detailed broader impact in the appendix.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or
why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g.,
disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deploy-
ment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy
considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to par-
ticular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative
applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that
an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for
disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for
optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used
as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional)
misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strate-
gies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for
monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time,
improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for the responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image
generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We believe no such risk is involved.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary
safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere
to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should
describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require
this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets

23


---Page Break---
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly
respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We have credited and referenced the papers of the codes and models used in
producing this work. We have read and follow the licenses of the works.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of
that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should
be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some
datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived
asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s
creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release well-documented assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their sub-
missions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations,
etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is
used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create
an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as
details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects involved.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of
the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the
main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or
other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Sub-
jects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such
risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals
(or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were
obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects involved.
Guidelines:

24


---Page Break---
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human
subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be
required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly
state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and
locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines
for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applica-
ble), such as the institution conducting the review.
