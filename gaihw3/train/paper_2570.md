Abstract

Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advance-
ments in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecular
generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas per-
meability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We
present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molec-
ular generation. Graph DiT integrates an encoder to learn numerical and categorical
property representations with the Transformer-based denoiser. Unlike previous
graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the
forward diffusion process, Graph DiT is trained with a novel graph-dependent
noise model for accurate estimation of graph-related noise in molecules. We ex-
tensively validate Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule
generation. Results demonstrate the superiority of Graph DiT across nine metrics
from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer
inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further
demonstrates its practical utility.

Introduction

Diffusion models for molecular graphs are essential for inverse design of materials and drugs by
generating molecules and polymers (macro-molecules) [40, 46], because the models can be effectively
trained to predict discrete graph structures and atom/bond types in denoising processes [43]. Practical
inverse designs consider multiple factors such as molecular synthetic score and various properties [15],
known as the task of multi-conditional graph generation.

Existing work converted multiple conditions into a single one and solved the task as single-condition
generation [5, 25]. However, multi-property relations may not be properly or explicitly defined [5].
First, the properties have diverse scales and units. For example, the synthetic complexity ranges from
1 to 5 [8], while the gas permeability varies widely, exceeding 10,000 in Barrier units [4]. This gap
makes it hard for models to balance the conditions. Second, multi-conditions consist of a mix of
categorical and numerical properties. The common practice of addition [47] or multiplication [25] is
inadequate for combination.

Figure 1(a) empirically illustrates the challenges in multi-conditional generation, i.e., discovering
molecules meeting multiple properties. We used a test set of 100 data points with three properties: syn-
thesizability (Synth.) [12], O2 and N2 permeability (O2Perm and N2Perm) [4]. A single-conditional
diffusion model generated up to 30 graphs for each condition, resulting in a total of 90 graphs for three
conditions. We sort the 30 graphs in each set using a polymer property Oracle (see appendix B.3).
Then, we check whether a shared polymer structure that meets multi-property constraints can be
identified across different condition sets. If we find the polymer, its rank K (where K is between 1
and 30) indicates how high it appears on the lists, considering all condition sets. If not, we set K
as 30. Figure 1(a) shows the frequency distribution of K on the 100 test cases. The median K was

Our idea, multi-

successfully generated polymers that satis-

a higher rank than 30 in any set of the
single-conditional generated graphs.

30, indicating that the multiple properties were not met on over half of the test polymers despite
generating a large number of graphs.

To address these challenges, we project multi-properties into representations by learning, thereby
guiding the diffusion process for molecule generation. We propose the Graph Diffusion Transformer
(Graph DiT) for graph denoising under conditions. Graph DiT has a condition encoder for property
representation learning and a graph denoiser. The condition encoder utilizes a novel clustering-based
method for numerical properties and one-hot encoding for categorical ones to learn multi-property
representations. The graph denoiser first integrates node and edge features into graph tokens, then
denoise these tokens with adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN) in Transformer layers [19, 34].
AdaLN replaces the molecular statistics (mean and variance) in each hidden layer with those from
the condition representation, effectively outperforming other predictor-based and predictor-free
conditioning methods [22, 43, 34], as shown in Section 4.4. We observe that existing forward
diffusion processes [43, 22] apply noise separately to atoms and bonds, which may compromise the
accuracy of Graph DiT in noise estimation. Hence, we propose a novel graph-dependent noise model
that effectively applies noise tailored to the dependencies between atoms and bonds within the graph.

Results in Figure 1(b) show that the polymers generated by Graph DiT closely align with multi-
property constraints. For each test case, we have one graph generated from Graph DiT conditional
on three properties. The Oracle determines the rank of this graph among 30 single-conditionally
generated graphs for each condition. We find the median ranks are 4, 9, and 11, for Synth., O2 Perm,
and N2 Perm, respectively, all much higher than 30. Note that the ranked set of 30 graphs was very
competitive because the model was trained on the specific condition dedicatedly.

In experiments, we evaluate model performance on one polymer and three small molecule datasets.
The polymer dataset includes four numerical conditions for multi-conditional evaluation. Our model
has the lowest average mean absolute error (MAE), significantly reducing the error by 17.86%
compared to the best baseline. It also excels in small molecule tasks, achieving over 0.9 accuracy on
task-related categorical conditions, notably surpassing the baseline accuracy of less than 0.6. We also
examine the model’s utility in inverse polymer designs for O2/N2 gas separation, with domain expert
feedback highlighting our model’s practical utility in multi-conditional molecular design.

Problem Definition

2.1
Multi-Conditional Inverse Molecular Design

A molecular graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of nodes (atoms) V and edges (bonds) E. We
follow [43] and define “non-bond” as a type of edge. There are N atoms and each atom has a one-hot
encoding, denoting the atom type. We represent it as XV ∈RN×FV , where FV is the total number
of atom types. Similarly, the bond features are a tensor XE ∈RN×N×FE, representing both the
graph structure and FE bond types.

Let C = {c1, c2, . . . , cM} be a set of M numerical and categorical conditions. The task is: q(G |
c1, c2, . . . , cM) ∝q(G)q(c1, c2, . . . , cM | G), where q represents observed probability. We use a
model parameterized by θ for multi-conditional molecular generation pθ(G | C). The evaluation
involves both distribution learning q(G) [35] and condition control q(c1, c2, . . . , cM | G). We
follow previous work in assuming that there exist different oracle functions O that can independently
evaluate each conditioned property [14]: q(c1, c2, . . . , cM | G) = QM
i=1 Oi(ci | G). Note that the
oracles are not used in the training of pθ.

2.2
Diffusion Model on Graph Data

Diffusion models consist of forward and reverse diffusion processes [17]. We refer to the forward
diffusion process as the diffusion process following [17]. The diffusion process q(G1:T | G0) =
QT
t=1 q(Gt | Gt−1) corrupts molecular graph data (G0 = G) into noisy states Gt. As timesteps
T →∞, q(GT ) converges a stationary distribution π(G). The reverse Markov process pθ(G0:T ) =
q(GT ) QT
t=1 pθ(Gt−1 | Gt), parameterized by neural networks, gradually denoises the latent states
toward the desired data distribution.

Diffusion Process
One may perturb Gt in a discrete state-space to capture the structural properties
of molecules [43]. Two transition matrices QV ∈RFV ×FV and QE ∈RFE×FE are defined for
nodes XV and edges XE, respectively [43]. Then, each step q(Gt | Gt−1, G0) = q(Gt | Gt−1) in
the diffusion process is sampled as follows.
(
q(Xt
V | Xt−1
V
) = Cat
 

q(Xt

 

E; p = Xt−1
E Qt

,
(1)

where Cat(X; p) denotes sampling from a categorical distribution with probability p. We remove
the subscript (V/E) when the description applies to both nodes and edges. It is assumed that the noise
Qi (i ≤t) is independently applied to X in each step i, allowing us to rewrite q(Xt | Xt−1) as the
probability of the initial state q(Xt | X0) = Cat
 
Xt; p = X0 ¯Qt
, where ¯Qt = Q

i≤t Qi.

Noise Scheduling
Transition matrices QV and QE control the noise applied to atom features
and bond features, respectively. Vignac et al. [43] defined π(G) = (mX ∈RFV , mE ∈RFE)
as the marginal distributions of atom types and bond types. The transition matrix at timestep t is
Qt = αtI+(1−αt)1m′ for atoms or bonds, where m′ denotes the transposed row vector. Therefore,
we have ¯Qt = ¯αtI + (1 −¯αt)1m′, where ¯αt = Qt
τ=1 ατ. The cosine schedule [32] is often chosen
for ¯αt = cos(0.5π(t/T + s)/(1 + s))2.

Reverse Process
With the initial sampling GT ∼π(G), the reverse process generates G0 iteratively
in reversed steps t = T, T −1, . . . , 0. We use a neural network to predict the probability pθ( ˜G0 | Gt)
as the product over nodes and edges [1, 43]:

pθ( ˜G0 | Gt) =
Y

v∈V
pθ(vt−1 | Gt)
Y

e∈E
pθ(et−1 | Gt)
(2)

pθ( ˜G0 | Gt) could be combined with q(Gt−1 | Gt, G0) to estimate the reverse distribution on the
graph pθ(Gt−1 | Gt). For example, pθ(vt−1 | Gt) is marginalized over predictions of node types
˜v ∈˜xv, which applies similarly to edges:

pθ(vt−1 | Gt) =
X

˜v∈˜xv
q(vt−1 | ˜v, Gt)pθ(˜v | Gt).
(3)

The neural network could be trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood [43].

where x ∈G0 denotes the node or edge features. Typically, the reverse process in diffusion models
does not consider molecular properties as conditions. While there have been efforts to introduce
property-related guidance using additional predictors, the more promising approach of predictor-free
guidance [16], particularly in multi-conditional generation, remains underexplored.

Multi-Conditional Graph Diffusion Transformers

We present the denoising framework of Graph DiT in Figure 2. The condition encoder learns the
representation of M conditions. The statistics of this representation like mean and variance are used
to replace the ones from the molecular representations [19] (see Section 3.2). Besides, we introduce a
new noise model in the diffusion process to better fit graph-structured molecules (see Section 3.1).

3.1
Graph-Dependent Noise Models

The transition probability of a node or an edge should rely on the joint distribution of nodes and edges
in the prior state. However, as an example shown in Eq. (1), current diffusion models [22, 43, 25]
treat node and edge state transitions as independent, misaligning with the denoising process in Eq. (3).
This difference between the sampling distributions of noise in the diffusion and reverse processes
introduces unnecessary challenges to multi-conditional molecular generations.

To address this, we use a single matrix XG ∈RN×FG to represent graph tokens for G, with
FG = FV + N · FE. Token representations are created by concatenating the node feature matrix XV
and the flattened edge connection matrix from XE. Each row vector in XG contains features for
both nodes and edges, representing all connections and non-connections. Hence, we could design
a transition matrix QG considering the joint distribution of nodes and edges. QG ∈RFG×FG is
constructed from four matrices QV , QEV ∈RFE×FV , QE, QV E ∈RFV ×FE, denoting the transition
probability (“dependent old state” →“target new state”) node →node; edge →node; edge →
edge; node →edge, respectively.

where ⊗denotes the Kronecker product, 1N, 1′
N, and 1N×N represent the column vector, row vector,
and matrix with all 1 elements, respectively. According to Eq. (5), the first FV columns in QG
determine the node feature transitions based on both node features (first FV rows) and edge features
(remaining N · FE rows). Conversely, the remaining N · FE columns determine the edge feature
transitions, depending on the entire graph. We introduce a new diffusion noise model:

where ˜p is the unnormalized probability and g
Cat denotes categorical sampling: The first FV columns
of ˜p are normalized to sample Xt
V , while the remaining N·E dimensions are reshaped and normalized
to sample edges Xt
E. These components are combined to form Xt
G, completing the g
Cat sampling.

Choice of QV E and QEV
Similar to the definitions of mV and mE [43], we leverage the prior
knowledge within the training data for the formulation of task-specific matrices, QEV and QV E. We
calculate co-occurrence frequencies of atom and bond types in training molecular graphs to obtain the
marginal atom-bond co-occurrence probability distribution. For each bond type, each row in mEV
represents the probability of co-occurring atom types. mV E is the transpose of mEV and has a similar
meaning. Subsequently, we define QEV = ¯αtI+(1−¯αt)1m′
EV and QV E = ¯αtI+(1−¯αt)1m′
V E.

3.2
Denoising Models with Multi-Property Conditions

We present Graph DiT as the denoising model to generate molecules under multi-conditions C =
{c1, c2, . . . , cM} without extra predictors.

Predictor-Free Guidance
The predictor-free reverse process ˆpθ(Gt−1 | Gt, C) aims to generate
molecules with a high probability q(C | G0). This could be achieved by a linear combination of the
log probability for unconditional and conditional denoising [16]:

ˆpθ(Gt−1 | Gt, C) = log pθ(Gt−1 | Gt) + s
 
log pθ(Gt−1 | Gt, C) −log pθ(Gt−1 | Gt)

,
(7)

where s denotes the scale of conditional guidance. Unlike classifier-free guidance [16], which
typically predicts noise, we directly estimate pθ( ˜G0 | Gt, C). We one one denoising model fθ(Gt, C)
for both pθ( ˜G0 | Gt) and pθ( ˜G0 | Gt, C). Here, fθ(Gt, C = ∅) computes the unconditional
probability by substituting the original conditional embeddings with the null value. During training,
we randomly drop the condition with a ratio, i.e., C = ∅, to learn the embedding of the null value.
fθ(Gt = Xt
G, C) comprises two components: the condition encoder and the graph denoiser. An
overview of the architecture is presented in Figure 2.

Condition Encoder
We treat the timestep t as a special condition and follow [31] to obtain a D-
dimensional representation t with sinusoidal encoding. For property-related numerical or categorical
condition ci ∈C, we apply distinct encoding operations to get D-dimensional representation. For a
categorical condition, we use the one-hot encoding. For a numerical variable, we introduce a clustering
encoding method. This defines learnable centroids, assigning ci to clusters, and transforming the
soft assignment vector of condition values into the representation. It could be implemented using
two Linear layers and a Softmax layer in the middle as: Linear (Softmax (Linear(ci))). Finally,
we could obtain the representation of the condition as c = PM
i=1 encode(ci), where encode is the
specific encoding method based on the condition type. For numerical conditions, we evaluate our
proposed clustering-based approach against alternatives like direct or interval-based encodings [28].
As noted in Section 4.4, the clustering encoding outperforms the other methods.

Graph Denoiser: Transformer Layers
Given the noisy graph at timestep t, the graph tokens are
first encoded into the hidden space as H = Linear(Xt
G), where H ∈RN×D. We then adapt the
standard Transformer layers [42] with self-attention and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), but replace
the normalization with the adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN) controlled by the representations
of the conditions [19, 34]: H = AdaLN(H, c). For each row h in H:

AdaLN (h, c) = γθ(c) ⊙h −µ (h)

σ (h)
+ βθ(c),
(8)

where µ(·) and σ(·) are mean and variance values. ⊙indicates element-wise product. γθ(·) and
βθ(·) are neural network modules in fθ(·), each of which consists of two linear layers with SiLU
activation [11] in the middle. We have a gated variant AdaLNgate for residuals:

AdaLNgate (h, c) = αθ(c) ⊙AdaLN (h, c)
(9)

We apply the zero initialization for the first layer of γθ(·), βθ(·), and αθ(·) [34]. There are other
options to learn the structure representation from the condition [34]: In-Context conditioning adds
condition representation to the structure representation at the beginning of the structure encoder, and
Cross-Attention calculates cross-attention between the condition and structure representation. We
observe in Section 4.4 that AdaLN performs best among them.

Graph Denoiser: Final MLP
We have the hidden states H after the final Transformer layers, the
MLP is used to predict node probabilities ˜X0
V and edge probabilities ˜X0
E at t = 0:

˜X0
G = AdaLN(MLP(H), c).
(10)

We split the output XG into atom and bond features ˜X0
V , ˜X0
E. The first FV dimensions of ˜X0
G
represent node type probabilities, and the remaining N · FE dimensions cover probabilities for N
edge types associated with the node, as detailed in Section 3.1.

Generation to Molecule Conversion
A common way of converting generated graphs to molecules
selects only the largest connected component [43], denoted as Graph DiT-LCC in our model. For
Graph DiT, we connect all components by randomly selecting atoms. It minimally alters the generated
structure to more accurately reflect model performance than Graph DiT-LCC.

Experiment

RQ1: We validate the generative power of Graph DiT compared to baselines from molecular
optimization and diffusion models in Section 4.2. RQ2: We study a polymer inverse design for gas
separation in Section 4.3. RQ3: We conduct further analysis to examine Graph DiT in Section 4.4.

4.1
Experimental Setup

We use datasets with over ten types of atoms and up to fifty nodes in a molecular graph. We include
both numerical and categorical properties for drugs and materials, offering a benchmark for evaluation
across diverse chemical spaces. Model performance is validated across up to nine metrics, including
distribution coverage, diversity, and condition control capacity for various properties.

Datasets and Input Conditions
We have one polymer dataset [40] for materials, featuring three
numerical gas permeability conditions: O2Perm, CO2Perm, and N2Perm. For drug design, we create
three class-balanced datasets from MoleculeNet [46]: HIV, BBBP, and BACE, each with a categorical
property related to HIV virus replication inhibition, blood-brain barrier permeability, or human β-
secretase 1 inhibition, respectively. We have two more numerical conditions for synthesizability
from synthetic accessibility (SAS) and complexity scores (SCS) [12, 8].

Evaluation
We randomly split the dataset into training, validation, and testing (reference) sets
in a 6:2:2 ratio. Evaluations are conducted on 10,000 generated examples with metrics [35] (1)
molecular validity (Validity); (2) heavy atom type coverage (Coverage); (3) internal diversity among
the generated examples (Diversity); (4) fragment-based similarity with the reference set (Similarity);
(5) Fr´echet ChemNet Distance with the reference set (Distance) [36]; MAE between the generated
and conditioned (6) synthetic accessibility score [12] (Synth.); (7)∼(9) MAE/Accuracy for the numer-
ical/categorical task conditions (Property). The evaluation Oracle uses random forest trained on all
task-related molecules [14]. Lower MAE or higher accuracy indicates stronger model controllability.

Baselines
We select strong and popular molecular optimization baselines from recent studies [14]:
Graph-GA [20], MARS [47], JTVAE [21] with Bayesian optimization (JTVAE-BO), LSTM [6] on
SMILES with Hill Climbing (LSTM-HC). We include the most recent diffusion models: GDSS[22],
DiGress [43], and their conditional version with extra predictors: MOOD [25], and DiGress v2 [43].
We train multi-task predictors using the same architecture for MOOD and DiGress v2 models to
provide additional guidance for generation. For molecular optimization, we formulate the condition
set of each test data point as a combined goal, minimizing the sum of the normalized errors between
generated and input properties. We train a random forest model for each property using the training
data to optimize the molecular structure.

4.2
RQ1: Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation

We have the observations from Table 1 and Table 2:

Chemical Validity
High validity may not accurately represent the model’s generative performance
if hard-coded rules are introduced in the algorithm. For example, GraphGA could eliminate non-valid
molecules during mutation and crossover iterations to achieve perfect validity in the final evaluation.
Without rule checking in the generation-to-molecule step, DiGress, GDSS, and MOOD show a
marked performance decline, with validity often dropping from 0.99 to below 0.6. In contrast, Graph
DiT often maintains over 0.8 validity without any rule-based processing.

Distribution Learning
GraphGA is a simple yet effective baseline for generating in-distribution
molecules, e.g., on BBBP and HIV generation datasets. Diffusion model baselines such as DiGress
and MOOD could produce diverse molecules but often fail to capture the original data distribution in
multi-conditional tasks. Graph DiT shows the competitive performance of diffusion models in fitting
complex molecular data distributions. Using fragment-based similarity and neural network-based
distance metrics [36], we achieve the best in the polymer task and rank second in the HIV small
molecule task, involving up to 11 and 29 types of heavy atoms, respectively.

Condition Controllability
LSTM-HC surpasses many baselines, achieving lower average MAE
on polymer properties and higher rankings on small molecular properties. However, its control
over synthetic scores in polymer tasks is relatively poor. Conversely, MARS effectively manages
synthetic scores for polymers but exhibits a larger MAE in gas permeability conditions compared
to other baselines. GDSS performs well in gas permeability control but underperforms Graph GA
and MARS in terms of the synthetic score condition. DiGress v2 and MOOD, although equipped
with the predictor guidance, still exhibit limited condition control compared to their unconditional
counterparts over polymer and small molecule tasks. These baselines struggle to balance and control
multiple conditions in generation. In contrast, Graph DiT significantly improves diffusion models and
achieves the best multi-conditional performance in all tasks. In polymer tasks, Graph DiT reduces
MAE on all gas permeability conditions, averaging +17.8% improvement over the best baseline
LSTM-HC. For small molecule tasks, Graph DiT consistently ranks top-1 in condition controllability
with over 0.9 accuracy in categorical conditions. Compared to Graph DiT-LCC, we observe that
Graph DiT, which connects all generated graph components, shows better controllability performance
due to minimal rule-based post-generation processing.

RQ2: Polymer Inverse Design for Gas Separation
We aim to design polymers with high O2 and low N2 permeability, demonstrating the models’
precise control over related properties. Following Robeson [38]’s definition of high-performance
polymers based on the O2/N2 permeability ratio, we selected 16 polymers meeting this criterion
from 609 examples as our test/reference set. The remaining data is used for training and validation.
Subsequently, we generated 1,000 polymers conditioned on test set labels.

In Figure 3, we present the top three polymers generated by each model for a case study with expertise.
Initially, a random forest algorithm identifies the top five polymers per method based on average
MAE in two gas permeability. These 25 polymers are then shuffled and evaluated by four polymer
scientists, who rank them from 1 to 25 using their domain knowledge. Rankings are normalized to a
Utility Score (UtS) ranging from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater utility. The variance
in UtS is converted into an Agreement Score (AS) for further evaluation. As shown in Figure 3,
there is a high consensus among experts that the three polymers generated by Graph DiT are the
most promising for successful polymer inverse design tasks. More details are in appendix D. By
comparing generated examples from different models, we have further observations:

• DiGress and MOOD struggle to capture polymerization points, marked with asterisks
(“*”), which is one of the most important features that distinguish polymers from small
molecules. Additionally, the two methods frequently feature excessive carbon atoms and
overly large cycles. These molecular configurations with significant distortion from the
canonical geometry of stable compounds may lead to poor synthesizability [35, 7].
• LSTM-HC may result in too-long carbon chains with limited diversity. MARS produces
examples with asymmetrical graph structures, challenging polymer synthesis [10, 2].

---Page Break---
• Graph DiT generates structurally diverse and symmetric polymers with two polymerization
points, indicative of more valid and synthesizable polymer structures. The first two, which
are polyimides, imply effective gas separation performance [24].

RQ3: Ablation Studies and Model Analysis

Model Components
In light of Table 1, we analyze three components that impact our model’s
learning in various conditions. Our assessment of relative performance is based on the ratio between
our method and comparative approaches. The first component is numerical conditional encoding.
Results in Figure 4(a) highlight the superiority of clustering encoding over direct and interval-based
encoding, particularly in controlling gas permeability, despite its slightly lower diversity. The second
component concerns the neural architecture for conditions. As shown in Figure 4(b), similar
to Figure 4(a), AdaLN surpasses both In-Context Conditioning and Cross-Attention in learning
distribution with better condition controllability. The third component validates the importance of the
graph-dependent noise model compared to separately applying noise to atoms and bonds. It also
shows the improvement of the predictor-free Graph DiT over the predictor-guided DiGress v2, even
without the graph-dependent noise model. More results on model controllability are in appendix E.

Table 3: Oracles for Generation Evaluation: We
consider three Oracles. Generative performance
is ranked on average from 1 to 9 across six prop-
erties, with various Oracles yielding similar out-
comes. We highlight models with the same rank-
ing sequence in different Oracle evaluation.

Oracle Selections
We analyze the robustness of
Oracles in evaluating six task-related properties
(three gas permeability and three small molecule
properties) across six conditional generation tasks.
Oracles are switched from Random Forest to
Gaussian Process or Support Vector Machines
for ranking generative model performance. Re-
sults in Table 3 show consistent rankings (Graph
DiT, LSTM-HC, MARS, JTVAE-BO, MOOD,
GDSS, GraphGA). It indicates that while perfectly
approximating the truth properties of generated
molecules is difficult, we could effectively com-
pare the relative performance of various models.
Graph DiT consistently ranked first among baselines.

Related Work

Diffusion Models for Molecules: Score-based diffusion models applied noise and denoising in
continuous space [33, 22]. DiGress [43] used discrete noise as transition matrices based on marginal
distributions of atom and bond types. Extra predictor models are studied to guide the generation
process in DiGress and GDSS [25]. Diffusion models could also be used for molecular property
prediction [27], for conformation [48] and molecule generation with 3D atomic coordinates [18, 49, 3].
We focus on molecular graph generation, considering the high computational cost of accurate 3D
coordinates for larger molecules like polymers [23]. We explore predictor-free diffusion guidance,
instead of the classifier guidance [9, 44], for generating molecules under categorical and numerical
conditions. It can be integrated with diffusion models for atomic coordinates in future research.

Molecular Optimization: Optimization algorithms could optimize molecules towards property
constraints, including genetic algorithms [20], Bayesian optimization [39, 50], REINFORCE [45],
and reinforcement learning [30]. Both sequential and graph-based generative models [6, 21, 30], along
with diverse sampling methods [47, 13], are used in conjunction with these algorithms to produce
desirable molecules. These methods have been applied to both single-objective and multi-objective
optimization, the latter by manually integrating multiple property conditions into a single one [5, 25].
Several challenges in molecular optimization methods remain underexplored, including the inadequate
or unclear definition of multi-property relations when integration into a single objective [5], and the
inaccessibility of the oracle function for property-oriented optimization during the training phase [14].

Conclusion

In this work, we solved inverse molecular design using properties as predictor-free diffusion guidance.
The proposed Graph DiT performed diffusion based on the joint distribution of atoms and bonds in
both forward and reverse processes. It introduced representation learning for multiple categorical and
numerical properties and utilized a Transformer-based graph denoiser for conditional graph denois-
ing. Results on multi-conditional generations and polymer inverse designs showed the remarkable
generative capabilities of Graph DiT, making it suitable for designing promising molecules.

A.1
Numerical Condition Encoding

We explore several approaches for encoding numerical conditions. In addition to the clustering-based
method, we consider:

1. The direct encoding approach, which employs a linear layer to map a continuous number
into a high-dimensional space.
2. The interval-based approach, as described in [28], divides the label space into NInterval
intervals. It then converts the number into an interval index, allowing us to apply one-hot
encoding for the number.

A.2
Neural Architecture for Conditions

Besides the AdaLN, there are two more options to integrate condition representation into molecular
graph representations [34]:

1. The In-Context conditioning approach adds the condition representation c to each row of
the molecular graph representation H after mapping the Xt
G into H using the linear layer in
the structure encoder.
2. The Cross-Attention approach concatenates the timestep encoding vector with the condition
representation from synthesis scores or task-related properties into a two-length sequence.
In each Transformer encoder layer, this is followed by a cross-attention layer at the end of
the standard multi-head self-attention layer.

Details on Datasets and Evaluation Methods

All experiments can be run on a single A6000 GPU card.

Datasets and Task Conditions

As presented in Table 4, we collect popular datasets in prediction tasks for more challenging molecular
generation tasks. We include a polymer dataset [40, 26] for material design. It consists of conditions
of O2, CO2, and N2, which study the numerical gas permeability for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and
nitrogen, respectively. Additionally, we also study the generative performance of different models
separately on the polymer data with O2, CO2, or N2, as illustrated in Table 4. We also create
three class-balanced molecule datasets from [46] for drug design: HIV, BBBP, and BACE, which
study categorical properties related to the inhibition of HIV virus replication, blood-brain barrier
permeability, and inhibition of human β-secretase 1, respectively. We aim to generate synthesizable

molecular distributions.

molecules. Therefore, we add two numerical conditions for synthetic complexity scores [12, 8] for
each of the tasks. For the gas separation polymer design task, we consider joint conditions for O2 and
N2 and measure the selectivity O2/N2 as the ratio between two gas permeability scores. All polymer
gas permeabilities are scaled in the log space following previous work [29]. We focus on experiments
for polymers and molecules within 50 nodes.

B.2
Evaluation and Metrics

We randomly split the dataset into training, validation, and testing (reference) sets in a 6:2:2 ratio.
We investigate more than eight metrics to systematically evaluate the generation performance. First,
we assess generation validity (Validity). Second, we evaluate the distribution learning capacity
of different models by measuring heavy atom type coverage (Coverage), internal diversity among
the generated examples using Tanimoto similarity (Diversity), fragment-based similarity with the
reference set (Similarity), and the Fr´echet ChemNet Distance with the reference set (Distance). Third,
we evaluate the model’s controllability by measuring the mean absolute error (MAE) between the
generated condition score and the actual condition scores if the condition is numerical; otherwise,
we measure the accuracy score. We follow previous work [14] to use the random forest trained on
all the available data as the Oracle evaluation function. For molecular optimization algorithms, we
train random forest predictors on the training set for conditional generation. For predictor-guided
diffusion models, DiGress v2 and MOOD, we use the same architecture as their denoising models to
train predictors for diffusion guidance. Given the conditions in the test set, we report the generation
performance by generating 10,000 examples for the six multi-conditional generation tasks and 1,000
examples for the polymer inverse design problem focused on selectivity.

B.3
Datasets and Tasks in Figure 1

Using the same dataset from the O2/N2 polymer inverse design task, we keep 100 polymers to
provide condition sets for testing and split the rest into training and validation sets in a 0.65:0.35 ratio.
We apply our proposed Graph DiT for both single-conditional and multi-conditional approaches,
focusing on three properties: (1) Synth. score for synthesizability [12], (2) O2 permeability, and
(3) N2 permeability. The single-conditional approach generates 30 polymers per condition for each
test data point, totaling 9,000 polymers. In contrast, the multi-conditional approach generates 30
polymers for each set of conditions per test data point, resulting in 3,000 polymers. We rank these
polymers based on the mean absolute error between the generated properties (evaluated by a random
forest model trained on all the data to simulate the Oracle function) and the conditional property. For
each test data point, we also rank the best multi-conditional polymer in different single-conditional

we generate three sets of polymers using a single-conditional approach for each condition. In (a), as
shown in Figure 1, we find the ranking of the shared structure for each multi-condition requirement.
In (b), polymers are generated using a multi-conditional approach, and for each, we identify the
highest ranking among the three single-conditional sets. Then, we calculate the median of these
maximum ranking positions, which is 16, approximately 2× better than single-conditional generation,
which has a median value greater than 30.

and visualize the minimum top K value distribution across all 100 test points.

In addition to Figure 1, we compute the median rankings of the multi-conditionally generated
polymers within the single-conditional sets. The results are shown in Figure 6. Both Figure 1
and Figure 6 demonstrate the advantages of multi-conditional generation over single-conditional
generation.

C
Details on Multi-Conditional Generation Results

We show results for three polymer generation tasks in Table 1 and molecule generation tasks in Table 2.
As complementary results for Table 1, we present new results on generation using only one gas
permeability in Table 5. We also compare the distributions of atom and bond types between generated
and training data in Figure 5. Furthermore, Figure 7 visualizes the two-dimensional molecular data
distribution of both training and generated molecules across various generative models.

C.1
Discussion on Diffusion Model Baselines

While diffusion models like GDSS [22] and DiGress [43] show promise in unconditional tasks, their
performance in multi-conditional generations needs improvement for fitting training distributions
and achieving more controllable results. As indicated by Figure 5(a), the generation of GDSS [22]
often collapses to carbon elements with Gaussian noise in the continuous diffusion state-space.
MOOD [25] improves atom type coverage by adding predictor guidance and an out-of-distribution
hyper-parameter, but it is hard to fit the training distribution, as visualized in Figure 7(h). DiGress and
its predictor-guided variant [43] (i.e., DiGress v2), using discrete state-space and transition matrices
for diffusion noise, outperform GDSS and MOOD in distribution fitting and internal diversity
in Tables 1, 2 and 5. However, as indicated in Figure 7(e) and Figure 7(f), these two models still
generate too many out-of-distribution examples without justification of the generalization capacity.
While GDSS and MOOD show lower average MAE in polymer conditional generation tasks, their
subpar distribution learning performance and the results from Table 2 suggest that this may be due to
the carbon element, which may be a confounder and affect the evaluation of the correlation between
the model and controllability in polymer tasks.

C.2
Discussion on Molecular Optimization Baselines

Popular molecular optimization baselines are competitive in molecular generation tasks. Earlier
studies have noted their strong performance: Gao et al. [14] showed their effectiveness in the standard
molecular optimizations with a combined optimization target, and Tripp and Hern´andez-Lobato [41]
found that genetic algorithm often outperforms recent methods in unconditional generation. We

observe their competitive performance in multi-conditional settings, characterized by high validity,
good atom type coverage, and distribution similarity in Tables 1, 2 and 5. MARS [47] and JTVAE [21]
perform well for controlling the synthetic accessibility score [12] but are less effective at controlling
specific task properties like gas permeability, BACE, BBBP, and HIV. For example, in generation
tasks with the categorical task condition, the generated examples only achieve around 50% accuracy
in hitting the input condition.

Discussion on Training Dynamics

In Figure 8, we illustrate changes in various indicators on the validation set during model training.
We note an increase in generated validity and similarity to the validation reference set, along with
a decrease in distance to the reference set and errors between generated properties and conditions,
indicating gradual improvement in conditional generation over epochs. However, a trade-off between
distribution fitting and internal diversity is observed in our current model, suggesting that further
work on enhancing generation diversity could be promising.

Figure 8: Change of indicators on the validation set during model training. The generated validity

C.4
Discussion on Uniqueness, and Novelty

We evaluate the model’s performance on Novelty and Uniqueness. Unlike unconditional generation,
multi-conditional generation involves generating multiple possible molecules under the same condi-
tion. Therefore, we compute these metrics across different sets of conditions rather than for generated
molecules under the same conditions. Results are presented in Table 7.

Graph DiT demonstrates reasonable performance on these metrics. However, higher Novelty and
Uniqueness values do not necessarily indicate better performance, as they may not reflect the model’s
ability to design satisfactory molecules with desirable properties. Moreover, these values risk leading
to misleading conclusions. For instance, AddCarbon achieves nearly perfect scores (99.94% Novelty

Details on Polymer Inverse Design

We aim to design polymers with high O2 and low N2 permeability, showing refined control of models
over these properties. This is reflected in the selectivity, defined as the O2/N2 permeability ratio.
Robeson [38] has identified an inherent trade-off between gas permeability and selectivity, known
as the upper-bound. Ideally, high-performance polymers should fall in the above-the-bound region,
demonstrating an effective combination of permeability and selectivity. We have 609 polymers with
annotated permeability values for both gases. 16 above-the-bound polymers are included in the
test/reference set and excluded from the training set. We generate 1,000 polymers conditional on test
set labels.

D.1
Survey Setup on Generated Polymers

Figure 9: The reference polymer structure in the case study has conditions {SAS=3.8, SCS=4.3,
O2Perm=34.0, N2Perm=5.2}.

We aim to gather expert evaluations on the generation performance of various methods. We conduct
a study using a test data point from the O2/N2 gas separation inverse design task, taking its properties
as conditions. The structure of the selected data point is presented in Figure 9. We display 25
generated polymers, each with its properties, alongside three real polymers from the training dataset
as references. The first real polymer serves as the test reference, while the other two, similar in
properties to the first, also aid experts in assessing the generated polymers. The properties of these
generated polymers are predicted using a well-trained random forest model. Experts are asked to
rank the generated polymers from 1 to 25, considering: (1) Structures of real polymers with desirable
properties; (2) Predicted properties of generated polymers, displayed beneath each visualization.
Here, a rank of 1 represents the best example as per domain knowledge, while 25 is the least favorable.
Rankings are then converted to utility scores (UtS) ranging from 0 to 1 using
1
ranking, allowing us to
quantify the relative performance of different generation methods. The agreement score (AS) could
be obtained by exp (−25 × Variance(UtS1, UtS2, UtS3, UtS4)), where UtSi denotes the utility score
from the i-th domain expert. (3) Finally, we select top-3 polymers for each generative models and
present them in Figure 3.

D.2
Results on Inverse Design

We present the inverse design results of all 1,000 generated polymers in validity, distribution learning,
and condition control in Table 6. # UB is the count of generated polymers successfully identified as
upper bound instances. Higher # UB indicates that Graph DiT has a higher likelihood of generating
candidates for excellent O2 and N2 gas separation. The smallest MAE across most properties and a
9.9% average MAE improvement over baselines highlight Graph DiT’s superior control in generating
examples closely aligned with multiple conditions.

E.1
Case Studies on Generation Controllability

We conduct a new case study on the O2/N2 polymer dataset, studying the controllability on three
properties synthesizability score, O2 and N2 properties with varied N2 property values. We select
a polymer example from the test set and vary its N2 while keeping other properties fixed. The N2
property from the test polymer is 213.75, and we vary it from 0 to 1000. We sample 50 values within
this range and generate 100 polymer graphs conditioned on multiple properties with each sampled
value. We evaluate various metrics, including the chemical validity of the generated polymers.

We visualize results in Figure 10. We consistently observe that validity and controllability per-
formance improve as the values approach 213.75, derived from a real test polymer. Conversely,
performance deteriorates when the sampled N2 values are closer to the extremes of the sampling
range (0 or 1000). This observation underscores the interdependency between conditions, where
less frequent combinations of different properties may be more challenging to learn. Moreover, the
model performs well across a elatively large range from 0 to 1000 in terms of validity, O2, and
synthesizability score control. This demonstrates good generalization of the proposed method in
capturing complex condition interdependencies.

Ablation Studies on Final MLP

In addition to the three components related to conditioning effectiveness of Graph DiT studied
in Section 4.4, we also examine the importance of the final layer MLP for conditional graph denoising.
Results in Figure 11 show that MLP significantly outperforms a linear layer [34].

Details on Oracle Simulation

We train three types of Oracles based on Random Forest, Gaussian Process, and Support Vector
Machine on all polymers or molecules in a task to evaluate the properties of generated polymers
conditional on O2Perm only, N2Perm only, CO2Perm only, BACE, BBBP, or HIV. The training
performance (MAE or AUC) is presented in Table 8. Our findings show that the random forest
achieves the lowest MAE and highest AUC scores, leading us to select it for simulating oracles in our
generation evaluation process.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Discussions on the proposed method and empirical support can be found in
sections 1, 3, and 4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Discussions on generation diversity and Oracle evaluations are found in
Sections 4.2 and 4.4.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”Limitations” section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

22


---Page Break---
Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper focuses on empirical studies.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details are in Section 4, appendix, and supplementary code.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

23


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Code is provided in the supplementary materials. Data and code will be on
Github after publication.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Details are in Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Improvement percentages (>10%) are discussed in Section 4.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

24


---Page Break---
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Discussions are in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conforms the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The work has positive societal impacts on designing molecules for drugs and
materials, as discussed in Sections 1 and 6.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

25


---Page Break---
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The work does not present issues of high-risk misuse.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All data sources and baseline models are open-sourced. They have been
properly credited and mentioned, as outlined in Section 4.1.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

26


---Page Break---
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The experiment results are verified through a survey conducted with a small
group of domain experts. However, no crowdsourcing experiments were conducted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

27


---Page Break---
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
