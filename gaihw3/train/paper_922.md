Abstract

Visual text generation has significantly advanced through diffusion models aimed
at producing images with readable and realistic text. Recent works primarily use
a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control
diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating
high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encod-
ing, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input
control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs
like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at
different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly
differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency do-
main. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed
to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve
input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information
and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to
align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we
introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation. The code
and dataset are available at https://github.com/CyrilSterling/TextGen.

Introduction

With the development of diffusion-based generative models [9, 26, 20] and image-text paired
datasets [23, 8], significant improvements have been made in the quality of image generation. Given
the prevalence of text in natural scenes (e.g., posters, slides, signs, book covers, etc.), generating
images containing text accurately and reasonably is crucial.

Recently, several methods have been proposed to address the generation of high-quality visual text
images [33, 14, 4, 28]. Among these, ControlNet-based approaches show strong potential [33, 28],
enabling flexible multilingual visual text generation, text position control, and easy integration into
existing pre-trained diffusion models. Current methods directly utilize ControlNet [36] for text
generation control, using a global glyph image of a standard font as the condition (as shown in
Figure 1). However, achieving accurate and robust control remains challenging due to the complex
and fine-grained structure of characters. Hence, we pose a meaningful question: How does control
information influence multilingual text image generation?

To address the above issue, we investigate the impact of control information on visual text generation
from three perspectives, as illustrated in Figure 1. For the input of control information, the current
model uses a glyph image to guide the generation of accurate text textures. However, unlike general
ControlNet inputs such as Canny edges, depth, or M-LSD lines, text glyph images have unique

properties: 1) Glyph images have areas of high information density concentrated within specific
regions, with the rest being meaningless backgrounds. 2) Generation in text region is fine-grained, but
extracting fine-grained features from glyph images using standard convolution methods is challenging
(further discussed in Sec. 3.1.1). These properties limit the performance. For the control information
in different time steps, current models follow ControlNet [36] by using fixed control, but they often
overlook the role of different time steps in the generation process. We further explore the impact of
control at various steps in Sec. 3.1.2. Control in early steps influences both text and non-text regions,
ensuring that the background reasonably matches the text. Control in late steps still plays a significant
role in modifying mistakes, which is different from the general generation [2, 15]. For the output of
control feature, these features are injected into the U-Net decoder, which receives three types of
features: base, skip, and control. Each of these components differs in the frequency domain, which
explains their respective roles (discussed in Sec. 3.1.3). Balancing these components during inference
is crucial. Overall, we explore the influence of control information in text generation, raising several
critical questions essential for advancements in visual text generation.

Based on the analysis above, we introduce TextGen, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the
quality of control information. Specifically, for control input, we introduce a Fourier Enhancement
Convolution (FEC) block to extract spatial and frequency features from the glyph control image. This
operation can enhance the perception of useful regions and edge textures. For the output control
feature, we introduce a frequency balancing factor to adjust the frequency information among the
features during inference. For the control information in different stages, we propose a two-stage
framework for coarse-to-fine generation. This framework trains the first-stage model for global control
and the second-stage model for detail control. Based on the two-stage framework, we naturally
propose a novel inference paradigm for unifying text generation and editing tasks. Furthermore, as
current datasets for visual text generation are large-scale and noisy, we construct a lightweight but
high-quality dataset for effective training (details provided in Appendix A). Unlike previous works,
we were the first to delve into control information in the visual text generation task. Our framework
enhances the quality of detail generation while elegantly achieving unified generation and editing
tasks. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

• We conducted an in-depth study and discussion on the impact of control information in
visual text generation tasks. Our findings can inspire more future research in this area.
• We propose a framework for multilingual visual text generation and editing based on our
analysis, which contains a two-stage pipeline and a Fourier enhancement in both training
and inference. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.
• We construct an open-source effective and lightweight dataset for the training of visual text
generation and editing.

Text Generation

With the advancement of denoising diffusion probabilistic models [9, 26] and text-to-image gen-
eration [22, 2, 20], it has become possible to generate high-quality images. However, visual text
generation remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained alignment and character detail
representation. Recent studies, such as Imagen [22] and eDiff-I [2], have focused on improving text

generation from the perspective of text encoders. They found that T5-based encoders [19] outperform
CLIP text encoders [18]. GlyphDraw [14] presents a robust baseline for visual text generation by
incorporating conditions. It utilizes a glyph image representing a single word as the content condition
and a mask image as the positional condition. However, GlyphDraw is limited to generating only
one text line per image. GlyphControl [33] further introduces a ControlNet-based framework that
employs a global glyph image as the condition, providing both glyph and positional information,
achieving outstanding generation performance. Glyph-ByT5 [13] fine-tunes a T5 language model for
paragraph-level visual text generation, achieving remarkable performance in dense text generation.
However, it is restricted to producing text in English. We propose an effective multilingual framework
by controlling information enhancement in a ContorlNet-based framework.

2.2
Text Editing

Scene text editing aims to replace text in a scene image with new text while preserving the original
background and style. Early approaches focused on generating text on cropped images, allowing
for more precise text area generation [34, 10, 11, 24, 30, 17]. SRNet [30] was the first to divide the
editing task into three sub-processes: background inpainting, text conversion, and fusion, which
inspired subsequent works [17, 21, 32]. Although these methods achieved excellent generation
performance, integrating the cropped text area into the original scene images proved challenging such
as edge inconsistency. Recently, leveraging the diffusion model, some approaches have conducted
generation on complete scene images directly, without decomposing the task into sub-processes.
DiffUTE [3] proposes a concise framework for directly generating the edited global scene image using
the diffusion process. However, solely focusing on the complete editing task limits the practicality
and generalization of the model.

2.3
Joint Text Generation and Editing

Due to the similarity between visual text generation and editing tasks, developing a unified framework
to jointly address these tasks is meaningful. TextDiffuser [5, 4] employs a mask to indicate areas
requiring editing, ensuring multitasking uniformity. During the generation task, the mask remains
empty, while during the editing task, it preserves areas that do not require editing. Additionally,
TextDiffuser introduces a layout generator to design the distribution of text lines. Similarly, Any-
Text [28] adopts a comparable approach to maintain the uniformity of two tasks and further enhances
generation quality with a text embedding module and perceptual loss. Building on our explorations,
we propose a two-stage model and design a novel inference paradigm to achieve multitasking unity.

Method

3.1
Motivations

3.1.1
Control Information Input

In recent works, the inputs of the control module are the glyph image and position image, which
provide the texture and position condition for text regions. However, different from general ControlNet
conditions (e.g., Canny edge, M-LSD lines, depth, etc.), text conditions have distinct characteristics.
As illustrated in Figure 2, general ControlNet conditions typically influence only macroscopic
coarse-grained style and global edges, and some incorrect minor texture generation is considered
acceptable. However, small differences in texture details can lead to content errors or unrealistic
and unreasonable textures in visual text generation. Therefore, using the general ControlNet poses
challenges in controlling detailed textures and fine-grained handwriting. Moreover, the text glyph
condition concentrates only on certain regions, making it a sparse condition unlike other general
conditions. This characteristic causes the convolution-based ControlNet encoder to introduce noise
in empty areas when extracting features, which interferes with the text area’s features and affects
the correct allocation of attention between edge and background areas. Enhancing the ControlNet
encoder’s perception of locally useful details and edge information is essential for improving text
image generation. Meanwhile, the characteristic of having high information density in local areas
suggests that we can seek solutions in the frequency domain.

3.1.2
Control Information in Different Denoising Stages

Some studies on general diffusion [15, 2] have suggested that control information in the later stages
of the denoising process contributes little to the diffusion model. However, due to the specific nature
of text, where text strokes constitute detailed information, we find that control in the later stages
remains crucial. As shown in Figure 3 (a), omitting control information in the later stages often results
in incorrect text content generation. The control module in these later stages corrects such errors,
ultimately leading to high-quality images. This finding indicates that performing the editing task at a
late time step is reasonable, as it mitigates the performance impact of joint multi-task training.

Furthermore, we investigate the role of early control. As shown in Figure 3 (b), the control information
in early steps has a significant impact on the global semantics of the generated image, aiding in the
alignment of text areas with the global scene. Without the control information in the early steps, the
generated text regions appear unreasonable and do not match the background. Notably, even though
only glyph and position images provide control information, the early stages still strongly influence
the generation of non-text regions (the non-text areas may be totally different).

control stage. Control information utilizes a Fourier Enhancement Convolution (FEC) block and a
Spatial Convolution (SC) block to extract features. During inference, we introduce a novel denoising
paradigm to unify generation and editing based on our framework design. Best shown in color.

Therefore, the control information of different stages should be adapted according to these findings.
We divide the control module into global and detail stages (Fig. 4), each with distinct parameters. In
the global control stage, we expect that the control information can affect the entire image, while
in the detail control stage, we incorporate a mask to guide the model in optimizing local details.
Furthermore, the detail stage can act as a refiner in text generation and as an editor in text editing.

During inference, the output of the control module is

Each layer
in the U-Net decoder can be formulated as:
Fi

Di(Fi−1, Si−1, Ci−1), where Di is the i-th layer, Fi is
the output feature of i-th layer, Si and Ci represent the
skip feature and the control feature of i-th layer, respec-
tively. These three parts of the input represent different
types of information. Following FreeU [25], we further
investigate the balance among these three components. As
shown in Fig. 5, we visualize the Fourier relative log am-
plitudes of F, S and C. It can be observed that the skip
feature contains more high-frequency information than the
base feature, which may infer denoising (the same conclu-
sion with [25]). Therefore, there is a need for balancing
between the base feature and the skip feature. Furthermore,
compared with the fusion feature, the control feature has
more high and low-frequency information, with a greater
gap at low frequencies than at high frequencies. How-
ever, since we only aim to control the texture, which belongs to high-frequency information, the
low-frequency information needs to be suppressed.

3.2
Pipeline

Based on the motivations and discussions above, we propose a novel framework named TextGen.
The pipeline of our TextGen is illustrated in Figure 4. During training, our model comprises two
stages: the global stage and the detail stage. The parameters of the pre-trained diffusion U-Net are

fixed, and each stage only trains a ControlNet. The global control stage is trained exclusively on
larger time steps, while the detail control stage is trained only on smaller time steps. Through such an
operation, the global control stage focuses on structure and style construction, and the detail control
stage concentrates on detail modification. In this section, we first detail the control design in Sec. 3.3.
Then, we describe the enhancement of control information output in Sec. 3.4. Finally, we propose a
novel inference paradigm for task unification using our model in Sec. 3.5.

Figure 6: (a) The Spatial Convolution Block. (b)
The Frequency Enhancement Convolution Block.

The global control stage receives two pieces of
control information: a position image indicating
the text positions and a glyph image indicating
the standard font of the texts. We use Spatial
Convolution (SC) block and Fourier Enhance-
ment Convolution (FEC) block to extract the
feature of position image and glyph image, re-
spectively. The structures of SC and FEC are
illustrated in Figure 6. In SC, we employ gen-
eral convolution for spatial perception, whereas
in FEC, we use two branches for information
extraction. The spatial branch is similar to SC,
while the frequency branch employs a 2D Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to transform
the features into the frequency domain and per-
forms convolution in this domain. Subsequently,
an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithm is used to transform the frequency features back.
Additionally, the input layer of both blocks is a global perception operation, achieved through convo-
lution with a large kernel size. This is because the text contains global semantic information, and the
general convolution-based encoder has a local receptive field that limits information interaction.

The detail control stage receives three pieces of control information: a position image, a glyph
image, and a masked image. Unlike the global control stage, the detail control stage incorporates the
masked image as one of its inputs, aiming to provide background information. This stage is designed
to generate specified texts at designated positions while keeping the background consistent with the
masked image. The module’s output is multiplied by a position mask, enabling the model to focus on
modifying the detailed texture of the text area. It’s worth noting that the mask is only applied in the
last two layers of the U-Net decoder (for feature sizes greater than or equal to 32). This is because
the first two layers (feature sizes less than 32) primarily handle global information, which contributes
little to the detailed texture. Moreover, by retaining the first two layers without applying the mask,
we ensure that the background of the output image remains consistent with the masked image while
modifying inconsistent areas.

Discussion: The frequency enhancement block performs convolution operations in both spatial
and frequency domains, offering two main benefits: 1) The Fourier transform of visual features
provides global information about the glyph image, overcoming the limitations of the receptive field
in spatial convolution. 2) The glyph image contains both localized detail-rich areas and meaningless
backgrounds. Convolution in the frequency domain acts as a frequency filter, allowing for the
adjustment of attention to different frequency components. This facilitates the extraction of useful
information and mitigates the interference of irrelevant information from a global perspective.

3.4
Enhancement for Control Information Output

In our framework, each layer of the U-Net decoder receives three parts of information: the backbone
feature F, the skip feature S, and the control feature C. As discussed in Sec. 3.1.3, there is a need for
balancing among three parts during inference. Therefore, we propose a Fourier enhancement method
as formulated as follows:

Fi+1 = Di+1([Si + αC′
i, βF′
i]),

C′
i = F −1(F(C′
i) ⊙γ),

where F and F −1 represent FFT and IFFT, ⊙denotes the element-wise multiplication. α and β
are balancing factors for the control feature and the base feature. γ is a modulation factor in the
frequency domain. Although enhancing high-frequency information is desired, directly doing so will
introduce noise and reduce generation quality. Therefore, we suppress low-frequency information to
emphasize high-frequency components. This is achieved using a scalar s to suppress low-frequency
information as follows:

γ(r) =
s
if r < rthresh,

otherwise.

3.5
Inference Paradigm for Multi-task

Based on our model and analysis, we propose a novel inference paradigm for task unification. For
the image generation task, random noise is inputted into the global control stage for the early T/2
steps and the detail control stage for the remaining steps. For the text editing task, the original
image is first noise-added to 80% time-step, which maintains most of the global style and texture
while destroying the original text content. Then the new text content is first generated using the global
control stage until the T/2 time step, and the remaining time steps use the detail control stage to
modify the details. Since the control input of the detail control stage contains the masked original
image, it can restore the background information that was destroyed during the noise addition, and at
the same time optimize the new text content at the specified location.

Experiments

4.1
Datasets

Recently, several works have introduced datasets for text generation and editing tasks. TextDiffuser [5,
4] introduced a dataset named MARIO-10M, comprising approximately 10 million images annotated
with bounding boxes and content of text regions. AnyText [28] proposed a benchmark named
AnyWord for evaluation. However, training on 10 million images requires significant computing
resources. Therefore, we introduce TG2M, a multilingual dataset sourced from publicly available
images including MARIO-10M [5], Wukong [8], TextSeg [31], ArT [6], LSVT [27], MLT [16],
ReCTS [37]. Although TG2M contains significantly fewer images, it is highly effective for training
and achieves superior performance. The dataset will be detailed in the Appendix A.

4.2
Implementation Details

In our implementation, the diffusion model is initialized from SD1.52, and our code is based on
diffusers3. The text embedding module follows AnyText [28]. We train our model on the TG2M
dataset using 8 NVIDIA A40 GPUs with a batch size of 176. Our model converges rapidly and
requires only 5 epochs of training. The learning rate is set to 1e-5. Following previous generation
and recognition works [35, 29, 28, 7], we set the maximum length of each text line to 20 characters
and the maximum number of lines in each image to 5. During inference, the Fourier balance factors
α, β, and s are set to 1.4, 1.2, and 0.2, respectively.

We evaluate our model on the AnyWord [28] benchmark. We use DuGuangOCR 4 to recognize the
text region and measure performance using sentence accuracy (ACC), Normalized Edit Distance
(NED), and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). During inference, the settings (random seed, control
strength, etc.) are consistent across all experiments.

4.3
Ablation Study

Owing to resource constraints, following AnyText [28], we randomly select 200k images (40k English
and 160k Chinese) from TG2M as the training set for ablation. The results are shown in Tab. 1.

From the table, we observe the following: 1) All proposed methods yield performance gains in both
Chinese and English text generation. 2) The FEC block enhances edge and texture features through
Fourier enhancement, with more significant gains in Chinese due to the greater complexity of Chinese
characters. It is worth noting that our model trained only on 200k images can achieve 61.42% and
60.18% sentence accuracy on Chinese and English text generation, which is almost as good as the
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale training sets.

Comparison Results

4.4.1
Quantitative Results

Compared to other methods, our approach uses less data while outperforming the state-of-the-art,
as shown in Table 2. For a fair comparison, all methods are evaluated under the same settings. The
performance of both the baseline and TextGen is assessed using four random seeds, with the final
metrics reported as averages and standard deviations. Our method achieves a 9.1% gain in sentence
accuracy for English texts and a 2.9% gain for Chinese texts compared to our baseline trained on
TG-2M. Notably, other approaches require large amounts of training data and employ perceptual
loss to enhance performance, which is training-inefficient. Our method, in contrast, does not require
additional losses and converges faster, making it easier to train. Besides, we compute the FID on
the AnyWord-FID [28] benchmark. Our FID scores achieve comparable performance but not the
best. The higher FID score does not necessarily imply the lower visual quality of the generated
images. Our generated images demonstrate greater diversity and there is a distribution gap between
our training set and AnyWord. This issue is discussed in more detail in Appendix C.

4.4.2
Qualitative Results

The qualitative comparison is shown in Fig.7. Our TextGen produces high-quality images with text in
various scenarios and excels in generating artistic text with a wide range of visually appealing styles.
For Chinese text, as demonstrated in Fig.8, TextGen generates more realistic and readable results,
particularly in smaller texts. Finally, Fig. 9 illustrates the editing capabilities of our model, which can
edit various text styles and contents using the proposed inference paradigm.

Limitations

We propose a novel diffusion-based network for multilingual text generation and editing, which
demonstrates robust performance. Our network excels at generating high-quality scene images with
text. However, the framework based on latent diffusion presents certain limitations. 1) The VAE
employed in latent diffusion restricts the performance of fine-grained texture generation, particularly
for complex texts. Because the diffusion process operates in the latent feature space, the VAE decoder
struggles to generate small or complex texts. Consequently, our method is unable to generate such
images. This issue can be addressed by generating each local sub-region separately. 2) The text
condition controls the content of the generated image. However, the CLIP text encoder has limited
ability to comprehend text, resulting in performance limitations. To resolve this issue, we can pre-train
the diffusion model with a large language model serving as the text condition encoder.

Moreover, generating false text can contribute to the spread of misinformation, potentially resulting
in serious consequences. It is hoped that this technology will be used responsibly, fostering a healthy
and ethical academic environment.

Conclusion

Based on ControlNet, current visual text generation has made significant progress. In this work, we
build on recent studies using ControlNet to investigate how control information influences visual
text generation from three perspectives: control input, control at different stages, and control output.
Through experiments and discussions, we derive several key conclusions. Based on our analysis,
we propose a novel visual text generation framework that improves control information utilization,
which surpasses the state-of-the-art performance. We believe the insights we gained about control
information can inspire future research in the community.

A
Details of Dataset

To train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich
textual data. The images in this dataset are sourced from existing open-source datasets, including
MARIO-10M [5], Wukong [8], ArT [6], LSVT [27], MLT [16], ReCTS [37], TextSeg [31]. Following
AnyText [28], we filter the images with some rules, which can devided into three steps. Specifically,
the filtering rules of the first step include:

• The images of width smaller than 256 will be filtered out.
• The images with aspect ratio larger than 2.0 or smaller than 0.5 will be filtered out.

After step 1, we use PP-OCR5 to detect and recognize the texts in these images. Then, we undergo
the second filtering step:

• The images with more than 10 texts will be filtered out.
• The images with more than 3 small texts will be filtered out. The small text refers to
horizontal text with a height of less than 30 pixels or vertical text with a width of less than
30 pixels. The orientation of the text is determined by the aspect ratio of the text bounding
box, with an aspect ratio less than 0.5 considered vertical text.
• Images containing more than 3 text instances with recognition scores below 0.7 will be
filtered out.

We use BLIP-2 [12] and Qwen-VL [1] to recaption the images. First, we generate initial captions
using BLIP-2. Because some initial captions are low-quality, we then modify these captions using
Qwen-VL. The low-quality captions are defined as those containing meaningless text or having low
CLIP similarity with the reference image. This process is necessary because some captions generated
by BLIP-2 are meaningless, as shown in Fig. 10. Additionally, although Qwen-VL’s captions are of
high quality, many of them are quite lengthy, which can affect the understanding of the CLIP text
encoder in the diffusion model.

Discussion about the Two-Stage Framework

We propose a two-stage generation framework that achieves detail optimization and task unification.
However, this enhancement does not notably improve recognition accuracy in our ablation study. This
is because: 1) The first stage already allows for some detailed modifications. 2) Our ablation study
was conducted on a subset of the TG-2M dataset. The second stage enhances texture details, but
its performance is limited with insufficient data. On the complete dataset, the two-stage framework
demonstrates better performance, as detailed in Table 4.

Discussion about FID

The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric evaluates the distribution gap between generated images
and target images. A higher FID indicates a larger distribution gap. We evaluate the FID score on the
AnyWord [28] benchmark, which provides a subset of images for this purpose. Since the AnyWord
FID benchmark is derived from the AnyWord training set, it is reasonable for AnyText to achieve a
better FID score due to the distribution gap between our TG-2M and AnyWord. Additionally, our
TextGen can generate more artistic texts, resulting in a diversity of distribution. Therefore, a lower
FID score does not necessarily imply a lower visual quality of the generated images.

D
Discussion about Future Work

Based on ControlNet, current visual text generation has made significant progress. We further
investigate the control information in ControlNet-based visual text generation tasks and draw several
conclusions. Future performance improvements can be achieved through three approaches: 1)
Construct high-quality datasets, as current datasets still contain incorrect labels and unreasonable
captions. 2) Enhance the text embedding module. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), we can

design a more robust text embedding module than the CLIP text encoder, capable of understanding
more detailed captions.

E
More Qualitative Results

We present additional qualitative results generated by TextGen in Fig. 12. TextGen produces realistic
images with coherent and readable text. Additionally, TextGen is capable of generating artistic text
for applications such as logos, posters, and clothing design.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the influence of control information in visual text generation. The
abstract and the introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the limitation of our work in Section 5.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
Answer: [Yes]

16


---Page Break---
Justification: Our investigations are validated by experiments and visualizations.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental
results of the paper in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The details about our datasets are provided in
the Appendix.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

17


---Page Break---
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release our code and dataset after accepted.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We detailed all of these in Section 4.2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the suitable error bar in Table 2.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

18


---Page Break---
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide all of the information in Section 4.2.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The work is about text generation, which does not have societal impact.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

19


---Page Break---
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not release new assets.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
